| 0:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=125)|

| 0:02:20| Discussion and possible action against beer permittees that are delinquent in paying their annual beer privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| Loyal Order of Moose No. 1560, 6909 Mundell Road, On Premises, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=146)|
| 0:02:39| Is anyone present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=159)|
| 0:02:49| Moose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| Mr. Chairman, could you read a list of those that we're expecting to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| The Loyal Order of Moose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| Los Grosso's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| And the pavilion at Hunter Farm, Hunter Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Y'all want to see your attorneys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Okay, hold on one second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| You'll be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| Loyal Order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=199)|
| 0:03:34| Senator, can you go ahead and give us the testimony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| The moose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| At the end of November, 1st of December, annually, we send out a letter, a notice, to each company or business bar that has a beer permit in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=224)|
| 0:03:59| There is a $100 per year beer privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| It's an annual fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| And they have until January 31st to pay this annual tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| This Loyal Order of Moose, excuse me, has not paid theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| And they did receive a certified letter, which they signed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| We did receive a return receipt, so they are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| And I have spoken to them about the situation and it not being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=270)|
| 0:04:39| Did anyone from the company contact you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Not since the agenda went out, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Prior to that, I did speak with someone from the Moose Lodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| So, if they have not paid their beer fee, do they still have a right to have a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Well, that would be up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| The commission has the option that they may revoke the permit, they may suspend the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| That's the two remedies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| Until it's paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Until it's paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Or you can revoke it outright and it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| But, of course, if you do that, the property loses the right for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| So, those are the two remedies for non-payment of tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Didn't we have something similar this last year where somebody did not pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| and then we allowed them to pay it within a certain length of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Normally, if they do come before the board, they either pay it that day or within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=348)|
| 0:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| So, the best course of action at this point would be to suspend the license until the fee is paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=365)|
| 0:06:13| Well, to suspend, that would be up to the commission to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=373)|
| 0:06:21| I mean, they were properly notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| They were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| And acknowledged that they were supposed to appear today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Are you prepared today to pay that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| It's not him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| It's not him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| They're not here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| They're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| They're not here, but it's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| Let's suspend until they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Commissioner Reiter, do you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| I was going to repeat what I thought I heard there a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| If they were here today, they could pay today, or having seven days to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| I would suggest we suspend seven days from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Or until the fee is paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| That the motion be to suspend seven days in the future until such time as they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=433)|
| 0:07:21| Because if they were here today, they would have seven days to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| But they wouldn't be suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| They would agree today to pay within the next seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Within the next seven days, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| And all I'm suggesting is, and I'm not going to make a motion to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| but I would suggest that we suspend seven days from today, that they be sent for nonpayment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| that they be sent a letter first thing in the morning, again, certified mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| saying they have seven, giving the date that they have to be paid by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| else it's suspended that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| I was going to say I agree, but I was wanting to say what Commissioner Bussler wanted to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| I would like to make a comment before Bussler possibly makes a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| If someone took the effort and the time to show up today, I believe in cutting them seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| But these people failed to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| I'm not sure we shouldn't just suspend their license until they come and pay the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Can you make a motion to, with that date period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| if they do not pay within seven days they're automatically suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| or do we have to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| How can we make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Pretty close to what you just said, we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| I make a motion that in seven days from the time of receipt of the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| if they're not responded to, to pay that $100, it's automatically suspended at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| If you do that, it takes a while to get back the certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| No, certified from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Okay, from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| That's providing they pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Okay, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| That's providing they pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| These will suspend their license seven days from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| If they don't come pay within the next seven days, we suspend their license until they come pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| When you spoke with them, did you call them or did they call you or what was the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Normally what happens is if they have not paid by the end of January, I call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| and most people go ahead and pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| These folks I did speak to actually several times, and I called them and they called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=593)|
| 0:10:02| I think one problem that they have, it seems that every year they have different people taking care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=602)|
| 0:10:12| I might also give them a call in the morning, and they may say, okay, yeah, I thought he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| I thought they were going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| I'll run it down there right now, and we may solve a lot of problems really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| The problem that I think that I did not address in my original discussion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| if we suspended their license today, when would it be reinstated at our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| No, when they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| When they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| It must be suspended until they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Wolfie, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| If you suspend or whatever you do, the alcohol companies will have to come out and take all of the stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=655)|
| 0:11:06| and then they will have to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Usually in less than 30 days they'll just leave the alcohol there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=668)|
| 0:11:19| Okay, so we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| The motion is to suspend in seven days if they have not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=682)|
| 0:11:33| Point of clarification, seven business days or seven calendar days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Let's set a date for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Calendar days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Which is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| April 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| April 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| It's specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| And at that point it would be suspended until payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| I'll amend the motion until April 2nd. How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=718)|
| 0:12:11| What does it matter if they come and get the beer if they don't have a license to sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| Then we'll really get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| Wolfie, I'd like your opinion on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| If the beer's there, I think it'll be for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| Kevin, you said it would take them 30 days to come and get it anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| No, it said less than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| They won't pick it up unless it's—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| They won't come and get it if it's less than 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| No, it's not worth their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| But if they don't come pick it up before April 2nd, it will be 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| because they won't have the ability to get their permit back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Well, I guess they would if they paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| I think we're making them out now of Mohill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| They're probably going to run the $100 check up here on Tuesday morning once they're notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| One thing, too, they have to have a current business tax license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| Sometimes that's the reason that some of them are delayed in payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| because they are not up to date on their business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=795)|
| 0:13:23| The law director suggested that we amend this to say give them seven days to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| and if they don't, suspend their license for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| At a minimum of 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| At a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Even if they are up on payment, you know, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| According to Chief May there, if you suspend it for less than 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| they won't come and get the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| But if you make a motion to suspend seven days from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| suspend their license for a minimum of 30 days or until they pay after 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| So if they pay within the seven, they're not suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| But if they pay on the eighth day, they don't get reinstated for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| But if they never pay, the suspension goes into perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| I'll make a motion to amend it to after seven days, if it's not paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| then we suspend the license for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| A minimum of 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| A minimum of 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Or until it's paid after 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Or until it's paid after 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| The second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| Is that the end of the discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| We have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Jose El Soto, Las Grasas, 6356 Clinton Highway, on and off premises, District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| Sir, how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I guess you just heard the previous discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Do you have a check for $100 for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Yeah, they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| We can do it with the credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| They do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| We have 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| 3% charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Do we need to make a motion to do the seven-day thing for him, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| and then he can just immediately pay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| So, whose district is this in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| It's 7th and Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| Well, it had to roll around sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Anyway, I make a motion that we suspend for seven days or until it's paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| We give him seven days to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Seven days to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Or if he's got a credit card today, we'll take it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| And then if he doesn't pay, it's suspended after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Does he have time to get up to the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| No, he won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| He'll have to do it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| He'll have to do it tomorrow, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| But I think the proper motion is he has seven days from today to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| or face a suspension of a minimum of 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| and then reinstated after that 30 days upon payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| We have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Sir, from today you have seven days to get back up here and pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Okay, do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1010)|

| 0:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| It's a good motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1036)|

| 0:17:19| No, go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I was just going to say some of you may remember about two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| we had a problem with this institution where the alcohol and beverage control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| cited them for serving guests without an alcohol permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| and then there was a lot of problems with the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| You'd think that after all of that that they went through two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| they'd have been right on top of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Did they get receipt of the letter and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| They did not pick up the certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| I did speak with Ms. Barger, the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| and she indicated that they were going to surrender their permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| and that she would have it surrendered by last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| but I have not heard from her since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1080)|

| 0:18:45| and then suspend for a minimum of 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| and then at that time if they make payment the suspension is lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1129)|

| 0:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| Is there any other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| Commissioner Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Yes, and this is for the new applicants in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Apparently, last month we had 15 businesses in Knox County sell beer to underage people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| and they'll be addressed in the next two months at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| So, just be aware we do have people out there checking to see if you're selling beer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| So we hope we don't see you here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| Are we going to change the time next month to 3 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| No, I think we're going to split them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Eight is still a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I thought maybe we'd let Wolfie come up and explain how many people they actually checked on in the past 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1694)|
| 0:28:23| if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| Two weeks ago we conducted a undercover beer sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| We checked 119 places in Knox County and cited 16 businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| These were convenience stores and grocery stores, no risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| Sir, that's actually a better ratio than we had last year, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| I mean, more compliance going on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| It seems like last year was very heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| I think we had 21 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| Still a lot of people still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Yes, still a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Wolfie, thank you so much for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| I just want to reemphasize they haven't checked any restaurants at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| So I do want to say congratulations for taking over the Spicys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| I love spicy wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| I missed the one on Cumberland very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| So I hope you all have that same recipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| I'm looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Maybe we might get some commission after they open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| As long as it's under $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| By the way, on the numbers that Wolfie just gave, of the 119, that's 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| over 13% of the businesses were in violation of selling beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1779)|
| 0:29:49| Nothing else before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1790)|
| 0:29:59| I call to order this March meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1799)|

| 0:30:29| Commissioner Daly, will you give us our devotional, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| I'd like to introduce my friend and pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| I've known him for, we kind of discussed about 50 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| So he does know stories on me, but I know some on him also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| But this is my pastor, Reverend Tommy Bellamy from Pathways Church here on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| First off, I want to say it's a privilege to be here and just to be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| It's a thankless task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| I would not want your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| You can chuckle at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| But it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| It's a privilege, and I thank God that we do live in a country where we have democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| and that voices can be heard and things can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| And so I would just like to open, and I would like to pray in the Christian faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| Would you bow your heads with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Heavenly Father, we thank you for your grace, your mercy, and your love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1886)|

| 0:32:07| but you would bless them as people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1927)|

| 0:32:47| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1967)|

| 0:33:02| It's time for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1982)|

| 0:33:08| Mr. Harris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1988)|

| 0:33:16| Would you rather speak now or would you rather wait to speak to a specific item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| The item that we had, I think, was the fifth item on the road closure on Twin Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| We need to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Yes, it would probably be best if it's easier to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2009)|

| 0:35:02| Yes, I would, and I'd like to have it read into record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| At this time, I'm going to come down to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| and if I could have all my Gresham Middle School team and coaches and assistants please join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2108)|
| 0:35:30| Whereas Sammy Long is an eighth grade student with autism at Gresham Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| and whereas Sammy tried out for the basketball team this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| hoping to make the team despite the expectation of others that he'd be a team manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| and whereas during tryouts, Coach Joel Samsel was impressed with Sammy's energy, enthusiasm, and work ethic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2145)|
| 0:35:54| and when he saw a close bond and friendship developing between Sammy and the other boys on the basketball team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| he knew that Sammy was meant to be a player on the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| and whereas Coach Joel Samsel and the entire varsity team surprised Sammy in his classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| by presenting him with a jersey and congratulating him for becoming a player on the team and not the team manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| and whereas in spite of the long and hard basketball practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| Sammy worked tirelessly with the other teammates who would lift him with encouraging words and actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2182)|
| 0:36:31| and whereas Sammy's first shot came in a scrimmage against CAK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| and after 20 minutes of play, Sammy took the court, and with the crowded gym chanting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| Sammy, Sammy, he made a three-point shot that brought the entire crowd to its feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| and whereas Sammy often entered games when Gresham had a comfortable lead on the fourth quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| and when he entered the game, his teammates worked hard to set him up for a deep three-pointer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| and he made several of these shots, setting off a frenzy in the crowd and on the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| and whereas Sammy made such a positive impact on the team that the team's MVP, Darian Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| had selflessly asked Coach Samsell if he could give Sammy his starting spot in the eighth grade night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| and when Darian told Sammy of the opportunity just moments before the announcer called Sammy's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| Sammy's wide, infectious smile warmed every heart in the gym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| and whereas the Gresham Middle School basketball team ended the season winning the Knox County Tournament Championship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| and the Countywide Sportsmanship Award, that more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| these accomplishments is the friendship between Sammy and the team that formed during the season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| and whereas Sammy made a measurable contribution to his team and classmates in the basketball season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| an experience that also enriched Sammy's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| and whereas the commission of Knox County desires to recognize and commend Samuel Long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| Coach Joel Samsell, and the entire Gresham Middle School basketball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| as we begin our celebration of the 2018 National Autism Awareness Month in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| the commission of Knox County hereby honors Samuel, Sammy Long, Coach Joel Samsell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| and the Gresham Middle School boys' basketball team for teaching everyone associated with the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| the school, the community, and all of us a lesson in acceptance, appreciation, inclusion, and friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Samuel Long, Coach Joel Samsell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| and the Gresham Middle School basketball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2344)|
| 0:39:22| I want to say thank you to all my fellow commissioners and for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Is Mayor Burchett in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| Mayor Burchett worked a lot with Autism Sammy when he was our state senator in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| and was very much aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I first heard this story on Channel 10, as some of y'all may have, back in, I believe, early part of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2381)|
| 0:39:50| And Channel 10 had gone out to do a story on this, and when I saw it, I was just, it was very emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2390)|
| 0:39:59| And it just brought back what all the good is being done with the young men and young women in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| and all of our educational partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| And to see a team come together on what life is really all about, guys, basketball, sports, is fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2413)|
| 0:40:22| but when you get out of school, a lot of times that ends and it just becomes, it's more recreational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| So to have these friends and to realize that friendship is all in what makes life go on from every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2427)|
| 0:40:36| that will lead you all the way through college and beyond to your old years like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| So when I told them that I was a former Gresham Gladiator, they kind of went, yeah, I was a former Gresham Gladiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| Very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| They are changing their colors, you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| I've got my more cardinal red on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| We always wore maroon, more like the folder here, and gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| So we're following in steps with our next adventure, which is Central High School, which will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| all of them were eighth graders that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| The one guy who gave up his starting position for Samuel on eighth grade night was, let me recall his name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2470)|
| 0:41:20| Darian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Darian, who is not able to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| And also Principal Donna Parker is not able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| They were having all the new ones coming up from the elementary school's parents' night tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| So that is why Principal Donna Parker is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| But the rest of them will all be going to Central, except this one right here is zoned for Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| which is also one of my schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| In my opinion, I represent the two best high schools in Knox County, Fulton High School and Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| So I'm not holding that against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| So I would like to have Mayor Burchett and the coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| I want you all to meet our coach because, you know, these boys are all such leaders, but you're only as good as your leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2520)|
| 0:42:08| So it says a lot about their coach and instilling this type of leadership in these young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| So if you'd like to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you very much for allowing me to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Our motto for the whole year was it's bigger than basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| And that's been from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| It's bigger than basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| We had a lot of accomplishments this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| We won the sportsmanship award, and we won the Knox County Championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| It was the first time Gresham had won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| And those are great privileges and honors, and the boys really worked hard all year long to achieve those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| But it's bigger than basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| And that's the one message I think these boys will carry with them for the rest of their lives is it's bigger than basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| It's about life, and it's about the relationships that you make with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| And 20 years from now, they won't remember the wins and losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| but they're going to remember the difference they made in each other's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| And that sums up the whole season right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2579)|

| 0:43:05| Thank you again for this opportunity tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2585)|
| 0:43:15| When I tried out for basketball at Bearden Junior High School, I was sick the first day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| So I missed the first practice, and that was the one where they cut a lot of the dead weight, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| And so I made it to the second night of tryouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| and it was all the talk at Bearden Junior High School that I'd made it through the first night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| But full disclosure, I missed that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| But I will tell you, Coach, I read a quote by Billy Graham one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| and he said the most important person in a kid's life can be a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| And I appreciate what you've done for these young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| And, Sammy, I want to give you this pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| This is Knox County pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I'll give it to you, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| It's got a little stick on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Why don't we let you put it on him there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| That pen is actually made in America, like you, Sammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| So it's probably one of the few things left in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| I appreciate you, buddy, and I appreciate your stick-to-it-ness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Thank you, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2652)|
| 0:44:21| Sammy might be a little shy here today, but he's not shy on the basketball court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| Right, Sammy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| He said he didn't want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| That's the best speech of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| So, anyway, I just want to congratulate you all, and thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| Thank you, Coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2675)|

| 0:44:48| and there is a lot of good being done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=2688)|

| 0:53:03| and they truly are on the front line, and they have tough jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3183)|

| 0:53:08| We have about six organizations represented today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| and they all do different aspects of housing for the HUD program that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3191)|

| 0:53:29| We have another site on Coster that also has some veterans in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3209)|

| 0:53:39| They do multifamily housing acquisition, and they also work on single-family housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3219)|

| 0:53:47| We have CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3227)|

| 0:53:50| They do housing rehab and single-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Basically, they do new construction, but they basically acquire and rehab those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| We also have NHI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| They serve in the same capacity as NHI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| As CAC, they do rehab on housing and also single-family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| Just to give you a little profile of the individuals that are behind me here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| these are truly people with big hearts that work very hard with the least among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| I always tell people when I talk about these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| some people life doesn't happen for like other people, and they have a tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| These are good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| The people that are helping these programs, we have to verify their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| We're doing rehab on their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| We have to make sure their taxes are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| They just have a tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| They don't have money for a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| They don't have time for a septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| It doesn't perk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| So these programs help very good people that are hardworking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| And so I want to say an appreciation to all the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| and individuals behind me that are representing those agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| And just to give you a little bit of profile, I'm going to keep it very brief here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| The average median income from Knox County termed by HUD is $63.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| The program has three silos, basically, of people that we can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| It's 0 to 30 AMI average median income, and then we have 31 to 50 AMI income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| and then we have 51 to 80% of AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| And for the housing program, over 88% of the individuals served are under 50% AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| And so you can see that these programs and these agencies representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| are on the front lines helping the people that deserve the most help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| that are hardworking, good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| And so I just want to say we take this time as an opportunity to thank all these agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| all these staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3327)|
| 0:55:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Thank you for all you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| On page 2, under Drives and Roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| consideration of the closure of a portion of Twin Creek Road between Martin Millpack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| and Governor John Severa Highway on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| Okay. I think we have two gentlemen that wanted to speak in public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Good evening to the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Reverend Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| I pastored the church at 6530 Twin Creek Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| I am, too, a Doyle High graduate from years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| But I guess talking with the church and the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| and some of the neighbors on the Twin Creek next to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| we have concerns about the closure in that in 2009, in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| I came here before the committee because our church was burnt by arson in 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| and we built back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| And by closing the road, we have concerns that because we're the last building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| before you get to where the road closure is that it would create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| We have drug problems and people that come and park and back and forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| and we just felt that it would cause more problems for us as a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| because we've had our air conditioner units broke into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| One thing, it's a very isolated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| It's a quiet area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| And during the day, a lot of the people that work are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| So it creates troubles, especially for the elderly of our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| because they have to drive all the way around and get on John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| to be able to come to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| So those are some of the concerns that we have is talking to the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| I know we've had a long problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| Carson Daly knows that they dump tires, mattresses, TVs, chemicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| At one time, the chemical that was dumped, I think, years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| my dad caught me and my dad caught them and called in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| So it's just been an ongoing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| There was a fence put on Twin Creek as you drive down to try to prevent the dumping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| but they come and they'll even try to pull it down or cut it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| and continue to dump anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| But I understand it's a problem that I don't know what the answers are to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| I've thought about maybe surveillance cameras and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| I've even stopped a few people that I caught dumping as I was leaving the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| and they get mad if you say anything to them about dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| But we just wanted to let the commissioners, let you all know the concerns that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| We're willing to work with you in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| I know we're not going to solve all the problems overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| but I guess just in the closure of the road, at least when it was open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| you had the chance of people driving by that kind of made people that would park kind of suspect to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| But now that the road is closed, even the two weeks that it's been closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| we've caught people in the church driveway and they park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| We just have concerns that that would lead to other problems that we certainly don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| But I wanted to bring that to the commission and just let you know the concerns that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Yes, sir, if you would give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Julian Harris, 5652 Washington Byte, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| I'm a trustee at Harris Chapel Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| and my concerns are a lot of what our pastor just got done speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| The church burned down by arson in 2009, and that person has still never been found that did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3574)|
| 0:59:41| And I'm at our church a lot of times at night because I'm over at the kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| and I have had people, when the door wasn't locked, just walk in on me late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| It just happened back in November this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| My concern is with nobody able to drive, no reason for just regular pastor buyers to drive through anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3595)|
| 1:00:03| because it's a dead-end road, that we're going to have more vandalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| worry about them tearing up the cemetery, more likely to come in there and steal the air conditioners again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| come back in and set the church on fire again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Because, like I said, right now, if you stand out there before the road was closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| people did drive by to keep from going all the way down to John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| They would cut through there and go out that way, come through Twin Creek and come out to the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| They're just at the end of John Sevier and Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| But with the road closed, there's no reason for just everyday people to drive through there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| And so there goes your people that would drive by and see something that's not supposed to be happening happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| and call in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| And I have friends that are Knox County deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| and they have told me, they said, with that road being closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| you're going to be more susceptible to stuff like that happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| and your church is going to be more susceptible because there is no pastor buyers anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| So I'm not foreclosing the road, and our whole church is not foreclosing the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Commissioners, I'll have to have a motion on the floor before we can start discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| I've got a question, though, for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Okay. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| What is the address of the church, Pastor Harris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| 6530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Twin Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Are you saying the road's already closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Yes, it was closed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Please come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Bring up Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Bring up Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Can we get a motion before we can start having a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| I'll make a motion to approve closing on First Reading, Twin Creek Road, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Is the road already closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| It's a temporary closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| That is our standard practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| It's one of the ways that it's advertised to the public is that we'll go ahead and erect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| just basic Type I barricades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| It shows the point of closure, and then we have the signs advertising the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| and the opportunity for people to come and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| What was the reason Engineering and Public Works wants to close this road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| We have had problems for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| As Reverend Harris alluded to, dumping is probably the single biggest issue that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| Tires and litter on Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| From a transportation standpoint, it really functions more as a cut-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| The number of actual homes being served is very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| so it functions as a cut-through in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Again, we've had a number of issues with crime in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| In fact, sort of the interesting part about this discussion is because it really is driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| by these issues of dumping and littering and illegal behavior, and that's what we do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| So that's a condition that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Additionally, the facility is very narrow, so as a cut-through, it's not as effective as it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| So I think Commissioner Daley may be able to speak to that more eloquently than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| and Jim can certainly speak to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Hey, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Where is it exactly closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| I'm looking at where the church is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| This says, between Martin Mill and Governor John Severe Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| this is actually on the other side of Martin Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| So where is the closure at currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Let me let Jim speak to that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| I haven't been out there since the temporary barricades went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| It'll be just north of the church where you start up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| So if you're on Google Maps, just go north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| I'm on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| So it would be up toward Owens Road, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| So we're going to make the church the dead end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| No, the dead end, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| The dead end will be at the last address, what Jim may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| But the church is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| Then there's a house on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| There's two houses on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| And then there's a piece of property that's got an old logging road that the owner's property is where the dump's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| And Solid Waste is here, and I'd like to have Tom come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| He had a meeting with the lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| That's where the dump is, and that's where the turnaround will be at the last two driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| One would be on the left, and one would be on the right if a home was ever built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| Tom, you had a meeting with the property owner this past week, I think it was, or last Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3866)|
| 1:04:35| Yes, I'm Tom Salter, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| Could you tell us what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Yeah, I met with Ms. Moran and her husband, and we walked up Twin Creek Road and looked at the dump site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| And our staff has estimated between 2,000 and 4,000 tires are in the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3887)|
| 1:04:56| And probably maybe 15 to 20 open-top containers, 40-yard containers of other trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| And I can't speak to those issues, but it is the worst dump in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| And in the past, there was a fence put up there by my predecessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| and somebody came by with a battery-powered sawzall and cut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| And you can see the cutoff post there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| And it's the biggest dump we have in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| And she supported closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| She felt that if we could close the road and clean up the dump site, it would be best for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3931)|
| 1:05:40| And we did send out the notices, registered letters, and we got no negative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| I have no negative responses that has come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| And, y'all, if you would like to, you're more than welcome to come up and speak about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| But I personally got positive responses on the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| because of everything that's being dumped there from mattresses to chemicals to brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| You need to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Of course, roads would have to move the barricades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| We say that a picture is worth a thousand words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Not in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| You cannot explain how many tires, how many TVs, how many mattresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| how many stoves, refrigerators are down in this steep ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| You know, we call them gullies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| I call them gullies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| We tried Commissioner Brown, I believe, or Commissioner Pinkston, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| We tried building a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| And it worked until somebody took a sawzall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| put it at the bottom of the fence and just pushed the fence over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| and they started coming back and started dumping and dumping and dumping again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| And I go through there every chance I can to try to catch somebody dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| We can't catch them dumping because they're doing it nighttime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| They're doing it in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| We got 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| You know, I told Tom we ought to do a little pot to try to guess how many tires are in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| because I say over 3,000, and there are probably over 3,000 tires there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| and not counting everything else that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| I would love to see Twin Creeks stay open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Is it a shortcut for sun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| But we're not going to stop this illegal dump unless we do something there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| to put a dead-end road with a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| We'll put a streetlight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| We'll even think about putting up a surveillance camera if it's possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| So there's ways we can remedy, you know, the people that's coming up there and want to do mischief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| We will never, ever, ever stop somebody doing mischief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| They're going to go wherever there's a dark spot to do their dirty deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| That's just going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| So I'm for closing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Commissioner Brown was here last week to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| But I would suggest if the commission would like to, the Harris's and the other property owners there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4086)|
| 1:08:13| you know, let's make an appointment, and we'll go out there and we'll move the barricades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| and we'll go down there and we'll basically take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| And I'm telling you, this picture is worth a million words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Not a thousand words, but a million words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4103)|
| 1:08:34| Yes, ma'am, did you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Just give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| My name is Juanita Bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| I live at 1814 Harris Lane, which is named after the church, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4134)|
| 1:09:04| I don't want to see Twin Creek Road closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| My husband's people moved back there in 1938, and we've been back there ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4148)|
| 1:09:20| We live in a quiet little country setting except for the dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4160)|
| 1:09:30| When we use Twin Creek, it cuts out about, oh, about four miles one way and about eight miles the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4170)|
| 1:09:44| It's a shortcut for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| We go straight up Twin Creek on to Martin Mill and down into Vestal, Chapman Highway, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4187)|
| 1:09:55| But if we don't have Twin Creek, we have to go the long way around, which is very inconvenient for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4195)|
| 1:10:05| We have complained about the dump to everybody and his grandmother for the last 15, 20, 25, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4205)|
| 1:10:15| Nothing's ever been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I called the codes enforcement, and I talked with a lady named Tammy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4220)|
| 1:10:28| And she said, we'll send someone out to look at it and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4228)|
| 1:10:35| I said, that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| I'll meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| I'll meet them and talk with them that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| Just let me know when they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Okay, I never got a call back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| As far as I know, no one came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I don't know that they did or didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| There's a surveillance tower right there that the airport uses for their benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4258)|
| 1:11:13| We even see people that stop and dump in front of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| We've called in on cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| We've called in on all kinds of dumpers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| Nothing ever came of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| We stopped a truckload of fellows in there not too long ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| that decided they would come up our little road and dump fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| And they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| And it's roofing shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| It's all kinds of mattresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Nobody, nobody has 15 mattresses at the same time if they're just an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4311)|
| 1:12:02| These are businesses that are coming back in there with truckloads of tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| And it's not an individual, personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| It's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| It's a motel that would have all those mattresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| And they can take them to the city dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| And you'd be surprised there's a county dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| They'd just go a few hundred feet further across Twin Creek there on John Sevier at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| Nice big county dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| But they don't take it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| They come down the little road, and they decide to dump it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| We have to live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| I think, I think if somebody would just get enough backbone to ask for volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4367)|
| 1:12:58| I think there'd be enough people that would volunteer to clean up this dump just like they do all the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4378)|
| 1:13:07| They just recently got one in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| Volunteers cleaned it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| They got one down in West Knoxville, cleaned it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| And I think if they would just put a little effort into it, just really want to help the people that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4398)|
| 1:13:28| I think they could get that dump cleaned up, get the fence, earth surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| We've asked them to do a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| I think they just don't want to be bothered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| And I think I'm talking about you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Just don't want to be bothered with this stupid dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Let's close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Inconvenience all those poor people that don't have a choice, but everybody's got to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| But we don't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Just close that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| Just close that road and let them people suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| We've got wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| We can't even get utility water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| We got nothing out there, but they want to close the road, make it more inconvenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4458)|
| 1:14:28| It's just the people in South Knoxville, those poor old dumb idiots that don't count anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| And that's exactly what we feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| We don't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| But it's our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| We've had it since it was a dirt road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| 1938, been back there ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4488)|
| 1:14:56| And we've had this trouble just, I don't know, we don't have anybody that wants to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| Nobody wants to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| And yet we want to build up South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Chapman Highway, John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Forget these little people that live on these back roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| We want our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| We don't want it closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| It needs black topping again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| They won't even do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| They don't even dig out the drainage ditch on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| They don't keep it in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| Knox County, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| If they did, it might deter a little bit of this bad activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4541)|
| 1:15:50| Maybe these motels would take them truckloads of mattresses somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| Just close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| That's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Don't clean up the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Don't do anything to help those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| Just close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| That's your solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| It's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| We want our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| And I hope I got through to somebody, but probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| But thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| Tom, will you come back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4586)|
| 1:16:35| Estimated cleanup cost for this dump site, what would you say it might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| The only comparable we would have was we did a tire dump on Alex Bales Road about two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4601)|
| 1:16:50| and it was about $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| We think this would be less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| but it is a problem where we would have to hire a contractor to go in with heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| This is not too dangerous for volunteer cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| There's broken televisions and bottles everywhere, and this would be a heavy equipment cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4626)|
| 1:17:15| And to speak to the point of, you know, we're trying to help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| You know, we can go in and spend the $80,000 to $100,000 to clean up the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| and we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| It's got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| There's no questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| But how are we going to stop future people from throwing 3,000 more tires in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| or mattresses and bed sets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| The only way that we can see that we can do that is to make a dead-end road with a cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| with street lights, with surveillance cameras there to catch anybody that wants to come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| Dwight or Jim, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| Thank you, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| From John Sevier Highway to, well, let's say from Harris Lane all the way around to Martin Mill Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| have you all figured out how many miles that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Let me defer to Jim on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| If I could make one point to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| just as a follow-up to what the constituent said more eloquently than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| She's done a good job outlining for you the dimensions of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| and we draw some instruction from parks and recreation experience in these kinds of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| where when something has been happening for 15 or 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| at this point it's generational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| People have been doing it for so long that it's extremely difficult for us to break the habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4720)|
| 1:18:51| For instance, what Doug does with a behavioral problem at a park is his solution is to attempt to displace the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| So with some of the issues that occurred at IC King Park over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| one of the things that he did was promoted other user groups, the bicyclists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| to do the trail maintenance and actually start to use the facility in a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| and more productive and more appropriate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| It's very difficult for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| We can clean the dump up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| So if it's $100,000, we'll come to you for an appropriation and we'll clean the dump up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| That's not nearly as troublesome to me as trying to figure out what to do about 20 years of past practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| and behavior in the community, and that's a really tough space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| And I can't stand here before you and tell you that I have any great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| We do think this approach, and we certainly recognize the inconvenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| but we do think this approach over time might be one part of breaking 20 years of behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4779)|
| 1:19:46| or resetting 20 years of behavior that's gone on in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| But that is no small task, and it really is that long in duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| I just wanted to make that point because we have drawn some instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| from what Parks and Recreation has had to do with problematic behaviors at their facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| As far as the mileage questions, I'll defer to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| We haven't done those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| We can do both a mileage and a travel time estimate for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| Obviously, if you're on John Sevier Highway going east or west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| there really won't be a delay because you're going to turn in there regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| However, if you're coming southbound on Martin Mill Pike, you do have Neuber Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| and Martin Mill at the traffic signal you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| So we will do both a distance and time measurement and provide that to you this week sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4834)|
| 1:20:42| Emergency vehicles, they wouldn't enter off John Sevier Highway anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| We would have no emergency vehicles coming from Martin Mill down south Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4847)|
| 1:20:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| The road is very narrow there as you turn off, I guess, Browns Mountain at the point up there on the north end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4856)|
| 1:21:05| So I wouldn't think it would be wise for an emergency vehicle to access it from that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| just because of the width of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| A police car could, but not an ambulance or a fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Once you drive that road, we tried to fix the problem 10, 12 years ago with the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| We spent, I don't know how much money we spent there, cleaning up tires and mattresses and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| We thought building a fence with a barbed wire catch across the top would stop the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| It didn't stop the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| They just found a way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| And I truly believe that it is a habit problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4899)|
| 1:21:47| No one here, except for maybe Tom Salter and Drew, hates litter more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| I hate litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Why are you throwing mattresses out on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| when you can take them not more than a half a mile from there and dispose of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| The only thing you cannot dispose of at a convenience center is a compressor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| a refrigerator with a compressor on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| If the compressor is off, you can dispose of it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| You can dispose of carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| You can T.V.s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| Am I correct on the T.V.s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Everything can be disposed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| And why we want to throw stuff off on the side of the road and make a dump out of it is beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| So I feel your pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| I'm from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| I live on Goodman Farm Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| I cut through there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| People have heard me say this, that, yeah, we feel like we're the redheaded stepchild of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| that we don't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Well, we are getting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| And the more things that we get, we're starting to get more development on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| And that's where it grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| It's got to grow to that point of where we can get Knox Chapman to run water up through there or sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| I would dare say that if we was to check Twin Creek, which is one of the creeks running through this dump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| it feeds into Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Stock Creek feeds into Little River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| Little River feeds into Fort Loudon Lake or the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| That creek is contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| There's no doubt in my mind that creek's contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| And we don't know what it's contaminated with because we don't know what's underneath the piles of the 3,000 tires there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| So I am for the closure of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I am for spending the $80,000 to $100,000 to get it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| And let's find some way to stop this from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Yeah, Dwight, I want to encourage your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| You know, there is inexpensive equipment out there, not cameras, not vision cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| surveillance that will alert you that somebody is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| I just want to encourage you guys to think out of the box a little bit on catching these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| It's not the technology is there to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| And if we need to appropriate some money for that, you know, even just if it's a gaming camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| you can see clear as day on those things and not vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| I think we need to think outside the box a little bit on catching these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| We've been looking at it for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| That's a long time not to do anything other than build a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| And we'd like to have similar conversations with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| But, again, at the end of the day, that actually has to come into the form that can be advanced for prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| And that's a little bit outside our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| Certainly we'd want to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| But it would benefit us if we could engage with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| At least you'd get somebody to go get the money for the cleanup from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| And this is, first of all, to say that we acknowledge the concerns that the constituents in South Knoxville has brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| But my second comment is when you remediate this dumpster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| how do you secure the site once you've removed that level of tires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| Because we've put up a temporary barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| but no one has spoken of how to secure the actual dump site that people continue to throw tires and mattresses into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5101)|
| 1:25:11| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Dwight, I'm just throwing this out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| If you set a guardrail up down there high enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| and then put up cameras like they're talking about with signs there that says dumping fine is X number of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5123)|
| 1:25:32| and you catch them on the camera dumping in front of that sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| would that not be a thing that we could go after them with some sort of warrant or fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5136)|
| 1:25:43| Would that suffice the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| Because if they're going over the rail, that means they're intentionally committing that ordinance violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5146)|
| 1:25:54| And you catch it on camera, you could use that like you do speeding cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| I understand your thought on that, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| I'd be reluctant for a misapplication of guardrail outside of the standards for guardrail installation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| because then it becomes a fixed hazard in the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| And quite frankly, it's extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| It might make more sense during the period of time if the closure goes forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| for us to contract with off-duty sheriff's office for some form of intermittent or random policing of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| And then certainly we don't have a lot of expertise in the security cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| but we can look into it and maybe some extension of what we've done at the convenience centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| because we do have cameras at all of the convenience centers might be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| Also, in speaking with the pastor from the church, I did say we'd be glad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| while the facility is still public, to look at installation of lighting around the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| And it is our plan to have lighting at the end of the road where the turnaround occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| Dwight, the road is a loop road now, basically, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| And you're going to put a block in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| What size section is it going to be taken out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Or is it just going to dead end on both sides at the same point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Jim has been handling that, Mr. Chairman, so let me defer to him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| It's probably, I'm going to say 800,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| We will only have to create a turnaround on one end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| because the other intersection itself will be eliminated at Martinville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Essentially, our proposal is to install a guardrail along that whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| because there's dumping that actually occurs off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| there's kind of a wide shoulder there adjacent to the intersection at Martinville at Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| They're dumping there as well, so we're planning on instilling a guardrail along that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| and then a turnaround about 800 feet to the south of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| What will stop people from just coming to the turnaround and dumping there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| if you have a dumping problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| That is one of our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| That's what Dwight was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| We're going to construct a proper turnaround as well as install some lighting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| There's one driveway past that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| A gentleman most likely will probably install a gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| I think Tom spoke to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| But at the location, if they were to dump there, at least it is easier for us to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| I hate to say that, but that's part of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| It would be a level area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| Right now they're dumping off a bank that is very hard to traverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| Could we try the lighting before we go to this trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| to see if the lighting itself and some cameras will suppress the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| That's an option, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| We're open to suggestion, obviously, but there are not easy answers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| They're in short supply, and there will be a cost of some variety, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| no matter how we approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| If we can confine the dumping, even if it's confined to the cul-de-sac bulb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| and not off the right-of-way, our costs are mediated or reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| The other thing, quite frankly, is if somebody is dumping and somebody calls 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| the likelihood at that point the person, whoever is there with a little bit of luck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| might be trapped when the sheriff's office can get there and not able to go out the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| If the will of the commission is to defer this, we're comfortable with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| but I can't tell you that I think we're going to come back to you with a host of better ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| because a problem that's been around for 20 years is not going to be easily corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| Again, I think when I look at all the interim solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| the core issue is that people have been doing this for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| and so we want to deny them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| I think the best way to deny them that opportunity is to close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| This dates myself very much, but we used to have that same situation over on Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| down from the steel supply and Tucker Steel area right around the railroad tracks to the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| back when I was a child, which was in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| It was constantly dumping and dumping, and finally there was a fence put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| and they still dumped inside, but now we don't have that issue because it soon caught on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5424)|
| 1:30:31| So that's what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| I feel for the church there and the residents in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5433)|
| 1:30:39| We are here to represent you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| and it's very heartfelt of how you all are going to be affected by having to go around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5443)|
| 1:30:53| and some of you have to be on John Sevier or Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| or some of those more dangerous roads that you wouldn't otherwise have to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| So I'm like Commissioner Smith and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| if we could put up, if there was a way of being able to put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| it is going to cost money either way, like we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| but it is a hazard and something needs to be taken up for the safety of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| I am concerned about it being a dead end there for people to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| We've got some dead ends and cul-de-sacs in some of our subdivisions in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| and we have nothing but trouble from them, from where people come and park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| and there's also been drug activities and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| and these are subdivisions that are, you know, close in to the city and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5504)|
| 1:31:52| So we've got that issue, so I can only imagine, you know, even further out in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| I'm just thinking that if we were able to have some Knox County Sheriff officers to sit out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5518)|
| 1:32:06| we were able to put up some cameras, you know, and no trespassing signs and catch somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5526)|
| 1:32:14| apparently it must be the same old same ones that's been doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| since it's the same items being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| I would like, before we go about just closing a road, to try these other, you know, suggestions to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5544)|
| 1:32:36| and maybe, you know, after a few months, and they think they may be caught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| and I think we ought to have a big-time penalty there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| maybe, you know, the news travels fast if they think they're going to be caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| So that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| Commissioner, can I say something before I recognize you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| I just hate to see citizens inconvenienced whenever the real problem is the bad habits of others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| and the lack of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| I believe the fine for littering is $50, so all it is is $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| I'd love to see it $5,000, but that's not going to happen, because that's a state issue to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| Can I ask you something about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| You know, $50 is, if I throw this out the window, is it also if I dump 20 squares of used shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5601)|
| 1:33:29| Yeah, it's $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| That's something that needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| I'm trying to work on that, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| I think, you know, I'm not going to put the roads in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| because I think before next month we need to go out there and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| I was talking to Pastor Harris and Julian, Mr. Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| If something happens and that road slides, we're not going to fix that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| That road is on the side of a steep side of a slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| So one of these days, if it slides, now you've got, if you go down the road maybe 400 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| it is so narrow you can't pass on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Two cars cannot pass on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| So I would love to see us meet with the citizens and the commission, go out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5660)|
| 1:34:27| try to set up a date and look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| I'm all for cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| We'd love to have cameras there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| But if they get caught, it's a $50 fine is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| Mr. Carino.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Also, do you think there's a problem because with our Knox County convenience centers and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5681)|
| 1:34:48| you're limited as to how much you can take out there at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| So do we think that that's a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| I mean, I don't know if you're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Somebody's got five box springs of mattresses and they want to get rid of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| They can't do that in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| So is there some things that you think would work if we changed some of our what's allowed or any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| I would absolutely discourage that, Commissioner Carringer, because what that's going to do is it's going to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| Remember that you operate these convenience centers for your individual constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| Those entities that are commercial in nature and that operate businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| whether they're motels or moving companies or anybody else, need to use a commercial landfill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| pay the appropriate tipping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Otherwise, all we'll be doing is subsidizing them with the operation of the convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| So I'd strongly discourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| And let me say also, we're not averse to taking another look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| and we'll work closely with Commissioner Daley and with the constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| but we are going to have an $80,000 to $100,000 expense to correct this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| and we're going to have that either way, whether this closure goes forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| So that's a known quantity that we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| So I think the first time where you are and where we are is a reasonable place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| but if we are back here in a year and a half or two or three years asking for another $100,000 to clean it up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5772)|
| 1:36:20| then I think it is going to merit a long, hard look at how much it makes sense to spend that kind of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| that's been paid by other taxpayers to avoid the circumstance that genuinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| and legitimately does inconvenience the number of constituents that are on Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| So the first time, clearly we have the expense, we know we're going to, and that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| When was the last time it was cleaned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| I'd have to ask Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| We've been out there repeatedly on tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| but I don't know if we've undertaken sort of a major cleanup with cutting roads and heavy equipment yet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| In the past, we had litter crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| Something else Commissioner Daly tried to help us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| That's why I asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| You said if we're back here again in this position next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| I'd find it kind of astonishing that you could get that much back in there within a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| and not be able to catch anybody doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| To semi-answer your question, 2007, Tom, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| 2008 or 2009, we spent tens of thousands of dollars to clean it up, and that's where the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| that's where this commission approved the fence, and the fence did not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| That was just before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| When we get a call, either our litter crew responds or highway maintenance responds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| we clean up litter and items that are actually in the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| If you've been to the site, cleaning up is not a hand operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5859)|
| 1:37:45| You can't even walk up and down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| If there was nothing there, you couldn't walk up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| So we have not engaged in a major cleanup of this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| and I would not recommend it unless there was a change in the way we're looking at this as a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| This is a major crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| It's going to cost the taxpayers $80,000 to $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| So this is criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| I would not recommend, and Dwight can pinch me if I get out of my lane here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| but even with cameras, if you get a vehicle tag, all the person has to say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| I wasn't in the vehicle, unless you get a good look at their face and can associate it with the tag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| and then we have to go forward with that, and we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| We have to take what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| And you know stuff from a security camera, it's not like CSI on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| If it's blurry, that's all you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Well, I was just getting a microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Well, I mean, I don't think we're beating a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| We're actually just talking about the road right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| But I'll tell you what, in 12 years that we've talked about this dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| and no enforcement action period has taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| I don't think that you can say that this won't work or that won't work because nobody's tried anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| Nobody's been there past 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| And so, I mean, I haven't been down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| I thought it was a, when I saw it on the agenda, I thought it made sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| because I'd heard Mike Brown talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| So, I mean, it may still make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| And I'll probably vote yes today just so we can move on to the next month because it has two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| But if we're not doing anything to try to do enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| I don't think we need to talk about enforcement on this issue right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| We've made no effort, zero, as a county other than offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| Commissioner, for clarification, we manage the solid waste stream of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5986)|

| 1:39:53| I'm talking about dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| I'm talking about complaint dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| And there's nothing been done on this site other than saying we can't do anything but close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Again, I'd want the commission to know we're not the litter police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| We have limited authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Ours are civilian employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| We are not armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Our ability to prosecute these things in Sessions Court has been very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| It's been difficult to find support there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| So, this is a, when it's on this scale, this really is a law enforcement matter, and it exceeds our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| Is littering in the code, would your codes officers not be able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| Yes, sir, they can, but I will tell you that we've found limited support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| For instance, American Freight out in the west end, Commissioner Schoonmaker's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6034)|
| 1:40:42| has had problems with a lot of debris and littering off of their dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| We have, I thought, built a very successful case there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| We had trouble getting anybody in the district attorney's office to take an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| In all fairness to them, I recognize they're busier with other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| but we're driven by constituent complaints about constant litter around the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| and that's what we act on, but it starts to get outside our lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| when we start talking about a lot of surveillance and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| and that's a place we probably need to reach out to the sheriff's office and see if we can find some support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6069)|
| 1:41:17| Okay. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| Give your name and address for the record, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| All right. My name's Darrell Bright. I live at 1814 Harris Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| I was just going to say a couple of quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| They're talking about when they put the fence up that they cleaned the dump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| and somebody had cut the fence down with a sawzall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| No, a tree fell on the fence, and then somebody come and cut the rest of it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| just to make it convenient for them to dump, and everything that's in this dump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| you go right across the street to the county dump, and they won't take mattresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| They won't take tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| That's why this is all down the bank out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| And them talking about cleaning it up before, there is wooden-rimmed Model T tires down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6123)|
| 1:42:11| So how long do you think it's been since it's been cleaned up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| So I don't know what they're talking about that they've cleaned it up before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| because there's been no effort whatsoever to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| And essentially what they're wanting to do is we'd rather close the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| than clean your house dump that you've been reporting for 50 or 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| That's all I've got to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| Okay. We have a motion to approve and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| This is just the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| I would encourage everybody to go out and look at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Commissioner, I'll be happy to run out there and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| It is blocked off, so we would have to sit with Dwight to move the barricades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| I can't walk around them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| You can walk around them? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Mr. Chairman, if you'd like, we'd be glad to have Tom and really Jim, and I'll come out there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| and they can speak to some of the logistics of the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| And again, just so the constituent understands, regardless of what happens here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| cleaning up the site is something that's going to have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| Again, our concern is that when you have 20, 30, 40 years of established practice of public behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6205)|
| 1:43:34| it is extremely hard to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| But we'd be glad if maybe through the commission office set up some sort of site visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| we'd be glad to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=6224)|

| 2:00:38| which some of you may know Mr. John Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| He is providing a total of $252,977.38 towards the project, which, as Commissioner Schoonmaker indicated, is a little over 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7242)|
| 2:00:53| His apartments that are adjoining Emery Church Road, as part of the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7253)|
| 2:01:02| he is 100% responsible for the turn lane addition or lengthening on Eastbound Westland Drive traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7262)|
| 2:01:11| and then he is 50% responsible for the turn lane lengthening on Emery Church Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| and 50% responsible for the traffic signal installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| So, if approved, this contract will allow us to do work along Emery Church Road as well as Westland Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7282)|
| 2:01:32| and install a traffic signal and have all that work completed by the time school starts in August of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7292)|
| 2:01:41| And this is a great bonus for this area of town because this intersection is really tough for those parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7301)|
| 2:01:49| who are trying to get their children in the morning to A.L. Lotz Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| as well as that traffic that's trying to get onto Westland Drive to access Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| So, this is an awesome opportunity, and hopefully we can get it done, like you said, before school starts in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| So, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7327)|

| 2:04:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| Do we have any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| This is sort of an aside, but I believe that while I was away this last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| I received an invitation to attend something that we're probably paying $100 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| But it said the fair market value of the meal being received was $41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| Now, if we had received that comped, we couldn't have received that ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7507)|
| 2:05:14| But since we're paying the $100, that means the taxable contribution that we're giving is $100 minus 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7514)|
| 2:05:24| So you do see there is a difference between our rule of whatever we got, $35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7524)|
| 2:05:33| and the state limited guideline, which is $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| So I again affirm my support for the fact that we follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7537)|
| 2:05:43| I'm curious where that $41 meal is served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| I will try to bring that next month because I have a huge stack of stuff I'm trying to catch up from this past month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7548)|
| 2:05:56| But there is something that we received during the month that said it was fair market value was $41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7556)|
| 2:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| Well, I'll just be really brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| As I chimed in earlier when this first came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| my concern was that it would be perceived as just that we were giving ourselves a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| And I get it that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| But that was my main concern with this was that it could have created that perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| It was reported as taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| It was reported as what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| Taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7596)|

| 2:06:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7599)|

| 2:07:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| I'm going to give Dwight Vanderbate all the credit for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| Him and I have been in a lot of discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| And there was something before my time that was called the commissioner's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7641)|

| 2:07:30| And Dwight said this is a great time for them and any department to come before us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| hey, we're going to have this road in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7655)|

| 2:07:38| The health department may say, well, the flu's coming up or you need to start looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| So my suggestion, we talked, Dwight and I have spoken about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| and the best time for that would be to happen would be the workshop at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| If we, you know, we can have a, we can call it the chairman's get-together, whatever we want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| Bruncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7677)|

| 2:07:59| Bruncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| Bruncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| That'll work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| So my suggestion is that we look at, have Drew look at, see if we can schedule that 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| if everybody's willing, that we can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| When we see Dwight, Joe, Jim, your name's changed to Joe, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7694)|
| 2:08:21| Doug Battelle, when we see him coming through that door over there, we all run to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| because we've got questions to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| So this would be a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| So my suggestion is that we look at doing a 4 o'clock workshop, informational meeting, chairman's brunch or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7708)|
| 2:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| Anybody else want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7720)|
| 2:08:47| Of course, we have to get Drew to see if the room's available every time, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| Well, I'd appreciate some feedback from my colleagues on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| We're talking about brunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| No, you're talking about lupper because that's between lunch and supper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| So you're talking about every work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| Brunch is on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| Yeah, this is before the work sessions where the departments can come and talk to us one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| or as a group in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| There's no food to be served or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| It's just an informational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| It's optional, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| So would this be us getting here a little early to just basically visit with the departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| before the official work session happens and try to schedule it so that we've got a little bit of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| not necessarily teeth, but know when we're going to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| Well, how did it work before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| Are you going to explain how it worked before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| You asked for input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| Finance committee meeting once a quarter has been being at 4 o'clock on work session day, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7789)|
| 2:09:58| And then some work session days have been audit committee meeting at like 1 o'clock or 1.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7798)|
| 2:10:07| which might run to 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| I believe that can be worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| It would mean, though, maybe not having one every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7813)|
| 2:10:20| And to be honest, there's not every month that a department has something to bring to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| But I think it is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| You know, whenever we used to have the chairman lunch, and I was on a few of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| so was Bob, Ed, Brad, and yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| it was a time we sat down and the departments brought things that weren't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| in fact, they were never hardly ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| I don't think any of them were ever on something that was going to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| It was typically a direction or something down the road that they were moving towards in an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7846)|
| 2:10:53| So continuing, we know that we have something every commission meeting day at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7853)|
| 2:11:00| That's the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| By the same sign, we would know that every work session day we have something at 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| and it would be at the discretion of the chair for what that meeting might be called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| It could be called the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| It could be called the lumper or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| But we know that every work session day we're going to have something at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| Discussion regarding grand jury report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| That's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7901)|
| 2:11:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7914)|
| 2:11:55| We had a report that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| We had a report that came from the grand jury talking about our detention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7919)|
| 2:12:04| our youth detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| Yes, Richard Bean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| And it was telling us what their reports are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| And when I was on the grand jury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| I was impressed when I got to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| I got to travel different areas in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| And we did a report on each section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| And not everybody got a browsing report from the grand jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7950)|
| 2:12:39| I just thought it would be funny to, not funny, but serious enough to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7959)|
| 2:12:46| when they got the report, did you all get a copy of the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7970)|
| 2:12:51| The last item on the report read this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| It says, after telling everything, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| moreover, the grand jury was very impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| and proud of what they witnessed while they were on Mr. Bean's tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| And I think people like that that have run a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| and how they treat the individuals there with respect and honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| I think they needed to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| I wish Mr. Bean could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| But, you know, I had to report his grand jury findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| So I really thank you, if you're listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| Thank you very much for your service and what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| and how you make the county look with this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| Discussion regarding scheduling a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| between the Chamber of Commerce Entrepreneur Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| and the Knox County Commission for an overview of the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| Recently, I think it was after lunch downtown a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| I ran into Jim Biggs, who is the director of the Knoxville Entrepreneur Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| They had recently hosted a city council for a session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| with some of their businesses that were being started up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| I spoke to him about it and asked him if he could host a similar event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| for Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| They have multiple programs there that help businesses start in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| Some, they help them with getting investment, kind of seed capital, angel capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| Some, they help businesses when they're in the startup mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| They have one particular program for some of their most successful businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| that they're still working with called GrowthWorks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| About once a month, they have a luncheon with the 10 to 12 businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| that are in the growth stage in this GrowthWorks program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| They wanted to invite us to join those businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| sort of small to mid-sized businesses that are still starting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| and in the growth phase to talk to them about the business environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| and, frankly, create some two-way feedback for them to give us advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| on what type of environment seems to work for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| and for us to just sort of learn from them and them to learn from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| So that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| What they suggested is we could do a lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| and I figured that a lunch in June might be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| because we'd be through our budget season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| and it could probably be arranged on either a work session Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| or a county commission Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| So I could throw that back at you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| and if there's one particular date in June or, frankly, another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8124)|
| 2:15:27| that we're far enough out that we can schedule this with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| that might work best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| And, you know, obviously it will be not mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| but whatever would work for anybody who'd like to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8135)|
| 2:15:40| Is there any take on which particular Monday in June might work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8140)|
| 2:15:47| Hugh, are you talking about lunchtime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Yes, lunchtime, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| I'm open to either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| Are you wanting to do, like, some day of workshops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| Well, I was, frankly, thinking of a day of either a workshop or a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| because we're all going to be down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| I think the 18th might be a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| That could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| And the 25th is our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| And we have retirement and pension board at 1.30 on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| In June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| So what might be best, frankly speaking, for the retirement team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| at 1.30, that's not quite a quick turn that can still be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| but we may want to go at the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| That way we're not rushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| Would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| With your all's permission, I will reach out to Jim and set it up for the 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| assuming that that date works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| Nothing's changed and that date works for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| and we'll send out through the commission office invitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| It'll be a lunch meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8220)|
| 2:17:06| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| Discussion regarding conference and travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| I was wanting to get an idea of who all's planning on going to the TCSA conference in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8234)|
| 2:17:24| I believe it's in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| We've got one, two, three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| What dates are you all planning on being there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| It starts on Tuesday, the 22nd, that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| So everybody's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| I think I looked at the schedule, and the first meetings are at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8269)|
| 2:17:56| Is everybody planning to go up that morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| Have you guys taken the time to look at our travel budget this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| Is this going to be the last conference that we attend in this budget cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8288)|
| 2:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| Has everybody looked at what they've spent on traveling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Anybody have an idea of what they've spent on travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| I don't even know where you go look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| And, number one, I don't even know what the travel budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| because we were never informed what the travel budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| The travel budget is $15,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| And you can go by the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| I keep the records there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| Commissioner Goodman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| Well, the travel budget for Knox County for the first six months of this year was $487,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8323)|
| 2:18:50| And we show that we have our office spends .75 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8330)|
| 2:18:56| or less than 1 percent of the county's travel budget for the first six months of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| According to the records that are filed by the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| We can probably make up a smaller fraction of the total number of people, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| My question is not about the travel budget but about the conference itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| The expense to attend, we have to register whether we have travel expense or spend the night or do anything, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8359)|
| 2:19:29| Yes, I think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| Or it's $100 or it's whatever it is per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8370)|
| 2:19:39| And it doesn't matter if you just go for the first day or for the first two days, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| I would like to register to go just to attend the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| but that's the only thing I want to expense, the expense of attending the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| And I will only be able to be there the Tuesday and Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| You don't spend the night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| Because what I'm trying to do is figure out how many hotel rooms we need to get Drew to reserve and for what night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8404)|
| 2:20:11| So we need five for two nights, Tuesday and Wednesday night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8411)|
| 2:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| Is that everything we have, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| No, we've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Discussion of TriStar and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| That would be my idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| Let me, the Senate House Bill came in this year, February 8, 2018, House Bill number 1748, Senate Bill number 1786.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8437)|
| 2:20:52| And in there they were talking about a registered trademark or level that they could promote the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8452)|
| 2:21:02| I sent in each one of you, you have one of these little papers that was given to you that has the TriStar emblem on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8462)|
| 2:21:13| We have been working on this quite some time through the Chamber of Commerce, not the Chamber, but the Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8473)|
| 2:21:22| Kim and Chad down at the Visit Knoxville office down there with Mark Brown, the pro at the Three Ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8482)|
| 2:21:31| to get something to bring notoriety back into the Three Ridges golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| But it is a good trademark that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| This right here, if you look at it, it's a very in-depth tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| It is registered to us here in Knoxville through the Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8504)|
| 2:21:51| It cannot be taken away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| It is registered here under this trademark and under the guidelines of what we have on the tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| You'll notice it is a three-day tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| This year it will be in July the 6th through the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8521)|
| 2:22:07| There will be entry fees and then some other things to encourage pros to bring their teams here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8527)|
| 2:22:14| There's also going to be some prize money given out to the pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| We have had quite a few hits on this so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| The pro will bring in five, four of their junior players to play to help qualify for the last day of the tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8542)|
| 2:22:31| for the pros themselves for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| That means they'll be spending three days in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| and we're not sure exactly how much that we could bring in for tax revenue for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8557)|
| 2:22:44| But it seems like it could be a great thing going on by the number of hits we've already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| And we just announced this publicly this past Friday that we put it out on the TGA website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8569)|
| 2:22:57| And again, this is a statewide tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| And we'll bring in college coaches to take a look at these juniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| And there's hotels going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| And we're probably going to use the Crown Plaza as the final day to award prizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| and honor teams that have won in this tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| So we beat the state on the emblem to get registered right here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8598)|
| 2:23:25| So we need to say thanks to Chad at Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| and also Mark Brown for leading the charge of getting the PGA and the TGA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8610)|
| 2:23:38| giving us an endorsement to have this tournament here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| So there's things out there that can generate and we could use it as part of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| to kind of just beat ourselves on the back and say we're a great area to be into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| So anyway, that was my thing about talking about the TriStar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| Okay. Are there any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| Commissioner Bussard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8645)|
| 2:24:12| Well, one of the announcements that I was going to make, too, is that please put these dates down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8652)|
| 2:24:19| The tournament starts, as you see here, at 8 a.m. in the morning for those three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| Also, on the 11th of next month is another Honor Air flight out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8663)|
| 2:24:31| Need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| If you've never been to one, you need to go there and see what's going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| and the veterans that will be taking that flight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| And that was my two announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8680)|
| 2:24:46| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| This Thursday at 11 o'clock we're going to once again hold the monthly Knox County Schools Bus Driver Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| It's 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| It's going to be at the Ted Russell Ford on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| The Whites have been generous enough to sponsor this and give each one of these deserving bus drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8699)|
| 2:25:06| there's five of them, a $100 check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| And so they're well-deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| If you can come by for just the last 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| It's been sunshine and we'd love to have you this Thursday, 11 o'clock, Ted Russell Ford, Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| So this is the first time that they've done it there then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| He wanted to change it up this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| That's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| Two, real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8729)|
| 2:25:30| April 7th is Iams River cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| Come to Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| You can help me or go to Iams Nature Center and sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| There's like 28 different sites to be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8739)|
| 2:25:43| And also April 17th is the Knoxville Soup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| You can go to the KnoxvilleSoup.org and get some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| I know Commissioner Thomas has served on the Dogwood Arts Bowl Board, so he's probably quite familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| But the ribbon cutting for the featured Dogwood Trail is going to be on this Thursday, the 29th, at 11 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8759)|
| 2:26:08| at the Westmoreland Waterwheel that will be followed by the Dogwood Luncheon over at Lakeshore Park thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8768)|
| 2:26:20| So I know if you can make it, I would love to see you at the ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| Any further announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| Okay, we're pushed right up against zoning, so I'm going to call for zoning to start at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8790)|
| 2:26:38| You can't take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8800)|
| 2:26:50| We're going to adjourn and then we'll reconvene for zoning at 7.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8810)|
| 2:27:03| I thought you were going to call the roll and then take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8823)|
| 2:27:23| Madam Clerk, will you call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8843)|

| 2:27:48| All members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| Madam Clerk, will you read the first item, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| 2-A-18-SP is the request of Knox County Commission for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8873)|
| 2:28:00| from TP Technology Park to GC General Commercial Property located southeast side of Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8880)|
| 2:28:07| west side of Thompson Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8887)|
| 2:28:11| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8891)|
| 2:28:18| I'm Benny Moorman, 10308 Hardin Valley Road in Knoxville, Tennessee, representing the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8898)|
| 2:28:25| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| Can we get the report of the MPC staff from Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, this is the second time this request has come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8913)|
| 2:28:41| Originally, I recommended for denial or change to office overlay as opposed to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8921)|
| 2:28:51| The Commission sent it back to the Planning Commission for additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| The Planning Commission once again voted 14-0 to recommend a sector plan change to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| as opposed to the general commercial, general business requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8942)|
| 2:29:09| Does the applicant wish to speak to the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| I have very little more to add than to tell you that we have followed the direction of this body from a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8953)|
| 2:29:21| We did go before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| We've also got a positive ruling from the Tennessee Technology Corridor for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8962)|
| 2:29:33| The arguments that I've heard was that this would be more suited for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| As a result of that, I've done a little bit of research in office in the area and the uses in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8977)|
| 2:29:43| and within one mile of this property, at least professional use offices, there exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| within approximately one mile, three veterinary offices, three dentists, two orthodontists, six medical offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8989)|
| 2:29:57| seven engineering offices, two land surveying offices, two physical therapy offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| The only professional services that I really didn't see a concentrated use in the area would have been for accounting services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9002)|
| 2:30:09| and legal services, and I'm not sure Hardin Valley is ready for that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| I think it could come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| But being a resident in the Hardin Valley area, my office being just down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| I can assure you there is a grand need for more commercial and uses therewith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9020)|
| 2:30:28| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Yeah, to refresh my memory, Gerald, or either one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9031)|
| 2:30:36| why is the general commercial not acceptable to the MPC staff or the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9036)|
| 2:30:45| Yeah, there were two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| One, that the commercial was actually more appropriate on the other side of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9048)|
| 2:30:56| This would introduce commercial on the west side of Thompson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| in an area where there's no commercial at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| There's vacant commercial, undeveloped commercial on the east side of Thompson, of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| Felt that given the undeveloped commercial areas, commercial zoning in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9070)|
| 2:31:17| that additional commercial zoning may not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| This would also make a better transition and less impact on the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9080)|
| 2:31:29| If I could add, it's my client and my position that the property on the east side of Thompson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9089)|
| 2:31:35| while zone CA, the large reason that it's not been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9095)|
| 2:31:39| is it has severe topographic constraints where this property does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| As I previously mentioned, and I won't rehash that, this property lays very well for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| Also, as far as separation from the adjoiner, the closest residence to our property is 240 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9109)|
| 2:31:59| What is the suggested, or what's the requested use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| Is there a use that you have in mind, or are you just going for the GC to find a use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| Well, they own a restaurant, the sushi spot up in Hiles area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| and they are considering locating another establishment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| That's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| They're not committed to that, but with an office zoning, that would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| them as the property owner, that would not be a viable option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| Is this the house that used to have the lawnmowers and everything at the top of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| However, the ownership has changed since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Right. It's the same house, so it's kind of a brick house with a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| and you had lawnmower sales and repair up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| Just thinking about this, it says we think that this would be better for office than commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9169)|
| 2:32:59| but we have so much commercial around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| Why wouldn't it be acceptable, Mr. Green, to say go ahead with commercial on that side of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9183)|
| 2:33:11| It seems like we're trying to engineer certain businesses in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| and I'm not sure that we can direct business that is not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9196)|
| 2:33:27| Well, not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| It could be suitable for that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| and just wondered why the thought pattern was more office than commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| because it's easier for them to develop in a commercial business that would suit the community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9217)|
| 2:33:44| For better or worse, zoning does attempt to establish a land use pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| and the final decision is with this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| The feeling of the staff was that the office use would have less impact on adjacent residential than a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9231)|
| 2:34:00| Within this, we can't limit the hours of operation, the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| There are a number of standards that are impacts commercial development would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| that would be adverse to the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| We're trying to manage the impacts, whether it's traffic, light, noise, or other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9252)|
| 2:34:18| and protect the residential uses there while allowing what we feel is a reasonable level of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9258)|
| 2:34:24| which would be provided by the office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| And, again, it's looking into the future and trying to anticipate what is the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| and we'd look at the sector plan, which was developed with the input of the people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| and use that as the guide, and the zoning proposed does require sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| That makes us look even more closely at the potential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9286)|
| 2:34:50| because the community, as part of the sector planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| has identified this as a place that's not, at this time, appropriate for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9294)|
| 2:35:01| And, sir, how far away was the, you said, residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9301)|
| 2:35:07| The residential home is 240 feet from the common property line of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| The actual residence is 240 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| I would also share with you the development of this parcel would result in a retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9314)|
| 2:35:20| on the rear of the property that would serve as a buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| along with there is adequate property in the configuration to put in a vegetative buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9324)|
| 2:35:29| and I don't think that would be an issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| I find it interesting that we're talking about this property is now suitable for office but not commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9332)|
| 2:35:40| My office is located less than a quarter of a mile down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| I was before this body in 2000 trying to get it zoned office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| and I had been denied by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9348)|
| 2:35:54| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| And, Mr. Green, two quick questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| If this did not go up against Thompson Road there, would this still be an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| Do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9368)|
| 2:36:09| I think so, given the sector plan designation, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| Do you think it still would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9373)|
| 2:36:21| I don't think that's the main question I really had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| And if this was commercial, then you might have an entrance and exit there on Thompson Road as well, wouldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9384)|
| 2:36:31| I think it's highly probable there would be an entrance on Thompson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| but you have roughly 200 or 300 feet of road frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9395)|
| 2:36:42| and that access would be far away from the intersection to allow for proper stack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| and it's about 340 feet of road frontage on Thompson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| Right. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9411)|
| 2:36:53| I don't see that being a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9415)|
| 2:37:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| And this may go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| I guess we're a little bit talking about the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| So if it's approved for general commercial, it's just such a wide open zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9427)|
| 2:37:13| and I want to get you what you want to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| but also it's just a wide open zoning that you can put almost anything there that's detrimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| Is it within the technology overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| So it's already went through TCCDA as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9442)|
| 2:37:28| Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| General commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| Well, that's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9455)|
| 2:37:38| Would you be required to upgrade Thompson Road if you put an outlet there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| Is that anything that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9462)|
| 2:37:44| I'm not sure of that, and in that particular area, Thompson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| I know Thompson Road is substandard as you go closer towards Level Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| But in this vicinity, Thompson Road, because of the interchange that was built right there on Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| it's in pretty strong shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| But, you know, the development of a commercial track would be beneficial of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9479)|
| 2:38:07| that you had the best access available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| and I don't think anybody that was looking to develop this parcel as a general commercial track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| would take issue if Thompson Road needed to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| Are you the developer or are you the architect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| I am a land surveyor just down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| I'm going to make the motion to approve GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| I just don't, I'm not compelled that the MPC is, what I hear is we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9514)|
| 2:38:41| I don't know that there's any backing to that feeling other than they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| So I'm going to make the motion for approval on GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| I serve on the TTCDA, and we approved the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| and had long discussions in looking at the area on the technology overload,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9538)|
| 2:39:04| and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| You know, that part of Hardin Valley Road is just, it's going to be commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| and you can call it what you want, but it's going to be commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| so we might as well just go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| Well, what gives me comfort is the design standards within the TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| so it's got to be, it's a little bit more strict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| and the only thing I worry about is Thompson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| but you'll have to work with engineering on that to get approval on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| Commissioner Scowmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9572)|
| 2:39:33| Mr. Green, was the staff and the MPC commissioners reluctant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9573)|
| 2:39:38| because it's only a two-acre track of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| thinking that this is potentially going to be a Hardee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| or something of that venue if it was full commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| Not specifically a Hardee's, a full commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| It was going back to what Commissioner Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| that in that general commercial and that zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| there are a number of uses that could be developed without any review or oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| other than that sometimes minimal provided by the TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| just not being able to better address the proposed uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| the impacts on the neighbor, even though the neighboring home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9611)|
| 2:40:16| existing home is 240 feet away, that property surrounding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| could develop for more intense residential than we'd be hearing from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| even though the commercial was there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| The impacts, the potential traffic at that intersection at Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| impact on Thompson Road and on Hardee Valley Road at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| I think it was more the lack of control within the zoning than the zoning itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9636)|
| 2:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| Okay, do we have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| Okay, we have a motion and a second before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9651)|
| 2:40:59| Approving general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9659)|

| 2:41:48| Can we get the report from the MPC staff and Director Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9712)|
| 2:41:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| The Planning Commission voted 14-0 to recommend office zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| as opposed to the commercial zoning for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| They felt that the office uses would be more compatible with the adjacent residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9722)|
| 2:42:10| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9730)|
| 2:42:13| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| Mr. Chairman, once again, this is right on Hardee Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| and that's what Hardee Valley Road is turned into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| I would vote for the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9744)|

| 2:42:40| CA to TO Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9760)|
| 2:42:46| Yes, it would be CA General Business with the TO Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9766)|
| 2:42:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9772)|
| 2:42:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180326?start=9773)|
