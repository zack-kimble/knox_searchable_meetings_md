| 0:02:21| that we needed to do, and we're finishing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Is this money related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=144)|

| 0:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| I've been discussing with several different administrative departments in 12A, the corridor overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| I'd like to ask for a 90-day postponement of that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=174)|

| 0:03:11| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| I postponed something involving Metropolitan Planning Commission some time ago, and it got it outside the range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| and I don't want that to happen this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| Yeah, we looked at that timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| This is not going to put this outside the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| We had 60 to 90 days as an option to keep it within range, and so we selected 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| We just need to review this a little bit further internally with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| Okay, we have a motion and a second to postpone 12A for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| That is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Consent items are 11R, which is Certificate of Compliance, and 12R through T, which are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=230)|
| 0:03:59| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| The ayes have it, and that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| The mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| First, I want to welcome Troop 1882 from the Sequoia District, from United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| That would be South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| And Kimberlin Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| What does that say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Oh, the Sequoia District is the Boy Scouts District, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| I believe you all have somebody who's going to come down and introduce yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=271)|

| 0:04:38| And maybe all of your other Boy Scouts could stand up so we can see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=285)|

| 0:04:48| What address do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| You don't need to do your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| So just tell us about we won't have young people give their address here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| Go right ahead and tell us something about your troop and why you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=299)|

| 0:05:58| As you all know, council approved design funding for this project as part of our Magnolia Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| The project will eventually redesign the Magnolia Streetscape from Holothane Drive all the way out to Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=364)|
| 0:06:12| What you're going to see tomorrow are some model blocks that really stretch from Jessamine to Bertrand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=372)|
| 0:06:21| And I've actually had a preview on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| They're pretty exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| So I encourage everybody to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| We have an engineering design consultant, Kim Lee Horn and Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| and they will discuss both short- and long-term improvements to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| And, of course, Dawn Michelle Foster from our Office of Redevelopment is heading up that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Again, that is tomorrow night, April 16th at 5.30 p.m. at John T. O'Connor Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| Also next week is National Community Development Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=408)|

| 0:07:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=423)|

| 0:07:15| And so the theme is 40 years of building strong communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| We have events all week long, and I'd just like to highlight a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| We'll start the week off Monday with an open house on Bishop Street, 3425 and 3435 Bishop Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=444)|

| 0:07:42| Those houses are constructed by the East Tennessee Housing Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=462)|

| 0:07:58| The house at 3444 Compton Street will be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| and that's a chance for the neighbors in that area to get together, to get to know each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=483)|

| 0:09:47| This is a great opportunity to highlight all the great neighborhood and community development projects that we do across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| We're looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Also next week, we have another public meeting, and that is to talk about plans for the 700 block of South Gave Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=596)|
| 0:10:05| That's the section between Church and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| That meeting is Tuesday, April 22nd at 5.30 p.m. at the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| And this is one of the capital projects that we just added as part of the budget amendment recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| This is for streetscape work to help fit in with some of the other streetscape that's been done on Gave Street already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=621)|
| 0:10:31| So if you want to learn more about those plans and the construction schedule, this will be a good chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| And we are assured that Gave Street will not be under construction during our spring festivals next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=636)|
| 0:10:46| I can guarantee you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| Which, by the way, was pretty great over this past weekend with the Rossini Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| I know a lot of you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=653)|

| 0:11:12| And you all know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| That's an opportunity that we reflect on the state of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| And I present my proposed budget, which council will then review and will vote on in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| So I look forward to seeing you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| And finally, just a quick reminder, this Friday is a holiday for city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| And I hope everyone has a great holiday weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| I know it's Passover, it's Easter, and whatever you celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And we hope that you really have a great family time this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| But we will be closed on our offices on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| And that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| So, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| I had a great event over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Madam Mayor was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Councilman Saunders was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| And Starr was there at the South Woodlawn celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| It was really a cool event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| They became the first certified National Wildlife Federation community habitat in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| There are 75 throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| It took them about two years to achieve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| And what it amounts to, in essence, you have 50-plus homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| You have to have churches, schools, businesses that provide a shelter, food, water for birds, mammals, butterflies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| to where in that community they can thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| And we had folks here from the national office and from the state office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| It was at Stanley's Greenhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| And it was just really a great event and a culmination of a lot, a lot of hard work over a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| So, it's a big deal for them to get the first accreditation in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| And, of course, it goes right hand-in-hand with the Labitat that was opened at South Doyle Middle School earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| And then, of course, doves tell off ions in the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So, a really nice event and a great honor for them to achieve that certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| Right, and I know they'd love for other neighborhoods to join with them in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| So, they're the first ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| But there's other neighborhoods that are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| I'm sure they will be glad to provide some guidance, South Woodlawn Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=809)|

| 0:18:20| And the one thing I was thinking about Mr. Gator the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1100)|

| 0:29:00| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Yes. I just, I guess we have Jim here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Jim, this is something that's been a long time in the works with both studying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| what was the cause of the flooding and how do we fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| and I know lots of folks in North Hills and elsewhere are thrilled to be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| that eventually we're going to have Prosser Road fully open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Can you tell us just a tad about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| and how it affects any flooding on Timothy, the road, the crossroad that comes into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| Can't clearly answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| There are underground, it is all a karst area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| There are channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| It's not 100% clear how this will affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| We know that they're connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| We know that if we pump down the pond on Timothy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| that we do get eventually some elevation difference up by Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| The Prosser Road project by itself should not affect anybody else downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| or upstream very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| We're maintaining the same amount of storage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| We're just getting it up above the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| You're raising the roadbed so that we're above the water on Prosser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Does that mean you might have to take a second look at Timothy after you're done or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| Well, we're going to start pumping Timothy on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| The least expensive way to do that is to rent pumps and bring them in periodically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| rather than put in a permanent emplacement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| So just sort of a maintenance or control thing on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Yes, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| I want to ask you, can you give us a ballpark timeline on this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1849)|
| 0:30:59| The Prosser Road project should be done by the end of the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Part of the contract is to finish the Zoo Drive portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1864)|
| 0:31:13| The part of Zoo Drive that's sunk, we're fixing that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| but that's just the first 100 feet or so outside of Prosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| That's going to be done in time for the grounds to be accessible by fair time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1882)|
| 0:31:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| The final completion will be done by the end of the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1900)|

| 0:32:33| Is Joe Walsh still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| He was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| I don't know if he's in the distant wings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Joe, as you're coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| just tell us a bit about how this might interface with the Williams Creek Trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| that will be coming sort of north and south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| and you're running sort of east and west from Sarah Moore Green over to the Botanical Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Joe Walsh, City of Knoxville Parks and Recreation Department Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Councilman, we see the process of building greenways in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| connecting parks with parks and schools and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| We do segments as we allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| So this segment, taking it from Sarah Moore Green over to the Botanical Garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| where future plans would be to connect the Botanical Garden over with the Williams Creek property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| which we just recently acquired from the Tennessee Clean Water Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| and then, of course, eventually taking that greenway and getting us over to Riverside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| and down to the river, down to Nan McWhorter Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| That's all part of the east-west corridor plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| It's going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| But this is a small segment but an important segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| And we're going to do pieces at a time as we go in this overall master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| That's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| And this was an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| This is an annual grant we're applying for through the Department of Environment and Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| This is a smaller segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| It was more affordable, so we felt like it was an opportunity to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| and hopefully we'll receive this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| That should probably be great for opportunities to learn from the Urban Ag Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| and the activities they're doing over at the Botanical Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| It should help the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Actually, this all started, this idea came from one of the assistant principals at Sarah Moore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| I was there for a meeting a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| and one of the assistant principals was talking to me about needing this segment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| because there is no sidewalk or corridor between the school and the Botanical Garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| which is just two blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| So this will certainly open up the opportunity for them to take advantage of that great resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2060)|

| 0:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2101)|

| 0:36:01| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| Mayor, I'd like for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Mr. Wetzel to come forth and tell us a little bit about the history of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and what exactly we're asking for on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you, Councilman Grave, for the opportunity to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| What you're being asked to look at tonight is a pilot program for the Farragut Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| This is a building that's been mostly vacant for the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Right now it has one current occupant in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Over the last six years that I've been in this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| we've had at least three attempts to try to get this building back and restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| and back off the ground again and up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| and those have not been able to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Most of those were on the residential side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| This new hotel concept gives us a way to do something that's very exciting for our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| It gives us a high-quality product that will enhance retail engagement on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| with 190 rooms at the heart of downtown at Farragut and Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| or Gay and Clinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| It's pretty exciting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| So what you have in front of you tonight is a pilot resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| There's also another part of this request that you're not voting on tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| that we'll continue to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| There is a request for some other contributions in the form of facade improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| or potential parking concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| This is a $40 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| It's a very complicated financial stack that these folks are trying to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| I think they've met and talked with most of you all about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| and so this is just kind of one of the first steps in getting their financial piece together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| so they can go and talk really to the new market tax credit folks about what's needed next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| And the developers are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| and they'll be happy to come up and answer any detailed questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Bob, this is an exciting project in the sense of sort of rescuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| and bringing back the Farragut Hotel building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| but there are several questions in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| I know you and I have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Is there some way to do this with less than a 25-year horizon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| I'm sure someone's done a lot of math to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| but it seems like an awful long time to defer paying the taxes on the new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| in terms of sales tax or property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Again, not sales tax, property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Certainly, there's been a lot of discussion over the last several months on arriving at this $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| We've started talking at lower numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| but you keep coming back with the development team that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| basically, this is what needs to happen for our development to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| And the people that have done it with less in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| or have tried for less in the past have not been able to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| So it seems to be the number that it's going to take to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| We would like for it to be less, but you've got to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| as soon as it gets occupied, the amount of sales tax it starts to generate is quite considerable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| plus hotel and motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| That could be possibly close to a million dollars a year in those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| So while we are giving up property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| we're taking a vacant structure and producing quite a bit of taxes on the sales side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| That's the plus of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Let me ask you a separate question, and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| are we, in essence, setting up this development group to compete with businesses downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2346)|
| 0:39:13| that didn't have the advantage of a pilot and maybe, you know, have overcapacity of hotel space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2353)|
| 0:39:22| Are we going to start taking beds away from other hotels that live downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| I'd like to answer that one this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| This is very typical of what we've been doing with our pilot program for the past decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| As we've had older vacant buildings downtown, people have come along and wanted to develop those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| We've worked with them to try to put financing packages in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| whether it's been residential, whether it's been retail, whether it's been restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| And in every one of those situations, they're competing against the last people who came forward to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| But it is the tool that we've found that's necessary to get our old buildings preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| And I think while there is some concern in that area, in this industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| that's really a concern in all the industries that we do, whether it's a residential, retail, or restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| We have had a strong base of support, and it's all working, and we need to continue to make it work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Councilman, I mean, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Yeah, I'd just like to add, you know, kind of dovetail off Councilman Della Vopi's comment there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| about the other ones that were there beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| I mean, granted, they didn't get some of the same financing and opportunities as this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| but many, many others, I mean, all the money that we've invested in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| through similar projects and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| those people are the beneficiaries every day of that type of investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| even though they didn't get it on the front end, but they certainly benefit from it on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| So, valid argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I hear what you're saying, but I think we all need to keep in mind that that's, you know, they do benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| Just because they didn't get it on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| they're certainly getting it in a harder economic time than when they probably first took over ownership of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2458)|
| 0:41:07| So, you know, it's beneficial for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| And I had a little concern, too, on the front end about the amount of, you know, hotel rooms that are coming downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| and I called Kim Bumpus, and, you know, she assured me that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| it may be a little harder on the front end, you know, in the market for them to all play together well in the sandbox, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2481)|
| 0:41:32| But what it does do is give us the opportunity to have more hotel rooms downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| and bring events downtown and citywide events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| I mean, we, you know, we have a lot of citywide events here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| So it certainly benefits the market in the long run because it does give them that ability to sell Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| and have folks combined in the investment that the city has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| So we want to ensure that those investments, you know, come to fruition and continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| And, Bob, I think it would be just, if you could just take one minute to, or a couple of minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| just to explain what a pilot program is because a lot of people think that the city is writing a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| and we're doing this and we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| So I think it would be beneficial for the audience in general to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Typically, a pilot program, the payment in lieu of taxes program, allows the city and the county at the same time to continue to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2541)|
| 0:42:31| what practically happens, we continue to collect the same taxes that we're collecting on the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| and we're just forgoing any increase based on the new investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| So there's a new investment that will create quite a bit of new potential increment in the TIF program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| That increment will go towards improvements on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| And the pilot program, it just says you don't have to pay those costs to allow your project to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| So there's no money out of pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| We're getting the same thing we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| And if we sit here and do nothing tonight, if we were to do nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| then we would still get the amount of taxes we're getting in that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| but we'd have a severe liability on our hands as opposed to a potential asset on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| So it'll be run through the IDB, and then the IDB actually becomes the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| and these folks become the tenants of the building at that point in time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| So there's no upfront cash contribution at all on the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I want to say I definitely support this project, and mainly because this is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| I mean, it is 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| But the type of development is unique in that it's in a historic hotel that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| And when we look at pilots and TIFs, and in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| based on the ones we've done so far in the last two and a half years that I've sat here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| each one of those projects has been very unique, be it environmentally challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| or been for other reasons they've been challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| This one is a challenge because it's really hard to get hotels financed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| and the improvement costs that they're going to have to bring this about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| and to restore the building and to give Knoxville an historic hotel that's renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| is a really important piece to the downtown development that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| It's unique, and it's something we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| I would not be as excited about it if it was more apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| I would not be excited about it if it were something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| But this is truly something that will be a landmark for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| It will increase your tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| I've often mentioned the Poinsett Hotel in Greenville, South Carolina is a draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| I've stayed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| This will be like that, a historic hotel or a fun to stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| But it's not for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Not everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Some people want brand name, and that's not what this is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| So it's unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| It will attract a different type of stay and a different type of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| I think it really, really gives us a great calling card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| So I fully support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Yes, I also think it will be a great asset for the city, especially for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| But, Bob, if you would, and it's in our packet somewhere about the number of jobs it can produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| because there are a number of people that are needing jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| and this hotel, if everything falls into place, it will produce a number of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| If you could give us a ballpark number on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| You're sending me back into my packet, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| I want to say that number is close to 140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Yeah, 130 to 140 is what I was thinking, permanent jobs in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| This is not during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| This is post-construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Councilman Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Yeah, I just want to say, too, that I'm excited about this project in terms of what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| It's going to be a real asset to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| The other thing I want to say is that I want to thank Mr. Larson for coming by and personally meeting with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| And from a public standpoint, I'd like to have them come and tell us a little bit about themselves and the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| I think they have a successful record behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| They have a couple of hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| And if you could share that with us and share that with the public, I think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| We'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Brian Larson, Halo Hospitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| My partner, Tom Colonna, with Pacific Capital Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| My company, Halo Hospitality, is seven years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| I've been in the hotel business for 30 years, worked for Hilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Actually was on task force when the Hilton opened in 1982 here at the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| I was much younger then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| But I've been a hotel general manager, sort of a troubleshooter for the major hotel companies around the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| Went out on my own on the real estate side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| Met Mr. Colonna on a hotel that he owns in Lake Arrowhead, California, which I am now the asset manager of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| And we branded that as a married autograph, renovated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| The Farragut is very similar to my first project in my company, the Citizen Hotel in Sacramento.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| The Citizen was a building that was built in 1917, Cal West Insurance Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| We did an adaptive reuse with a very complicated public-private arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| Brought the Citizen online, $75 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| And it's very successful today, 198 rooms with a restaurant that's a fantastic farm-to-fork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| I noticed in your Visit Knoxville publication that you listed all your farm-to-fork restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| We're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| I'm the board chairman of the Sacramento Convention and Visitors Bureau, which we branded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| We had Sacramento named the farm-to-fork capital of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| It's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| We love the Farragut because, like the Citizen, the brand is Knoxville, not Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| Even if we eventually were to hang a collection flag on it, the first brand would be the Farragut related to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| We intend on reaching out to the community thoroughly and listening to what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| We actually had 100 town hall meetings with the Citizen before we did Grange and the Citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| And we incorporated much of the information and had a lot of local investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| And they love the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| It's the living room of Sacramento, and we intend on doing the same thing here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| Also, if you would, I thought it was interesting you made the presentation when you had the open house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| And then also when we were talking yesterday, I know several of us are concerned about the other hotels and the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| And I thought it was interesting if you would share with all of us what your hotel, the Citizen, has done to the other hotels in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2911)|
| 0:48:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| You know, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| In 1995, we had 900 hotel rooms, full-service hotel rooms in downtown Sacramento.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| That's exactly what you have here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| We now have 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| We expanded our convention center to 384,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| The Citizen was the most recent hotel built, but we also built a 500-room Sheraton that fully publicly financed, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| The city owned that hotel and sold it for a $45 million profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| But a really big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Our occupancy in 1995 was 74% with 900 rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| Now with 2,500 rooms, it's 76%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| Your convention center is 500,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| I did offer you, Mayor, yesterday to we'll trade you straight up and give you two future draft picks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| We're trying to expand our convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| You have a great facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| The issue with your other hotels is that the typical size of group that you'll book, the sweet spot, is 2,000 to 2,500 rooms on peak nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2968)|
| 0:49:37| But you have 1,300 rooms, including your select service downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| It's not enough to capture the groups to fill your convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| We'll add 200 more, so it will be 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| You start to get into competing with the Chattanoogas of the world for group business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| I think Knoxville is one of the best group destinations in the United States in the mid-market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| It's very walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| It's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| There's no blocks downtown that I'm not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| There's a great restaurant scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| We're excited about the prospects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| But I believe that your last nine hotels that were built are running significantly higher occupancies and rates than your full-service hotels that were built in the last one in 82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3005)|
| 0:50:15| And it proves that there is a taste for hotels at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| The Oliver, although it's small, is very successful and very high occupancies and rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| So I think our hotel will be a different, unique kind of a product and will bring a destination branding effort to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| But didn't you also say that with the Citizen it also bumped up the rates of the other hotels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Two examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| The Hermitage, actually, I'm a friend of the president of Omni Hotels, which just built an 800-room hotel in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| The Hermitage, before the Hermitage opened at 120 rooms in Nashville, the average rates in the downtown were $120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3048)|
| 0:50:58| And the GM there was kind of attacked by his colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| And he said, yes, I'm going to take the top 3% of your business, and I'm going to charge them twice what you're charging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| The Hermitage now runs $300 average rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Knoxville, after the Hermitage, before the Omni, went from $120 to $140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| And he told all the GMs, you guys are all going to make $20 more a night, and you won't have done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| The Citizen did the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Our average rate before the Citizen in the downtown was about $160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| It's $180 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| 198 rooms shifted that because we reset the top end of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you, Mr. Larson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Okay, Council, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| 12B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $388.50 from the Parks and Recreation Department's Grants and Benevolence Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140415?start=3104)|
