| 0:01:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| The ayes have it and the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Mayor, I'd like to withdraw 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| That is the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| The text, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Any conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| I plan to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| I think it's just easier without a date attached to it as to when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| So rather than have continuations, I would just rather withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| But it's not a dead issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| So that's the ordinance on the numbers of dogs and cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| So there's a motion to withdraw that and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| The ayes have it and that is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| Any other items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| Mayor, not to be withdrawn, but I do have an item I'd like to have tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| And that is number 10C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| So it's a motion to table 12C, which is the signs, the billboards and signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=177)|
| 0:03:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| This has really been postponed for a number of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| And what we'd like to do is that actually this is really a subset of really a comprehensive ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| that we've taken a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| In fact, council is having a workshop a week from Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| We have been working with the neighborhood groups and with the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| and we will be bringing this or it actually goes back to MPC before it comes back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| So I'd like to table 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| So there's a motion and a second to table 12C, dealing with signs and billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| That item is tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| How about added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| So our consent items are 11A through C, which are certificates of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| 11M through U, pensions, and 12F to G, 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Yeah, I just want to make one comment and pay close attention to 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| This is $5,000 from my 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| What this is going towards is the city of Knoxville has purchased an entire block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| 1,700 block of Texas Avenue at Minnesota,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| and the intention is that the city will tear the existing buildings down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| and replace this with homeownership houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| And this money is to be developed by the Chideaus that are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| But this $5,000 will go toward the design of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| and utilities to further this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| And it's in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| and I think it's a very worthy project long-term for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| I just wanted to call your attention to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| We're very pleased to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Councilman Grieve, is that an old light there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| With all of these consent items, did we have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| The ayes have it, and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| For the mayor's report, first I want to say it was great to see so many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| so many council members and city staff at the Martin Luther King events this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| We had a visit from Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| and he gave a wonderful presentation at the leadership symposium last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| Also, speeches from John Siegenthaler and Dr. George McKenna yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| Mr. Siegenthaler at the Thursday luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| and Dr. McKenna at the service after the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| And a lot of people are out to see the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| It was a long parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| It was really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| And I just want to recognize all the people I know on our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| and people in the community with the Martin Luther King Commemorative Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| who worked so hard to pull off those events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| and I don't know if it seems seamless to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| but it seems seamless to those of us who just got to go and enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| So it's an important time of year in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| and I appreciate the work that they have done and how well it was implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| Also, I want to remind council that we have the city's annual budget retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| which will be on Friday, February 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| We changed the time a little to accommodate the governors coming in that morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| this annual breakfast with the Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| so we're all invited to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| So if you've not RSVP'd for that, please make sure you do with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| But we will start at 9 a.m. and go to about 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Hopefully get finished sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| And we will stay there at the convention center where the governor's breakfast will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| so that will allow us to take care of both of those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| We'll be hearing a mid-year update from our finance director, Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| and along with some status reports of many of our major initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| and we'll kind of be talking about different kinds of options that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| kind of what we see coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| So we'll see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| Also, just to remind council, I'll actually be leaving tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| to go up to the annual legislative conference for the U.S. Conference of Mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| That is Wednesday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| Weather permitting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Weather permitting, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| We understand they've got, I think, four inches right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| but they were expecting six to ten, so we may be doing okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| So as long as our plane gets out of here on the way up there, I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| All the mayors have been invited to the White House on Thursday for an extended session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| about a four-and-a-half-hour session with part of that time with the president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| but also with cabinet officials and such to talk about some of the policies that affect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| down at the city level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| But I will always be available by phone, e-mail, and text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| and, of course, my able staff will be here, and they will be able to answer questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=472)|
| 0:08:02| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| So anyway, you can always find me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Finally, we do have some good news to share about city staff members doing good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| Of course, we have a lot of news like that, and we often bring this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| This time it's from the law department, and our deputy law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Is he here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| He didn't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| He's too modest to come, but our deputy law director, Ron Mills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| received the 2014 Community Programming Advocacy Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| from the Southeast Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| That's a long name, but basically this is for Ron's successful efforts representing the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| before the Tennessee Regulatory Authority in a disagreement with AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| The city challenged AT&T's refusal to take the steps necessary to carry the public, educational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| and government channels operated by RCTV to its U-verse customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| So the city, along with Knox County, filed a complaint with the Tennessee Regulatory Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| and a three-member panel of the TRA found in favor of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| and Ron really put that whole argument together and presented it before the TRA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| And they basically found in favor of every local government in Tennessee with public access channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| So if you're watching this on AT&T's U-verse network, you're directly benefiting from this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| So anyway, we really want to recognize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Give him a round of applause for great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| Moving on, council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Yeah, I'd just like to remind everyone that we've got a workshop on the 30th in this room here on signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| and billboard ordinance and beginning in this room at 5.30 a week from Thursday on the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=584)|
| 0:09:55| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Yesterday, the Proton Therapy Center in the third district in Dow Springs treated its first patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| And this is a huge step forward in medical treatment for cancer patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| not only for the city of Knoxville and Knox County, East Tennessee, and really the whole nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| And they will be treating 213 proton centers in the nation, and so they will be expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| I think right now they're focusing on prostate cancer treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| but they will be expanding to other forms of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| The big advantage is that it's much less damaging and fewer side effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| So I think we need to be very pleased that they chose to locate in the best city in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| I think if I remember right, the closest proton center is Jacksonville, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| So this is certainly a help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| I think they helped choose because Terry Douglas lives here, so that didn't hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=656)|

| 0:15:14| Council, we do have two people signed up, one person for this, two people against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| Councilman DeLvopo, do you want to hear them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Yes, I'd like to ask a question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| The only thing I noticed in the MPC minutes was concern of some neighborhood groups that they hadn't been heard yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| and it was announced that there was going to be a meeting the following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Mr. Donaldson or one of the applicant folks, did that meeting take place with the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| That meeting occurred with Omni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| There have been discussions since then with Omni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| They have voted once to support the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Because that seemed to be the issue that was kind of pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| and there was talk about there were going to be other hearings before the Historic Zoning Board and other events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| but they felt a little bit left out that they hadn't been spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| And there have been four or five hearings since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| and Ms. Gonzalez has appeared at two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| So they've removed any objections of sort of not being involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| And she has voiced support for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Well, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| So two people that are signed up that are opposed to this are Tom Miller and Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| You'll each have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| Did you want to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| I guess, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Yes, if I may, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| By our normal procedures, the people for it speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| So, Mr. Seymour, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I'll start your timer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Mayor, members of Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| We are here on second reading on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| This involves the old Moses School in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| We are requesting zoning from C-6, which is a general commercial zone that even allows manufacturing, to O-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1034)|
| 0:17:23| And we have filed a use on review under the O-1 zone to have this developed as a multifamily residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1043)|
| 0:17:34| And to follow up on Councilman Dellavope's questions, let me tell you the process we have been through to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| We went to MPC on the zoning in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| It passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| We have been here for first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| It passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| We have had two meetings with the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| the last one being last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| And at that point, the only division was whether the old gym, which was added onto the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| could be demolished as part of the redevelopment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| The Historic Zoning Commission has passed a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| and issued a certificate of authority for this project to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| MPC heard a use on review at its last meeting, which apartments in the O-1 zone require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1105)|
| 0:18:35| and unanimously recommended approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Mr. John Dempster is here with me from the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| They have owned this building for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| They are selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| The idea is the Boys and Girls Club are going to consolidate facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| The purchaser, whom I represent, is a HEPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| It is a Greek organization, American Hellenistic Enterprise, et cetera, association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| that provides low-cost housing for the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Now, let's deal with the elderly first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| That's anybody 62 or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| I don't think that's elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| The average age of their tenants is in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Oh, by the way, I left out one other public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| We went to the Board of Zoning Appeals last Thursday also to get two variances for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| They intend to take the old Moses School and convert it to apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| There will be 48 apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| There will be an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| They intend to build an addition with 30 apartments for a total of 78 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| The income limit is between $35,000 and $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1199)|
| 0:20:08| So when people say low-income housing, $35,000 is a pretty good income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| if you are retired and do not have the normal expenses you do day-to-day working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| So everybody that has looked at this likes the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| There have been some noise made that this is not appropriate for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| which has met with our clients, the HEPA supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| This is an organization that sees as its mission the development of housing of this type throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| They have done reconstruction of historic buildings before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| They have an architect who specializes in that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| They have over 90 facilities around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| So the issue for you all tonight is land use, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Should the property be zoned 01 rather than C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| And I think everybody that's looked at that would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Is this an appropriate site for low-income housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| And I don't want to use low income in a degrogatory way, but that's how we refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| It's housing for elderly people who have income under $40,000 or $35,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| Everybody that has looked at it said, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| We need people like this in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| This is a perfect location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| There's public transit available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| And this organization has been looking at Knoxville for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| trying to find a perfect location for what they try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Judge Varlin is the head of the organization here, and he's been working with real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| Your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| And the Boys and Girls Club for a lengthy period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| And now we'll hear from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Mr. Tom Miller, you're first, and then followed by Bentley Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Sir, please state your name and address for the record, and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| My name is Tom Miller at 1017 Oak Avenue in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1342)|
| 0:22:31| We'd like to postpone this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| It's pretty much the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| I've got a petition with Councilman Daniels with 40 homeowners in our neighborhood who have signed it that oppose this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1357)|
| 0:22:48| The meeting that we were talking about, that's been talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| was supposed to have been a fact-finding mission with the AHEPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| and members of OMRI that could show up and ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| And at the meeting, they decided to vote and support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| This was five people, five homeowners out of a total of 55 houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| that have unanimously figured that we all want this project, and we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1392)|
| 0:23:22| We oppose this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| We'd like to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| Let me just start by we've grown our neighborhood from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| About 30 years of construction, taking condemned houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| We've put sweat equity into our neighborhood, built our homes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| and we've made Moses Center what it is, a prime piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| In 1995, the city gave the Boys Club the property for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| They've developed it and used it to whatever they've used it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| They're still using it today, so it's not an unoccupied project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| KUB's been a – KPD has been a big help in keeping our neighborhood clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| of the crack whores and the drug addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| They're still constantly patrolling our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| trying to keep it an above-average neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| We feel we should try to have a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| I'd rather have a dialogue with you than trying to make statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| We feel that an impact study should be made on what's going to happen to our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| other than just our property taxes being lowered or property values being lowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| We've worked hard for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| We've built it up, and we're a fragile neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| And a project such as this, which will double our population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| we have about 78 residents, owners and tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| and they're going to put another 78 people into our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| We'd like to find out what the impact's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Trash will be picked up, say, in the middle of the night, and that's going to be noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| As far as transportation, the people aren't going to have transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| so they're going to have a new bus, run the buses up and down our neighborhood like they used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| The EMS will have to be there like they do down at the Mission, and KPD will probably be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| So those are just items that I found are going to cost the city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| They're only going to get about $1,300 worth of property tax on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| From the city records, it's appraised at $138,400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| and they only receive – the city receives about $1,300 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| and the county gets about $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| So I can't see where this is going to be a profitable venture for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| We're going to lose in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| We're going to lose just our property values, but the city of Knoxville, who's going to support all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| What we'd like to do is postpone this for six months, three months, so we can have a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| and so we can find out what the impact is going to be on our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1584)|
| 0:26:40| That'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Again, if you could just postpone this for us, we'd appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| so we can have a dialogue and come back with something that would help our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| What is this project going to do for our neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| What are they going to give our neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| We just want to have something positive come out of it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Free time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you, Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Now, Mr. Marlowe, again, state your name and address, and I'll get the timer going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| Hi there, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| I'm Bentley Marlowe over at 322 Douglas Avenue, which is in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| I own five properties on Douglas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| I also take care of my neighbor Mike Elliott's property on Douglas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| and his building up in the historic zone at 501,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| and also I'm here speaking on behalf of Barb Delancey and Anne Smelser on Kansler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| They all could not make it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So I've been in Mechanicsville for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| I'm pretty active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| We started the Neighborhood Watch about four years ago, and at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| when I say Mechanicsville, I'm talking about historically the whole neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| not just the historic overlay, but all the way up the hill to Exeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| And in that area, counting the overlay, there's approximately 540 residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| we calculated off of the ward maps when we set up our Neighborhood Watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Of those, almost 60% are already low-income housing, owned or managed by KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| We're talking about now adding 78 new units to be low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| Enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| There is enough low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| The density in Mechanicsville is way too high for low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| It needs to be dispersed into other areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| This is especially important right now when you see trends in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| UT has purchased two buildings from KCDC for the use of office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| and possibly classroom space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| You have the Hatcher Hill purchase of the Prince Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| which will be turned into office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Mechanicsville is on the rise, and this project will do nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| but hamper that progress or perhaps stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| For example, my experience is with my rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| I have a two-bed, one-bath house on Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I get $1,000 a month rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I'm not even in the historic zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| I'm not in a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| I don't have a huge yard like that building has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| That building is best suited for a high-income rental location, maybe even mixed-use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| not low-income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| My objection is primarily with the use of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| and if that means I have to be against the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| if I have to live with it being C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| and take a risk that the Boys and Girls Club sell it to a manufacturing plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I'll do that because at least a manufacturing plant will bring jobs into my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| I mean, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Moses is probably one of the largest buildings in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| It's certainly one of the most architecturally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| and historically significant buildings in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| and to allow it to go to a subprime use is just unconscionable in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Knox Heritage spoke at the Historic Zoning Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| and they spoke against the gymnasium being demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| They wanted it snowballed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Well, the developer can't get tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| so the developer is going to demolish the gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| That's the problem with making affordable housing and non-affordable real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| It relies on subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Affordable property makes affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| If you take an architecturally, historically valuable building that's in a prime location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| it's just not affordable to make it into affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| And I'm sorry for the developer, but perhaps he needs to look elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| And finally, if you look at the map of Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| the percentage of tax-exempt properties is staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| There are 16 churches within four square blocks of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| APA is a tax-exempt entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| They'll do nothing for the tax base in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| I guess at the end of the day, I'm speaking on behalf of myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| the neighbors I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| and the other 40-something neighbors on that petition that are against the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| and against this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| And we're all willing to say, leave zoning alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Leave it C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| We'll take that risk before we'll take this low-income development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you, Mr. Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Madam Mayor, can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| No, you don't get any more time, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| That's according to our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| Not unless one of the Council members calls on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| I was going to say he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| We've had talk in the neighborhood for the way the property has been zoned now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| that we could put solar panels and windmills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| So if it was zoned the way it is and stayed the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| they would probably fit into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Okay, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Yes, I wanted to ask Mr. Seymour, what would the apartments rent for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| We're talking about low-income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| What would they rent for, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I wish I had that at the tip of my tongue, and I do not, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| They are not market rent because they are subsidized, but they are charged rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| They are not KCDC housing where you have rent vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| It's a standard rental agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Over the $35,000 to $40,000, is that per individual or family or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| These are all one-bedroom units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| We anticipate at the most there would be one occupant or two, husband and wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| and they would all rent for the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| They're going to be basically one-bedroom apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Some will be slightly larger because of the classroom size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| but they'll be one-bedroom, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| It's not assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| It's just rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Councilman Dalibopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| While you're there, Arthur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| you mentioned that there were room for 48 apartments in the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| and that somehow they were going to get up to 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Is there an addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| There's an addition for 30 other units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| They would be of the same kind, in other words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Yes, one-bedroom units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| I don't know if there's anyone that can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| There was a lot of talk there about a decrease in nearby property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and I don't know if that can be substantiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Can someone speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| If, in fact, the Boys and Girls Club obtained the property for $1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| the sale is going to be for over $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| We're going to lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Well, I wasn't speaking of the why in particular, just nearby property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Can someone at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Mr. Dempster is in the property business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| John Dempster, 4066 Valencia Road, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| I'm the chairman of the property committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| I'm a board member of the Boys and Girls Club, have been for about 17 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| I've been quietly marketing this property for well over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| This is the first group that stepped up and actually made us a concrete offer to purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| We are selling because the overhead is killing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| The police department is moving out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| They're consolidating their facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| and we're going to move the operations we have in this club over to the Casual Avenue facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| We're rationalizing our real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| We can't afford to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| We are going to move out, and if we don't sell it, we'll board the building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| Something else I need to address is that if this hearing is postponed, the deal is dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| because AHEPA has a February 3rd deadline for the application with THDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| If they don't meet that deadline, they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| So it will kill the transaction, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| I appreciate that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| I also think I'm not aware of any situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| where low-income senior housing has negatively affected property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| And I'm really kind of shocked that people are opposing housing for our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I would add the contract is I'm not at liberty to disclose it, I don't think, unless Mr. Dempster does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| But it's well over north of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| So I don't see how that could have any adverse effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Well, I mean, maybe our own in-house with Becky with the city or somebody could just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| can you speak in defense of these claims that Mark or someone just to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| is this going to affect residential properties nearby and take their values down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Can we recognize Mr. Marlow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Yes, Mr. Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| I just want to say that I'm no expert on what this effect will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| I think this goes back to Tom's comments previously that maybe an impact study needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| And if that kills the deal, then I'm sorry, developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Don't try to rush projects over in Mechanicsville because we're getting a little bit more assertive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and not just allowing ourselves to be a dumping ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| But one thing I think stands out is if you look at the subsidized low-income housing over on my side of Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| down on Douglas, my property values are nowhere near what they are in historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| And the only reason that there's no subsidized housing in historic overlay is because the overlay has protected those property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| People that develop those properties are not going to go into subsidized housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| because they can get much higher rent on the open market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| So I do believe there is some merit that you can see just by property values in Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| that anytime you have low-income housing, it brings property values down, at least in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| That's our experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| And the only final point I want to make out is let's talk about the owner of this development, APA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| Five-minute Google search, you can find that they're in a bunch of federal litigation over substandard housing quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2220)|
| 0:37:08| There's an insurance company over in South Carolina that's in federal court with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| because the majority of their residents are coming down with upper respiratory problems because of black mold that's been persistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| And APA has done very little to nothing to abate the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| And that's just not a tenant that we need in this city or a landlord that we need in this city, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2242)|
| 0:37:33| Based on the comment that was just made, I think it's only fair to let Mr. Seymour respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| With some substantiated comment, I would suggest that if there's any evidence of a situation like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2260)|
| 0:37:50| it be produced in writing rather than an assertion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| And I suggest also that opposition to low-income housing could lead to other violations of federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2274)|
| 0:38:06| I mean, if they have objections to the use as single-family housing, where the funds come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2286)|
| 0:38:16| what the income levels are is not an issue I don't think city council should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Okay, we do not have a motion at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Councilman Brown, are you calling on him again or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Well, I was getting ready to make a motion, but since he's here, we can hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| Very quickly, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| This is what I was saying earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| We need to have a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| There's too many questions, too many things that are unanswered that we need to find out before this project goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| If all we have to do is postpone it, they can come back at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| If it's a good project, they can come back with the same deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| If it's a good project, we'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| But right now, there's too many questions that aren't answered, and nobody can answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Well, Mayor, I want to say that I did attend the Omni meeting, also the Mechanicsville neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2349)|
| 0:39:17| and heard the presentation by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| I just got this petition today, and no one else has called me or emailed me in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| And it sounds like I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| or not it's just considered low income, and low income is not always bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| And if this does not proceed, something else worse could be in the Moseley School building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| So I'm going to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Well, I guess I'll go back to what Mr. Miller said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| I mean, I see no evidence in the MPC notes in the minutes that y'all opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| We sat here last two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Y'all didn't oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| I've gotten nothing, no emails, no calls from anyone opposing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| And I guess I'm wondering why y'all are so late asking for, you know, for more dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Let's hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| I haven't got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| Well, this entire thing came on so fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| and the developer is pretty candid that it came on so fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| because they're trying to meet a February 3rd deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| October 25th is the application date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| Nobody in the neighborhood heard about it until early December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| And then there was the Omni meeting at question was advertised about seven to ten days beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| and Omni's meetings have been very sporadic of the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| So it was kind of difficult, caught most of us by surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| particularly when reviewing the email from Kathy about tearing down the gym| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| and changing the views of the main elevation of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| I thought it was a no-brainer that the overlay would stop this or cause a significant variation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| And once we found that Omni, with five members present, voted to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| there was a rally call amongst all of us sort of in shock and disbelief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| And we targeted historic zoning, believing that was our strongest argument to derail this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| was the demolition of the gym and the proposed location and size and footprint of the addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| So that's where we focused our efforts, and that's where we made a big turnout at the historic zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| In fact, I think the zoning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| historic zoning commission stated that we were the largest turnout for any proposal that they had seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| So there is a significant and sustained opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| We got in late because we weren't notified until late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| You know, I think the property looks, you know, been out there, looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| I think it suits for, you know, for additional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| We're not here to determine low income or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| We're here to determine whether this is a good use for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| And, you know, it looks like it could be a good use for multifamily property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| That's what we're here to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| And I think the opposition, you know, if you guys had a problem, you should have asked us for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| But we've looked at it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| I tend to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2548)|

| 0:42:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2552)|

| 0:42:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2575)|

| 0:42:59| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Now, before we move on to this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I failed to recognize somebody during my report that's here to share some good news about the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| Doug Lawyer with the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Do you want to come forward, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| Sorry, I missed you earlier on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2593)|

| 0:43:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Doug Lawyer, 116 Heron Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| I'm here tonight to talk briefly about some exciting news and talking about sustainability initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| We in the economic development business have seen an increased interest in sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| and how a community reacts to sustainability from the economic development perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| We're seeing it often in requests for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| As companies are looking at our community, they're asking those questions about sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| How does your community embrace sustainability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Workforce is demanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| People want to go and work for employers and companies that are practicing sustainable initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| Recognizing that, about a year ago, the Tennessee Valley Authority's Economic Development Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| launched a program called the Valley Sustainable Communities Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| The goal of that initiative was to link economic development initiatives and sustainability initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| The Chamber, along with several city departments, including the city's Department of Sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| Erin, thank you very much for your efforts on that, city engineering, city public service, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| MPC, were all involved in an initiative to go through a pretty lengthy certification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| There were three key areas that TVA and their consultants looked at the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| Those areas were economic aspects of our community, what's our economy look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| what's our land use and zoning look like, how do we handle innovation in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| They looked at environmental aspects of our community, looking at such things as do we as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| increase energy efficiency, how do we handle transportation, how do we use our natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| how do we conserve water, how do we recycle, encourage citizens and companies alike to recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| Then finally, societal aspects of our community, looking at things such as air quality, green design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| green construction, health and wellness programs, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| So we went through this lengthy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| It was announced back in December that the city of Knoxville was the first community in the entire Tennessee Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| Authority territory to receive platinum certification as a sustainable community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| which is the highest level we could achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| So we were very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| We had a press conference back in September announcing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| I'm here this evening to officially present the trophy that we received, which, by the way, is made of recycled glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| Had a trip to Nashville back in December along with Aaron, and KUB joined us to accept this on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| So I just wanted to formally thank everyone for participating in this and present this to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| What do we do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| So from the Chamber's perspective, from an economic development perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| we incorporate this in our marketing message as we talk to companies around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| and around the world that are looking to locate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| And we've got a great inventory of all the sustainable assets of our community now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| So we're out selling this message to the world and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| So with that, Mayor, I'll hand this trophy over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| I'll accept it on behalf of the city and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2782)|
| 0:46:33| Can you get us a platinum one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| That would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| All those words you said are music to our ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Certainly the sustainability, linking economic development, sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| has been what we've all been about the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| So thank you, council, for supporting all those efforts, and we've got this nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| If you all want to take turns having this in your office, we can spread it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| We're now on 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Rocky Swingle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| representing 16 petitioners of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| for a hospital and medical office building in an 01 district subject to 17 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| property located on the south side of Middlebrook Pike, west side of Old Wise Garber Road, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| We've got several people lined up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| We'll start with the appellants, Mr. Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Our rules are either side can have three people for up to five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| and then at the end the appellants come back for a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Did I have that right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| So we'll start with Mr. Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| And then followed by Jerry McManus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Those are the two for and then who are for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| And then those against the appeal are Melanie Burgess, John King, and Jeff Fletcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| So, Mr. Swingle, let me get my timer up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Go ahead and start and give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| I'm Rocky Swingle, 7213 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| I'm here to urge you to approve the appeal before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| This appeal asks you to take one of two actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| First, it asks you to overturn the MPC approval of Tenova's use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| Second, if you don't feel like you can overturn it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| then the appeal asks that you add certain conditions to the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| Those 12 conditions are listed in the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| The reason you should overturn the MPC ruling is that their approval fails to meet the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| of Knoxville's zoning ordinances that govern use on review decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| Let me focus on three of them, character of the neighborhood, property value, and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| First, the use is not compatible with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| The neighborhood is primarily residential with single-family houses, condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| and apartments on three sides of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| The Dowell Springs office buildings are not the predominant type of development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| Second, the development will injure the value of property adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| The MPC staff report makes two comments on property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| It says, quote, the use will not significantly injure the value of adjacent property, period, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| Based on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| There's no report, study, data, expert testimony, or anything else to support that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| The burden of proof is on MPC to show the ordinance is satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| A one-sentence opinion fails to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| The second comment says MPC staff examined the potential impact of structures of this height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| meaning the hospital, on the surrounding area and, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| we believe the structures can be accommodated with minimal intrusion on the residences located to the south of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| There is no mention of the impact on residences to the west or north of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| where most residences are located, that is, West Hills, Pembroke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| and apartments and condos along Lake Brook and Lakewood Boulevards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| There are hundreds of homes in these areas, and they will all have a clear view of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| Again, the report falls short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I ask you to apply the common sense test to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| For example, residents of Wesley Road and Abington Lane that abut the western side of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| will have only a 46-foot buffer between their property and a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| and a seven-story, 107-foot tall building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Today, all they can see from their backyards is trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| How can a building looming over them, along with the noise and lights from the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| and a parking lot, not decrease the value of their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| Third, the applicant failed to show and MPC did not address the ordinance requirement that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| the use is not of a nature or so located as to draw substantial additional traffic through residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| No traffic study was done to address the impact of the hospital on residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| The Little John traffic study only addressed Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| Traffic is probably the issue that concerns the most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| We were promised that a thorough traffic study would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| The condition proposed by MPC to address the problem a year after the hospital is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| does not satisfy the ordinance requirement to consider neighborhood traffic before voting on the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| It's putting the cart before the horse by solving the problem before it's identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| nor does it keep the promise of a thorough traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| There's more in the appeal, but there are three solid reasons for you to overturn the MPC approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| Some of the issues in the appeal are not related to ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| but fall in the category of what I call do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| One of them is the protection of the South Hillside from future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| This is the part of the site that was not rezoned and remains Agriculture 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| Tenova has said several times that it would be preserved, but without a formal commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| there's no guarantee that that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| Remember, the shareholders of HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Sorry, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Tenova's parent company voted on January 8th, just two weeks ago of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| to approve CHS's acquisition of HMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| Will CHS honor agreements tomorrow that Tenova makes today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| By adding the South Hillside protection condition and others to an approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| you make it much more likely that Tenova's promises will be honored by the new owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| If council needs additional time to consider the appeal or conditions, there's no rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Tenova is not filed for a certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| The earliest they can do so is February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| Applications filed then will be heard on May 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| In order to accept or deny this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| one of you must make a motion to do so and somebody else has to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| I hope you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| This issue is too important to let it die due to a lack of motion or a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| Please do the right thing and support your constituents by supporting this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Perfectly timed, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Jerry McManus, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| My name is Jerry McManus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| I live at 1505 Dick Lowness Road in Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| I am the neighborhood representative for the Pembroke West subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| Before I start, I'd like to hand you this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3230)|
| 0:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| For the final time before the Tenova Hospital proposal goes to the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| Health Services and Development Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| we are here again today because there are issues involved with the development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| the new Tenova Hospital that will significantly impact the quality of life for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| residents in the Pembroke West subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| Unfortunately, these issues have so far been mostly ignored by the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| and therefore will be presented to you again as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| The proposed location of the hospital on the rezoned property is too close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| established residential housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| It does not have to be this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| Simply moving the central location of the hospital to the far eastern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| southeastern portion of the property would make a huge difference in making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| coexistence with surrounding neighborhoods possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| Also, using Old Wise Garber Road for the main entrance of the hospital instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| Middlebrook Pike would eliminate the need for traffic light at the end of Dick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| Lowness Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| It will ultimately make entering and exiting more difficult for Pembroke West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| As established property owners, we want the residential atmosphere preserved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| protected from commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| You are elected by the community to have the same goal and to pursue resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| that help achieve that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Another deleterious aspect of the Tenova Hospital is the height of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| At over 100 feet, it will encroach the scenic mountain views for many residents of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| the Pembroke West subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| These people invested in this property and paid a premium for these views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| And a building built on this site should be limited to 70 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| I would note, however, that if the hospital was moved farther east on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| property, the building height would be less of an issue because it would no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| longer be in direct view from homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| Finally, neighborhood residents do not want a helipad on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Pembroke West is situated at unusually high elevation, meaning that the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| helicopters make will be magnified much more than in a flatter terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| Also, if the FBI building in Dallow Springs decides it also wants a helipad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| the neighborhood atmosphere will basically be destroyed and housing values will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| plummet with two helipads surrounding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| If Tenova must have a helipad, they should build it on a more appropriate site that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| is not near residential housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| I truly believe that the way this proposed development is handled by the City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Knoxville will make a statement as to how much the city respects the rights of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| homeowners versus the financial influence of big business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| Everyone is watching, and if the rights of homeowners are ignored as they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| been so far, it will be noticed and it will degrade Knoxville's reputation as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| desirable city for people to come for a high quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| If it becomes apparent that investing in a home becomes a risky endeavor where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| commercial development is allowed to basically build with more concern for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| bottom line than for the community, then Knoxville will become a second-rate city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| Sir, you have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Hopefully some real compromise can be made today and some reasonable residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| concerns can be alleviated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| We do not feel like we're asking too much here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Now we hear from the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Melanie Burgess, I think you changed your name since last time you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Big life event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Big life event, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Great life event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| One of those good life events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Actually, my husband is, you know, gunning for husband of the year for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| Congratulations to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| If I may, Madam Mayor, I'm introducing some matters for the record, which I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| to just briefly describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Why don't you come to the microphone if you're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Is this the appropriate time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Mr. Swanson should have these, but they consist of minutes of city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| of October the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| There are some minutes of the Metropolitan Planning Commission for their December the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| 12th, 2013 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| There are MPC meetings for the July 11th, 2013 meeting, and there are also copies of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3540)|
| 0:59:11| the MPC staff reports on both the rezoning and the use on review on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| There are some other letters in there in support of this proposition, all of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| I delivered to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| He can just pass them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Go through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| So name and address, and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| My name is Melanie Burgess, 200 East Blount Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| Here with me today are the project architect and civil engineer, as well as other Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| representatives who are in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Tonight's discussion of Tenova's replacement hospital project is the culmination of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| orderly and thorough public process that began with the announcement that we had acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| an option on 107 acres on Middlebrook Pike for the purpose of building a replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| hospital for Physicians Regional Medical Center, also known as St. Mary's Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| We made that announcement on January 6th, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| Subsequent to that announcement, we met with neighborhood groups consistently over a six-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| period in order to share our plans and to listen to input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| On July 11th, MPC agreed unanimously that 01 is the appropriate zoning for the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| on the north side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| That decision was in line with the one-year and sector plans for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| On August 21st, we conducted a workshop with this body in order to provide more detailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| information regarding the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| On October 15th, City Council approved the 01 zone for this site, and on December 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| MPC overwhelmingly approved our use on review application to build a hospital on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| subject to 17 conditions, each of which we've agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| Various objections have been raised through the appeal process to MPC's decision, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| we'd like to address some of those objections with a reminder of several facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| This site is in an area of high-impact employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| It does sit among industrial, institutional, commercial, and medical uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| The development of Dowell Springs has created a medical node in this section of Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| making the hospital an appropriate use for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| Dowell Springs includes major medical services and large physician offices, which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| complementary to the hospital development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| MPC conducted a thorough analysis and review of this project and our use on review application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3685)|
| 1:01:32| And through that process, as well as input from the neighborhood, everything possible has been planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| in order to minimize the impact of the development on nearby residential areas, including building strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| and materials that minimize or eliminate light intrusion and noise from the lighting on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| the central electrical plant, and that provides substantial vegetative buffers between the nearest homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| and the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| We understand and have heard on many occasions that the primary concern about the project is neighborhood traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3715)|
| 1:02:03| As requested by MPC, we conducted a traffic study of Middlebrook Pike this past summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| We then added information and data to that study in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| As a result of that additional information and our discussions with city engineering and MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| we will be conducting a baseline traffic study of the neighborhood traffic when traffic begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| to have an actual view of the traffic at the time that the project is begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| We will conduct those studies and another study one year after the hospital has been opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| in order to have actual traffic numbers rather than projected or estimated numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| The results of those studies may suggest installation of traffic calming features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| And if traffic calming is necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Tenova will be responsible for payment of a substantial portion of the cost of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| In addition, we will do everything feasible to instruct our patients, our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| emergency personnel, and physicians to use the main traffic arteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| including installing blue hospital signs along the primary routes to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| and providing printed driving instructions to patients and referring physician offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| that direct traffic along Weisgarber and Middlebrook Pike rather than through neighborhood roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| In addition to traffic calming measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| we will also be providing pedestrian crosswalks to the signalized intersections adjoining our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| as required by MPC staff and city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| which includes features for the protection of pedestrians and accommodates their access to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| Tenova has made a concerted effort to communicate with and listen to the homeowners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| And as a result of those conversations, we've made numerous changes to the original concepts for the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| many of which we've reviewed with you in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| such as adding a walking trail for the public to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| and creating a greenway connection that's needed in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| moving the emergency department and the helipad to the far east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| You have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you. Far east side of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| As a reminder, we do have an average of one ambulance per day with its sirens on and one helicopter per week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| several hundred feet of green space between the facility and the nearest homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| and protection of the slope, the 44 acres that will remain green and be in use for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| In addition to the accommodations I've already listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| we'll, of course, comply with all federal, state, and local requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| related to wastewater management, geologic surveys, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| It's important to note that there is another approval process following this local land use review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| which is the Certificate of Need application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| It is important that we have completed this land use review process prior to submitting the Certificate of Need application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| Since that is a site-specific process, we need to know that we can utilize the land as designated in order to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| So to recap, after extensive review, MPC did approve our use on review overwhelmingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| They have subjected us to 17 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| We agree to those, and we ask that you affirm their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| I think we are finished presenting unless there were questions to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Okay, so Mr. King and Mr. Fletcher are here just in case there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Okay, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| So, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Oh, actually, there's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| The appellants are offered a two-minute rebuttal, should you choose to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3916)|
| 1:05:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| State your name again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Rocky Swingle, 7213 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| I just wanted to clarify the condition about the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| The condition says that a study will be done now, a year after the hospital is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| Another study will be done a year after the hospital is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| If traffic volumes increase by 20% or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| the applicant will be responsible for producing and implementing a traffic-calming plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| with the cost to the applicant not to exceed $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| $150,000 is not a substantial amount of money when it comes to traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| The condition sets a threshold of 20% based on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| And it comes up with a solution, a traffic-calming plan, before the problem is even identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| And, again, all of this happens after the hospital is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| The ordinance says that MPC has to consider neighborhood traffic as a basis for their vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=3994)|
| 1:06:43| to deny or approve a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| This is happening a year after the hospital is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| You have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| It's just it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| It doesn't fit the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| It doesn't fit common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| It doesn't solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| It's completely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| Okay, Councilman Manelovopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Let me start with asking Mr. Donaldson about that last point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| Did you jump the gun in the sense of you have to study the traffic before you can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| or how do you respond to that statement that really that's part of the initial decision rather than a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4039)|
| 1:07:29| Well, the intent of the condition was to, one, establish a baseline now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| to take a picture of the traffic upon the opening of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4054)|
| 1:07:42| and establish a threshold of substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| That's the 20 percent factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| And then provide for the mitigation of that issue if indeed there is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4070)|
| 1:07:59| Traffic calming can range from anything from speed bumps to traffic diverters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| and can effectively eliminate all through traffic through a neighborhood if you so approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| And that could be one ultimate condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| It doesn't necessarily have to be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| I have seen neighborhoods eliminate all cut through traffic with the installation of a few bollards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| and the requirement that traffic wind around a neighborhood based on local knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| rather than cutting through a highly connected neighborhood based on the assumption that you're going to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| So there are any number of ways to mitigate any potential problem that does crop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| Our intent here was to try to establish a baseline, measure the post-opening traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4130)|
| 1:09:00| and determine whether to establish a threshold of substantial change and then address it if indeed it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4140)|
| 1:09:10| Let me see if I can get my arms around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| The first part is you need the hospital to decide how much traffic is on the local roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| and that's why you do the baseline after it opens and you wait a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Or is there a way to look at it in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| We're going to capture a baseline now to establish what the existing condition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| Then after the hospital opens, they will do a study to establish what the post-opening condition is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4170)|
| 1:09:38| compare that to the threshold that we've established, which is arbitrary, but some measure of substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4178)|
| 1:09:46| and then mitigate that impact in the event that there is one through any number of techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| with the applicant's financial contribution not to exceed $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| That's the second part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| How did you get the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| What was the basis for circumscribing that contribution level if it exists, the problem exists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| Based on the experience of staff in trying to determine what substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| and what a substantial change is compared to no change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| and then with some knowledge of what a variety of traffic calming projects cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| not knowing exactly what's going to be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| Traffic calming slows or deters traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| It's not like you have to do physical road infrastructure things, which usually are very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| That's the choice of traffic calming as the tool of remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| Any number of techniques are available, probably starting in the $5,000 to $10,000 range per application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4250)|
| 1:10:59| and up depending on how much engineering you do and reengineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| If I could, I'd like to ask Melanie, is it Burgess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| I changed your name to protect the innocent here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Congratulations, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| I noticed the first condition, of course, is that this all hinges on them getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| or you getting a certificate of need, and if it doesn't, obviously the rest of us kind of moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| Let's go to the second part that Mr. Swingle didn't mention or have time to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| which was why not some additional conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| And there were two or three that stood out as the different speakers spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| One was can you move further east?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| Does that alleviate a problem or does it make a new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Melanie Burgess, do I need to give my address again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| And I will probably ask Josh Stewart to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| who represents the architecture firm that is planning this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| but I'll answer it from my understanding first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| and then if you'd like more technical details, he can fill those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| The architects have taken what they believe is the best approach to developing this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4328)|
| 1:12:15| to maximize the available buildable land in a way that is least intrusive to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| but also allows us to build in such a way that we don't have to add things like parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| A parking garage would not be, I'm sure, received well by the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| So the property and the way that it's situated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| and the narrowness of the property as it goes further east, it narrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| We run into some water issues on the far end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| And the architects have used their very best professional judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| in placing the hospital in a way that is as buffered as possible from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| but also maximizes our ability to use the property that we're purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| I assume that over time you may be expanding the hospital if it's successful at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| so you want to save some buildable space, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| In our experience, it's a very bad idea to build a hospital in a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| where you have no room to expand at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| You've tried that, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| We've tried that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| In that same vein, one of the objections that I heard tonight was, well, it's too tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4397)|
| 1:13:25| Can your architects or you describe why you can't make a shorter, wider building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| or something that perhaps mitigates the height visibility issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| that was raised by one of the gentlemen back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Again, I could allow Josh to address this from a technical perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| I think that's probably the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| All right, let's hear from Justin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| State your name, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Josh Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I'm an architect with Thomas Miller Partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Business address, 5210 Maryland Way, Suite 200, Brentwood, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| To touch on the site specifically, Melanie, to reiterate what she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| as you move east on the site, it does pinch down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| and that would cause us to have to make the hospital even taller than what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| There are also, looking at the water management, the topography on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| it gets a little lower on that end of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| So we feel that the placement that we have the building shown is the optimum placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| Because of the width and the stormwater runoff and things like that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| Yeah, and the width of the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| How about a lower building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| Was that looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| The challenge we have with patient rooms is by code we have to have a window in each room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| When you're looking at a 300-bed facility, barring a large, sprawling building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| which would cause us to have to build parking garages to meet parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| and also, again, just working with the site itself, that would be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| So we feel like the height is based off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| The proposed building has a couple of double, actually quad patient wings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| so we haven't just gone completely vertical with the patient wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| We've looked at ways to make it a little lower than what it could be if we just went straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| By doing wings you get more window space, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| So we've looked at that to lower the impact of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| And I have one more question for Millie, or maybe it's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| I lose track, but the comment was made about the 44 round number acres that is the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4540)|
| 1:15:50| One of the conditions that was suggested was some further requirement that it be somehow put in a conservation easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4550)|
| 1:15:58| or something done to it to make sure it's not just a statement but a follow-through thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| Have you looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| What's the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| And so let's step back from that for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| When we originally purchased the option on this land, we were buying 107 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4570)|
| 1:16:18| Through the process of examining and better understanding that land and the architect's investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| it was clearly communicated to us through our professional architects and engineers that that 44 acres is essentially unbuildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| It's not acreage that we want to try to build any sort of hospital facility or medical office facility on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4593)|
| 1:16:41| So when we went for the rezoning, the north side of the creek was rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| The south side was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| It remains under agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| So, again, first there are limitations in terms of how it can be used based on its zoning today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| It's kind of a safety valve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| If you're going to go anywhere and you run out of land, you're going to go up the hill, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| Except that we have experience trying to build on the side of a very difficult hill, and it's not something we would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| So we've made commitments in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| We've made commitments in front of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| We've made commitments to the neighborhood groups in every way that we possibly can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| other than doing some sort of deeding of that property over to another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| We are unable to do that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| We don't own the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Two, our parent company has Treasury Department regulations regarding the ways in which we can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| and the mechanics for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| So the property currently has the agricultural zoning on it, and it has slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| We have never presented a plan to any permitting authority or to any building authority to build on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| and I would assume and hope that the neighborhood would come and fight us ferociously if we attempted to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| So at this point in time, we don't own the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| and cannot do any kind of mechanical conservation easement or something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| As we move forward with the project and we gain the approvals that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| then the mechanics of how we assure the community that we don't intend to build on that property will become more clear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| And then I guess the last issue that keeps coming up is the traffic study, you know, a reasonable argument was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| well, shouldn't we know more on the front end so that we have some assurance that's going to be dealt with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| And there's been a mechanism set up with the two-study approach, the baseline and the follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| and some dollar limit commitment to do remedial work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| Why not bite the bullet and do the study now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Well, you may remember that we offered to do that a number of months ago, but we offered to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| Y'all asked Dwayne to pay for half of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| We did ask Dwayne to pay for half of it, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| We asked the city to pay for half of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| From our perspective at that time, there was a lot of mistrust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| and of course when someone comes in to develop a piece of property, if we presented a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| it was our thought that the community would like to see that in partnership with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| so that it wasn't just Tenova having an answer that sounds good for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| As everyone stepped back from that, one of the things that we all recognized is that we really do need this comparative study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4761)|
| 1:19:30| Before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Before and after, because our traffic engineers, and we have a gentleman here who is an engineer and can affirm this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| but our traffic engineers tell us that they cannot project how many people are going to choose to cut through the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| What they need to do is compare what's happening today versus what happens after the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| We all have been through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| I've certainly heard enough from the neighborhood to know that there are existing traffic challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| Tenova's hospital will not create the traffic challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| It might exacerbate some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| But they may exacerbate them, and if they do, then we have a responsibility to help to mitigate those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| And we're certainly ready and prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Having been on council now for four years, a couple of things that I'd like to say is that one of the things that Tenova has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| from the very beginning has been very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| They've been very open with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| They've been very open with the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| I don't know of a single time that they haven't agreed to meet with anyone who's been involved with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| And I think personally that they have bent over backwards in a number of issues in terms of things that they have committed themselves to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4842)|
| 1:20:51| I know they had extensive work with MPC and these additional conditions that they have agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| And I think that I'm not sure that there's any other place in town where a development is taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| where there's a 30-acre green buffer between the development and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| And they have consistently agreed that they're going to put a greenway through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| They've consistently agreed that they're going to protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| I have spent time with them talking about conservation easements and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| but they can't do anything, as Melanie was saying, because they don't own the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| But there is a commitment on their part as far as the future goes in terms of what they might be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| I know this has been kind of heartburn for the neighborhoods and especially the people right around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| We met last night with the West Hills Neighborhood Board and also Wesley Woods, I mean the Wesley neighborhood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4902)|
| 1:21:50| And those folks are willing to support the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| They're willing to continue to work with Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| And they really feel that Tenova is going to be a good neighbor and really provide for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| And I think with what's happening in that whole area along Middlebrook that this will become a medical hub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| as they talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I do have a question for Melanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| I noticed that you said you had Mr. Fletcher here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Was he going to make some comments about value of land or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| No, I think unless you'd like to have a discussion about property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| The one thing I will mention about property values, and this is a debate I know that you hear a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| and it's very difficult to substantiate a stance one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| What we do know is from a development in Atlanta that's very similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| the Johns Creek Hospital that Emory built in Johns Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| which is a very upscale neighborhood on the north side of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| Thomas Miller Partners were the architects on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| And it's a similar kind of situation, except that I would say it's much more visible to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| It sits on a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| It's very visible to neighboring properties because it sits above them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| It's visible through the tree line when the leaves are off the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| And from before the hospital project to just after the development of the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| that community had a 9.5% increase in property values, and that's a different community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| But generally neighborhoods find hospitals to be good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| and that is our intention here is to be a good neighbor to the West Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| Well, I think also what should be pointed out is that you're not only going to be a good neighbor to the West Hills area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| but I think that you're continuing to be a good neighbor where the present facility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| in terms of what you folks are trying to do there in terms of maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| and seeing to it that that facility is going to be useful on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| So as the representative from the 2nd District, I fully support this project in terms of what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| and I fully support the fact that Tenova has really worked hard to work with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| And I don't know, Mark, are there that many developers that are required to do this kind of a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| that you've asked them to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| So I think that, again, I think they're going to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Councilman Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Yeah, that was my only question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| Again, back to the property values, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| It was the single comment that Mr. Swingle said about were those words out of your mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| or Mark Dawson, one sentence, or what was it about, you know, unsubstantiated comment, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| about the hospital won't affect those property values adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| That's a statement in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| Probably more blunt than it should have been, but there is more and more evidence that the case against development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5082)|
| 1:24:54| based on diminishing property values is starting to be chipped away by data that comes in to support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| you know, son of a gun, that development didn't affect the property values other than increase them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| Just read a recent book called Climbing Mount Laurel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| Mount Laurel was one of the first land use cases involving affordable subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| Back in the early 70s, it went through two Supreme Court cases in New Jersey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| and professors at Princeton decided to follow up post-construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| and determine what were the actual impacts of building that particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| and found that crime did not go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| It went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Property values did not go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| They went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| Schools were not negatively impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| They improved, and the tenants in that project benefited greatly by the opportunity to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5148)|
| 1:25:58| while not negatively affecting the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| So it's a book that just came out this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I would suggest all of you read it, Climbing Mount Laurel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| Mark, along those same lines, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| we have this property that's sitting there, and it's obvious it's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| So, you know, in my opinion right now, the hospital is going to be a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| But what would happen, let's say, if it was a Walmart or a, you know, a big box store like a Lowe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5186)|
| 1:26:34| or a Home Depot in terms of the effects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| In this book, did it talk about different types of developments in terms of what could happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| Would a development like that necessarily cause more traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| Would it decrease the value of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| This particular book dealt solely with the issue of affordable housing in a suburban location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5213)|
| 1:27:01| But for a long time, the land use plan has called for office uses on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| including the 01 Zone District, which is titled Office Medical and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| So the proposed use is a hospital and medical office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| are consistent with the plan that's been in place for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5238)|
| 1:27:25| All right, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Just for the record, I'll be abstaining for a conflict of interest that the Fermat workforce representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| Tenova on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| I just want that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Yeah, if I could be permitted to make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Oh, I was just going to say we could recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| I have just one other inquiry, and I could ask either Jerry Askew or Melanie Burgess to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| I just wanted to know if you are still actively looking at the remaining activity that will be on the Oak Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| Emerald Avenue site, and is there any news to report on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| Because obviously that's the other side of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| It's not pertinent to the use on review as much, but it certainly is a communal issue that we're all interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| And you all have tried to, I know, keep people informed about that, at least in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| Where is that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Well, we are making slow progress on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| We are working to solidify the architectural plans and what would need to be changed for the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| dependent upon what kind of tenants and what kind of services we provide there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Thomas Miller Partners has done extensive work on that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| We are talking with a number of organizations, some of them non-medical related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| but administrative type organizations that could potentially utilize the two office buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| which would be great use for that space and certainly have a bustling, vibrant presence on that campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| And then, of course, we're solidifying the services that we will continue to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| and we know for sure that those will include primary care, multi-specialty clinic, 24-7 access for folks who are having a medical emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5346)|
| 1:29:17| inpatient rehab services, and the behavioral services that we currently have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| So we're working on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| It's a little bit of a chicken or the egg until folks know for sure that the new hospital will be moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| They're not going to commit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| So we have a number of confidentiality agreements, but this is incredibly important to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| We love that campus and long history there, and we want to make sure that it remains a vibrant part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| Is there a time frame when a public meeting would be appropriate for you to talk about that more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| Obviously, it's premature now from what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| Yeah, I think within the next couple of months that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| We appreciate you continuing to look at that because that has a communal impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| and you are certainly an important member of that community and represent the jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| and some of the housing support by people living there, and that's on everyone's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| Yeah, ours too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| I would just like to say, Mayor, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| it strikes me that this is one of the best presented on both side issues we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| and I'm really impressed by the professionalism of both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| and it's one of those tough hand-wringing issues, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| But condition number one strikes me as answering what would be my main objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| and that is it's conditioned on getting the certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| That's apparently where the battle is going to be fought if the neighborhood wants to pursue it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| in terms of should this hospital be built there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| And I have a hard time, even though my heart chugs in a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| I have a hard time opposing the use on review question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| I think that first condition is certainly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| But I do want to commend everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| I think Rocky Swindle and Melanie and the others have all worked to put a lot of information before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5464)|
| 1:31:12| and it's been very professionally done, and I, for one, appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| I also agree with my colleague on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| But I would like out of courtesy to represent Dr. Kenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| Let me respond to that, because in the previous matter that came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| you just called on people to come speak just because they had expressed an interest to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| But this is an administrative quasi-judicial hearing that you're engaged in now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| that gets run pursuant to certain rules that you all have adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| And when you depart from it, those rules are created in order to create fairness to both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| to create fairness for the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| And so when you start departing from those rules, as you are about to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| you have an issue of whether or not you're departing from fairness to both sides in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| Because then if you call on somebody to just come and talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| then you have to call on somebody on the other side to just come and talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| as long as somebody wants to just come and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| And that's not consistent with the rules you've created for this quasi-judicial hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| So if you have a specific question to ask, that's provided for in your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| If you have something you need, some information that you need to derive in order to make a decision in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| then it certainly would be appropriate to ask members of the audience any question that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| But just to invite them to come and speak outside of the rules that were adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| and were in place before all this started, if somebody wants to speak, they knew they needed to sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| But here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| The Sisters of Mercy would have a way of touching your knuckles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| That's why we have a law director to keep us on track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| So at this point, we've had our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| And I believe to take action, we would need a motion to approve the appeal by Mr. Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5580)|
| 1:33:09| Is there a motion to approve the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| I'm going to, if I might, Mayor, I see Mr. Swingle standing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| and I don't know if he has a simple statement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Well, it's what the law director has just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| Well, he is a speaker, and he has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| And there may be something added in the last 20 minutes that it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| He signed up, and he used the time that was allotted pursuant to your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Ask the ruler again, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Sorry, Mr. Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| Is there a motion to approve the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| Without a motion to approve the appeal, this resolution fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5625)|
| 1:33:53| 11D is a resolution honoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| and congratulating the Webb School of Knoxville's football team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| upon the occasion of its most recent state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Understanding that the Webb team could not be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| so I think they wanted to be originally, but they weren't able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| We're still very glad to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5655)|

| 1:38:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| 11L is a resolution authorizing the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| to partner with Knoxville Zoological Gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| to apply for a grant from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| in the amount of $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| with the Knoxville Zoological Gardens funding $313,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| and the City contributing $1,000 in City staff time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| and if such application is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| to accept such a grant award for a renewable energy system at the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Mayor, I need to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| I'm on the Zoo Board, and we receive no remuneration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| I do support this, and I will be voting for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| but I just wanted to make that disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Well, I need to make the same disclosure, for I'm on the Zoo Board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| And you also get paid zero to be on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| On the Zoo Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| I'm just wondering, will we no longer be able to buy Zoodoo once they turn this into energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| and put it on our tomatoes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| It'll be even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| It'll be even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| I assume that this is the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| I don't know who's here to speak for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| but the idea was to, one, save money, and, two, find a renewable energy source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| which sound like very positive goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| I'll pass after that, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Can we just, if we needed a further explanation, because this is an exciting venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| Why don't we get Erin Gale to come up, our sustainability director, and give us a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Thank you for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| I'm Erin Gale, 400 Main Street, City County Building, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| I'm also here with Sharon Moore, the development director for the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| This is an application with the Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| The idea would be that we would ask for 50% of the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| approximately 50% of the funding required to install a renewable waste-to-energy system at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| The idea would be that we're using the yard waste, so to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| not touching the compost that you're receiving, but using their yard waste that the city is currently collecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| processing that with a gasification waste-to-energy system that would produce electricity for use at the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| and subsequently saving the city some cost in hauling that to our current mulch contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| I assume that as part of that, you'll deal with any potential odor that that would create?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| We actually have a meeting set up currently to sort of discuss some of the logistical details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| and hammer through those technical details to make sure this is a win-win for the city, the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| and the community surrounding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| I would like to recognize Mr. Umoja Abdul-Ahad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| I know it must have been 20 years ago when I think I was at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| when he started talking about the benefits of Zoodoo and how that can be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| So I hope you're pleased to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| The zoo is currently engaged in developing a strategic plan to take us down the road and have lots of improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| but one of the big pieces of the zoo's new development and leadership is sustainability in every possible area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| So working with the Office of Sustainability has been a real plus in moving us along that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| 12B is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| If you all don't mind, so we can give our full attention to these ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| I'd like to take a very brief break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| If you all in the audience would just bear with us for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6100)|
| 1:41:58| Adopting the 2012 edition of the International Green Construction Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| providing for the review of plans, inspections, and the collection of fees, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| providing penalties for the violation thereof, and providing for a delayed effective date of May 1, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| Back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| Mayor, we have a substitution motion to make on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| And do you want maybe, Christy, to explain where we are on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| I'll explain where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| So this was first proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Christy Branscom, our COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| When we first proposed this December of 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| the Green Code was included in the list of all those codes that were proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| and it was included as a mandatory code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| Since then, of course, you all know that we developed the Green Task Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Easy for you to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| The Green Code Task Force, and we studied the Green Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| and came back and determined that at this time it was probably best to propose this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| as a code that could be adopted on a voluntary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| So that is why there is a substitute motion in your packet of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| and it would propose to adopt Chapters 1 and 2 at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| We'll bring back other chapters as they are ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| but Chapters 1 and 2 of the Green Code for voluntary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| Is there a motion to accept the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| So the motion to amend is to delete the mandatory version of this in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6206)|
| 1:43:35| and to replace with the voluntary version of Chapters 1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| That's my motion, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| I thought it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| It sounds exactly like I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| Is that right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Is that the right motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Did I do that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| Have we got a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Just to make sure I understand this, when Cindy read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| and in the text that we have in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| one of the draft ordinances and the information sheet all talk about the effective date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| as being May 2013, and that, of course, has well passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| And I notice that the second ordinance refers to June or July 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| I just want to make sure it's clear that we're not enacting something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| that's already in effect six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| So the May 1st date, May 1st, 2013, if you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| was the effective date of our 2012 International Building Codes that we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6263)|
| 1:44:28| When you guys voted to approve those in December of 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| we made the effective date May 1st, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| So the effective date is not May 1st, 2013 of the Green Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| And it's going to be June of 2014, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Could I ask one question, May, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Are we going to have training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Let me think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Mayor, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| Well, we have Christy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Can we vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| Eventually you will get to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Are we going to have training for builders and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| I understand the voluntary program will, one, give you a chance to get your feet wet in this new code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| and you're working on the other sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| Two, are we going to train builders and design professionals in terms of our approach and what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| Are we going to have some interchange?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Our first objective is, of course, going to be to train our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| We are going to invest in the Green Code books, which we have several of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| but we're going to invest in more of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| We're also going to invest in their training of the Green Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| how to review plans under the Green Code and how to perform inspections under the Green Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| And then, if you recall from the Green Code Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| there was a list of initiatives that we are going to take as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| The city would help along with the USGBC Green, the Knoxville chapter and the AIA group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| We are all going to work together to try to educate the general public on how to build under the Green Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| So there will be an initiative and there will be workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| and there will be other opportunities for builders and architects and engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| and all those involved in the construction industry to be able to participate and learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| I think this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| I'm glad we're going voluntary at first because I'm a little concerned that we could raise the bar so high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| that somehow we would discourage building that is needed in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| and send them off elsewhere to the county or surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| So I think that's good, and I think it's good to step in the water in the low end for the pool, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| Well, conversely, on the other end, how far out do you see this taking from a voluntary to training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| I mean, could it be two years, ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| What kind of time frame do you see it to become mandatory to meet certain reductions or energy savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| or everything else that goes into the Green Code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| Well, typically we adopt codes every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| So the next set of codes that we would probably pay attention to very closely would be the 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| because those were 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| But we're going to see what comes out in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| 2015 will be the next issue of the Green Construction Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| so that would be the next time that it would be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| So, you know, we will look at it as city staff and if we determine that it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| that we think needs to be proposed in a different fashion, not voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| but perhaps consider it or present it to the city council at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| I think it's important to give the developers, contractors some time, take a look at it, try it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| see how it works, and those who do it voluntarily, that we can work out, you know, make the adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| and then decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| Add to that the design professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| Design professionals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| I'm sorry, I don't want to leave anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| Okay, so our motion is on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| And now we are on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| Which is to approve the first two chapters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| Right, which is to approve the first two chapters of the voluntary code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| We had that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| The ayes have it, and that has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| 12D is an ordinance amending Chapter 26, Article 4, Section 26-410 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| relating to record rotation list rates and charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| Yeah, is there anyone here that can, I've got some concerns and some questions about this proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| The Chair of the Record Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| This is a proposal from the Record Commission, and our Chair, Kim Henry, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| Thank you for being here, Ms. Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| If you don't mind stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| Yes, Kim Henry, 220 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Without going into a lot of detail, I guess, I'm sure there will be some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| In December, we did a review of the information presented by Michael McGovern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| who was representing the record industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| We felt that the information was appropriately presented, appropriate to the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6550)|
| 1:49:16| and we agreed with their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| You know, I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| And again, you know, I've got some serious concerns about the amount of the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| So let's go from the beginning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| So to be in this rotation is a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| In the record companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| Yeah, in regards to these increases that are being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| They are certificate holders, so, yeah, they have to apply for their certificate to be in the rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| But to be a record operator within the city bounds, it's not a mandate that they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| This is my third meeting for the Record Commission, so I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| Keith Shields is here and has a little more history with this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| and may be able to respond to that more appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6610)|
| 1:50:16| Keith Shields, City of Knoxville, 400 Main Street, Director of Fleet Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| Yes, sir, to that point, they are bound by the regulations in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| that they have certain rules and regulations that they have to abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| But, yeah, they are on the record rotation at their desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| They're not forced to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Are all the record operators within the city, are they in this rotation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| just independent and just work at will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| I'm sure we have some that are independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| We do have one of the companies here tonight that he's been coming to most and all the commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| He can speak to that in depth with his experience as being a record operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| But as far as I know, there probably are some companies that are not on the rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| However, I think we do have eight at the present time that are on the rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| And so it's my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| so if they are on a, I don't know if this is right, non-rotating call, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6674)|
| 1:51:21| if somebody just has an accident and they prefer a particular record company over the one that's in rotation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6681)|
| 1:51:30| there's a different rate card, rack card for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| The ones that pull for their city that are directed by KPD have certain rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| that they're allowed to charge for certain types of tows, whether it be an accident, the size of the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| winching it up out of the ditch, over the guardrail, whatever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| They're bound by the rules set forth that they can only charge that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| But that's just for that particular call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| And I would assume that, you know, the vast majority of their calls are outside of the rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| And it's, again, a totally different rate card that they would operate, a much higher rate card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| I can't comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| I don't know that answer, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| I don't know the percentage of calls versus city-directed and private calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| Let's let this gentleman, then, who's got the history, who's an operator, let him answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| Please state your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| I'm Rick Carnes with Clinton Highway Record Service, 3361 Clinton Highway, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6742)|
| 1:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| So my question is, is that when it's a non-rotation call, is there a different rate card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| and what is the difference in that rate card if there is a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| Well, there's not a --it's not set by the city as to what we can or could charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| Only on non-consensual tows, it becomes a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6768)|
| 1:52:57| Consensual tows, the other record companies can charge whatever they want anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6777)|
| 1:53:06| The ones that are not on the rotation, their charges are much higher than what the city allows us to charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6786)|
| 1:53:15| But if your company is on a non--I mean, so, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| all the calls that you all do are initiated by the city or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6808)|
| 1:53:29| We've been in business for 42 years, and we've got a lot of customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| and a lot of contracts and things that we do for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| And this is just a partial of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| It's what we do for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| And your answer in getting me to where I need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6823)|
| 1:53:53| So it's my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, you've been at this for a long time, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| So since at least 2009 and perhaps even before, this record committee has been asking for information pertinent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6838)|
| 1:54:06| increases in business cost to your industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| And you all didn't provide that for up until really concrete information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| up until recently when you hired Mr. McGovern, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| We had to obtain Mr. McGovern simply because of the cooperation between companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6859)|
| 1:54:26| I mean, we are competitors, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| And that information just don't flow from one company to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| I mean, I'm the president of the Towing Association in Tennessee, but they still have antitrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6874)|
| 1:54:43| No, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| They just don't turn that information over how much they're paying for their fuel, their tires, their insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| their employment and all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| That was how we derived it, the amount that we needed to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| Because, see, we've been working for over seven years without any increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| And fuel, tires, insurance, everything has skyrocketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6905)|
| 1:55:12| But you're answering my question very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| But that committee was asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| And because it's proprietary, you all were hesitant to provide that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| But yet, you're basing this 25% increase on that information that has just recently surfaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6922)|
| 1:55:30| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| There were several people that did come forth with information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| And it was pretty well straight across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| But all the people didn't come forth with their increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| I mean, it was a little bit of a problem to gather the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| But now fuel, that's a nationally known thing as to how fuel has increased in the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6948)|
| 1:55:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| And Mr. Gork, you know, he tells us exactly what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| one penny in the increase in gasoline, what it does to our vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| So, you know, I'm not saying that you don't or the industry has not warranted some change in the rates since before this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6966)|
| 1:56:14| But, you know, it's been hard times for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| It's been hard times for other industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| But most importantly, it's been a hard time for our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| And I don't know of a record company, and you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| that has gone out of business in the city of Knoxville when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| When was the last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| They're going in and out every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| They are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| Every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| I mean, frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| Quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| I mean, there's more coming in, these one-horse operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| We've lost a few professional companies down through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| But it's not every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| I mean, that's not something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| Well, I mean, there's not enough for them to go out 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| Well, I mean, I know Councilman DellaVolpe has got a question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| But I'm going to enter an amendment now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| and then we can go ahead and listen to whatever it is you all would that Councilman DellaVolpe has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| So, under Section 1A, there are four tables here that are really what I'm referencing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7031)|
| 1:57:23| Under 1, there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| So, obviously, we wouldn't want to do anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| Section 2, vehicles not involved in a collision towed to a city-allotted direction of an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| They're asking for a 25% increase in those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| My amendment would ask for a 10% amendment to these current fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7059)|
| 1:57:46| Number 3 is a new classification altogether, which I think is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| And they are basing those rates on number 4, which also carries a 25% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7072)|
| 1:58:01| So, I would, you know, I'm glad to accept number 3, but a 10% increase, not a 25% increase, as well as number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7081)|
| 1:58:13| As I said, they recommended a 25% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7093)|
| 1:58:19| I would recommend with this amendment a 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| Oh, and let me say under B, I said A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| And then under B, the table, they also asked for a 25% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| I would ask for a 10% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| And then I would say in two subsequent years after that, a 2.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| And then that way it can get you, you know, I think a substantial increase in the fees that you're asked that you can charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7120)|
| 1:58:49| But it also gives you the market time to see, you know, where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| And that would be 15% over time, over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| And that's a substantial increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| Well, the city has had time to do their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| I mean, if they wanted more information and wanted to look into it closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| they've had the opportunity to do the same study that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| But that's the amendment as I propose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Nothing on D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| Yeah, D, under the storage charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7158)|
| 1:59:25| No, there's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| We're 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| No change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| There's no change on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| That didn't increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| It did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Of course, that's the cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| We didn't increase anything to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| Okay, so just to make sure we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| So that's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| And that is under Section 1A, Number 2, the vehicle's not involved in a collision towed to city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| That's, you're saying, only a 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| So you'd have to go back and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Two and three, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Well, I'm not through that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| So, actually, two, three, and four would be a 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| And under B, Section B, under 1, that table would also be 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7205)|
| 2:00:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| And then what was the two and a half years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| And then two subsequent years at two and a half percent increases to get them to a total of 15% increase over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7216)|
| 2:00:31| Mr. Law Director, is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| That would be a two and a half percent increase effective, whatever the effective date is, in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7233)|
| 2:00:41| and then another two and a half percent effective, whatever that date is, on 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7241)|
| 2:00:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Can I get one clarification on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| So did you say no increase to storage fees for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| Date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| Because we had proposed an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| Does the table have an increase, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| No, that was the towing of the city vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| That was what there's no increase to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| Storage fees did not have any increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| That is D on page 441.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7278)|
| 2:01:19| What were you talking about, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| He's got the same clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| Are you all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| Even the 25% is well under what the rest of our competitors are charging here in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7288)|
| 2:01:38| and across the state of Tennessee, well under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| But this gets you closer to where your peers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| And it's fair, you know, 25% increase is a substantial increase all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| Any increase at all is closer to what we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| And that's why I'm trying to be fair to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| But it's not fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| And we got the opportunity to look at it after three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| But it's an increase of 15% over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Mayor, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| Could I ask one more question to make sure I've got this down right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| Is the 2.5% on the same categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| That you identified already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| Yeah, we have Mr. Shields here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| Let me start with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| But this gentleman, I'd like to ask him a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| But, Mr. Shields, you play a lot with vehicles and vehicle costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| Did you look at these percentage increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| and try to evaluate them in terms of cost to do the service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Either we're asking people to tow cars at our request as the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| when there's a wreck or an impoundment or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| The prices as a whole have gone up, and especially the petroleum fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| the fuel, the tires, certainly labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| I can't comment to their labor rates or their insurance rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| But those rates have been steadily increasing over the years also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| So the things that I can look at that I have in comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| they have a similar picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| And to Mr. York's point, when fuel goes up by a penny, the impact it has on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| But certainly, as fuel goes up and down spikes, they incur an additional cost also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| But as far as the things that I do not have in common, I wasn't able to look at those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| But from the fleet perspective for the city of Knoxville, we have similar costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| maybe not to the extent because of our contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| and how we leverage our strength of our purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| So we're not as greatly impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| but certainly there's an impact in time and the cost we pay for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| Well, the reason I'm asking the question is I understand the cost creep everybody faces as things escalate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7428)|
| 2:03:57| And it has been, what, four or five years, I guess, since they've tried to bump this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| Did you have any disagreement with the amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| or to the extent you were able to compare it to your own experience, does that seem high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| Well, I provided a comparison sheet that I did in 2011 with some similar-based cities of equal size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7452)|
| 2:04:22| It was the color-coded spreadsheet that Christy sent out over the weekend, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| It's not in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| Put it in your email as an attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Well, I apologize, but I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| But what did you find?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| In other words, validate, too high, too low, just right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| I mean, where do you come out from your experience as a fleet guy in terms of these costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| Well, I mean, when I got on the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| I wanted to see what the rates were for other cities also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| to see how competitive we were for my facility and the rates we charged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| as well as validating what the record companies were saying to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| As a whole, before the proposed changes for the record fees, we were 38% lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7503)|
| 2:05:10| This is in July 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| On administrative fee, we were 82% lower than the other cities that I compared with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7512)|
| 2:05:19| And on the storage fee, we were 57% lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| Excuse me, 65% lower than those cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| And this city was lower in terms of amount of reimbursements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Nashville, Lexington, Kentucky, Louisville, Kentucky, Memphis, Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| those were the cities I had good, hard data for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| With the proposed changes that we are recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| the record fee would still be 23% lower than what it was in 2011 for our neighboring cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7542)|
| 2:05:49| The administrative fee would be 78% lower than the other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| and the storage fee would be 57% lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| But really, what impacts them the most is that record fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| The other two are in-house city and Knoxville fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| So with the proposed changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| they would still be 23% lower than what the other cities were charging in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7564)|
| 2:06:11| Well, let me ask Mr. Carnes then a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7571)|
| 2:06:18| I'm very sympathetic to the main point Mr. Pavlis made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| which is it's kind of a big lump on the head to get all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| Maybe it's a function of having waited this many years to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| as opposed to having done it gradually over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| But do you have any problem with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Let's assume that 25% was a decent number or 20% or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| Do you have any problem with phasing it in over two or three years instead of hitting consumers all at once with this jump?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7599)|
| 2:06:46| It's a pretty major jump, and it will come as a shock, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| to some of the lower income people that live and drive in this city and need record services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| Well, it's not really going to impact the people of the city that drive in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| Most of them have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| They're all required to have insurance, just like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| That's for injuring someone, not for towing your car necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| No, that's for an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| I mean, you've got to have liability insurance to drive just like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| You know, whenever they have liability and collision both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| the insurance companies are the ones that are picking up the tab on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| And, you know, they're getting, for instance, some of these tows that we're doing for $65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7648)|
| 2:07:36| and for on a wreck $120, our competitors are charging $350 and $400 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7656)|
| 2:07:46| Do you foresee, without the change, that you'll not have people doing this service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| I mean, people are going to continue to do the service, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| But, I mean, we'll look at it a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| I mean, you know, there's only like eight people in this town that's even qualified to do this kind of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7679)|
| 2:08:07| I mean, what you all don't understand is this is not something that just anybody can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| And anybody just isn't something that anybody can go out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| and buy a couple of million dollars worth of wrecker equipment and go into business and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| You've got a large capital cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| And then the knowledge, you know, the city found that out when they bought a rollback just last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| And they turned right around and sold it before they even used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| Because they found out real quick, like, for the certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| and the driver's license and everything that had to go forth to run these wreckers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7718)|
| 2:08:46| that they were going to be in way over their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| It was going to cost them more to have a qualified, certified person to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7729)|
| 2:08:56| and have that piece of equipment than what they could hire us to do it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| I mean, we're already working way under the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| I got that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| And the thing about it is, like I said, we're whatever happened, the reason we didn't get anything brought to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7747)|
| 2:09:16| we talked about it many times and we tried to get something done about it long before now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7756)|
| 2:09:24| I mean, this wasn't just something, this wasn't just an idea that popped into our head a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| I'm going to suggest that we work on this increase but try to provide the whole thing under two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7771)|
| 2:09:39| In other words, 15, five and five or something, but to ease the transition in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| I think from the comments I heard from Mr. Shields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| I don't know that we have justification to lower the total amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| but I am sympathetic to how fast it gets rolled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| And I think my motion, if I were to make it, would be to simply adjust the ramp up like 15, five and five or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7796)|
| 2:10:06| The only thing about that is, you know, we're already way behind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| Two or three more years down the road, do you want us back up here pleading for more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7811)|
| 2:10:18| Well, I don't know what two or three years is going to produce or not, but I understand your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| We just like to get close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| I mean, we're still under the bar, even at what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| I don't know who can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| How many records are on the rotation currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| I mean, there's eight different companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| And to be on rotation, you need at least ten records, eight or ten records to provide the service that you all need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7846)|
| 2:10:56| Has that number gone down in the last five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| Well, no, it's actually went up because used to we had eight zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| Now we have four zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| They increased the size of the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| And used to we had you could only hold two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| That was back whenever it was a contract situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| So even at these low rates, as you say, there's more and more companies willing to provide this service at that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| What I said was, is there's less zones, so there's less need for the amount of towing companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| Some, just every zone will usually have two or three different towing companies that rotate in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7893)|
| 2:11:42| But you can only have two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| Those are close to your home base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| They need to be, but some of them are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| That's another problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| But there's a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| You don't want to, let's not open that can at the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| No, we don't have time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| Well, I guess sort of my thought of what I was trying to make is that if the rates were so low and unfair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7920)|
| 2:12:07| that over time companies wouldn't, they would take themselves off the rotation and not do these calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| because it didn't make business sense for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| There's four or five companies that did that when we went to rotation over contract because of that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7937)|
| 2:12:23| Why would they want to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| Fountain City, Southern Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| What year was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| I don't know what the years were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| But like I say, why would they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| Ms. Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Well, I mean, everything that's been said is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| The record companies do not have to bid to be on the rotation list, but they choose to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| but then they have continually come to the commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| and complained about the rising cost of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| So for several years they have asked for increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| We asked for information like Mr. Pavlis explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| and we went through the process of trying to accumulate that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| to do some historic research on what their cost increase were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| but we could never get everybody to comply and come along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| The reason why there's more people, more towing companies on the rotation right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8000)|
| 2:13:27| is because that several of them had been knocked off of it for violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| When we meet, we go over violations for companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| and Tracy in inspections brings those violations to them, and we research them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| And a lot of times they get kicked off the rotation period for three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| or six months or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| And then there were five, I think five companies from a long time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| that couldn't even tow with a city contractor on the rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| because they had violated and we suspended their ability to do business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8037)|
| 2:14:03| So now, you know, everybody's been complying with the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| but you have a valid point in if they do not want to have the city business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| they don't have to apply to be on the rotation thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| but they still want to be on it, but they want a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| So what we did was went through the process to get the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| Mr. McGovern accumulated it for the record industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| They paid him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| He supplied it, and the commission reviewed it and came up with the 25 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| as he proposed as being fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| That's kind of why we are where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| Thank you, Ms. Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| I'll second the motion, Mr. Powell's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Are these rates similar to what insurance companies reimburse you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| They're way under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| They are under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Like I said, some of the companies that elected not to be on rotation, they decide, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8097)|
| 2:15:06| why take a few calls at what we're being paid whenever we can take all the rest of the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| and charge them three times the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| I mean, I just want to, again, I think we need to keep this in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| This is one small portion of their business, the way I'm understanding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| And it's not fair to ask this gentleman, but I'm going to assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| and you correct me if I'm wrong, if it's not a rotation call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| you have the ability to charge them whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| There's no rate card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| We do, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| We stick to what we're under, the contract that we're under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8146)|
| 2:15:50| I understand the contractual part of it with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| But I'm saying on a call that is not on the rotation, you have the ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| and I would assume that that would be the vast majority of the calls that you answer to charge them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| whatever you feel free to charge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| And I'm not saying that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| That would be a double standard, you know, and that just wouldn't be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8170)|
| 2:16:15| That wouldn't be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| So, okay, let me ask you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| So then based on what you're telling me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| then this would be your rate card every time that you tow a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| Sometimes it's even less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| But I would, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| I mean, we give away more than we actually make sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| I mean, a lot of people can't afford a record bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| They can't afford storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| And we make provisions for that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| You've been in business for 42 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| Forty-two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| I mean, I'm glad you're profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| I'd love to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| But, again, this is one small portion of, you know, they're going to have to prove me wrong on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8214)|
| 2:17:00| But I think this is a small portion of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| And it's just like our employees, you know, when we did the Mercer study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| You know, our employees were making less than like cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| You know, all throughout the southeast and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| We gave, you know, we did a one-time advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| Did it get them exactly to where they needed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| But it was a darn good start at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| And I think that we need to use that same logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| and same fiscal responsibility here for our constituents to get them more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8245)|
| 2:17:33| And it's obvious that they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| But to swallow a 25% increase all in one fell swoop, I don't think it's fair to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| because you all have been asked, you know, for over five or six years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| for the ability for this record committee to make an educated decision on what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8266)|
| 2:17:55| But your industry said, no, we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| And for whatever reason, I understand it's proprietary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| So, again, I want to stand by my guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| And I think this is a fair way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| And, sure, you're welcome to come back and make all the requests through the record committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| We would expect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| I would expect you probably to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| And that's what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| But I think tonight, to deal with it and be fair to both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| I'm going to stick to my guns on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| We could have come up here and asked for what it would take to level things back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| and get what the rest of them were charging and asked you for a 50% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| But we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| We felt like that this was doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| The commission felt like it was doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| We didn't think we were out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| We presented a graph and figures to document our expenses and our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8320)|
| 2:18:48| And so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| Councilman Pavlis, I just don't get what we're arguing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| I mean, these guys come and they've done their study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| The city's done their study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| They've done the comparison study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| They came back and asked for an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| I mean, who are we trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| We're not saving the city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| We're saving most of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| It's a wreck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| It's been in an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| They're going to have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| It's going to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| The insurance is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| Having a car towed is part of the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| Having it stored is part of the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| If they don't have insurance, then that person is going to pay a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| And I don't see the sweeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| I mean, maybe there's more to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| I mean, I looked at it, and I wasn't anticipating there was going to be some big dispute about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| But, I mean, I looked at what he provided, and the numbers seemed, in comparison to the other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8378)|
| 2:19:43| those other cities seem to be in our region and, you know, similar size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| I mean, based on the information I have, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| they haven't asked for an increase in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| They haven't asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| I mean, the cost to operate those vehicles and employees has probably gone up more than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| So I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| It's what they've come back for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8401)|
| 2:20:02| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| I mean, I think I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| It's fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| The market sets the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8410)|
| 2:20:11| I don't see the issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| Vice Mayor Peralta, I just wanted to confirm your numbers again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| I mean, was it coming up to what they're asking for slowly, or does it stop shy of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| Stop shy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| It would be over three years of 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| And then that, well, you asked me the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| So at the end of that three years, we will have had time to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| providing that the industry cooperates to, you know, to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| where we're at then and make another adjustment if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| But to do it all in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| And even though the insurance company may pay for it, but guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| I mean, you know, who pays for the insurance rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| And if they go up, then, I mean, that affects the consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| So, I mean, I understand the insurance companies pay for it, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| that comes out of our pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| So that's my ‑‑ we bring it to 15% in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| Councilman Dallagopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| Yeah, I just want to make sure I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| I think I've heard what I need to on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| Mr. Swanson, it's a matter of parliamentary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| Do we vote on his motion and then take mine or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| Well, currently there is a motion that he has made and a second by Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8491)|
| 2:21:37| I don't think you have a motion on the floor at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| Is it a procedure to follow through with the first motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| or can I make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| You can make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| I'd like to move, then, that we allow a 25% increase by paying out 15% in the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8507)|
| 2:21:57| and then 5% in each of the successive years so that the full amount would be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| Essentially his motion, but use the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| Different numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| 15%, 5%, 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| The same categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| Same categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| Just recognize that the amount seems to have some real-world justification that we can't ignore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| I mean, but I am concerned about the burden hitting the wall all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8546)|
| 2:22:27| I want to make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| What the committee and all the study and everything has done is asking for a 25% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8550)|
| 2:22:37| but you're still 25% below our neighbors and our people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| And that was dated back in 2011, July, when about a year when I was living with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8564)|
| 2:22:50| I looked at the numbers, and that's the numbers at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| So if we were to do another assessment, they may be even further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8572)|
| 2:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| So the longer we put it off, the further behind they're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| So what they're asking for, what they're coming and asking for us now is the 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| but you folks are still behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8585)|
| 2:23:10| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8590)|
| 2:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| Our lawyers are conferring, but I believe what we're going to do now is vote on the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8594)|
| 2:23:21| substitute amendment made by Councilman Della Vopi, which is the 15% in year one, 5% year two, 5% year two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8601)|
| 2:23:29| That will be our first vote, and we have a motion in year three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| We'll have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| We have a motion and second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| We're going to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| I sort of had a feeling we should have done that to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8632)|

| 2:23:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| So that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| So now we're back to Vice Mayor Pavlis' motion, which is the 10%, and then in year two, 2.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8645)|
| 2:24:13| year three, 2.5%, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| We'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| We'll do a roll call again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8661)|

| 2:24:26| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8668)|

| 2:24:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| Failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| That one fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| So we're back to the original motion, and we have a motion and a second on that, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8681)|
| 2:24:52| is the 25% increase in some of those categories, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| We're going to do a roll call on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| Back to the original, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140121?start=8701)|
