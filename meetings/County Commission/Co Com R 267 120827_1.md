| 2:28:23| And what we see here may be that the maximum length of time to serve is eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8903)|
| 2:28:30| So those two things, in my mind, do not go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| You're talking about the rule in the committee appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| We have a rule in the commission rules that say you don't appoint anybody more than two terms on MPC or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8916)|
| 2:28:43| unless there's no other applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| They're usually longer terms in what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Two-year terms versus four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| Is this in our commission rules, or is this in the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| The ordinance goes back to Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| It's either an ordinance or a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| Well, no, it's after that time because I was on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| I'm talking about the two-term thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| That was our ordinance, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| That was our ordinance, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| So, Mr. Law Director, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| I think it was a resolution from Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| That's just a recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| I've got us off track because really what's before us is just reappointing these people, which I think to be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| You know, I think we do need to put out an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| I respect what Commissioner Brown said, but, you know, our process is when there's an opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| we put out, you know, an announcement that we're taking applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| And I think just to ---- I mean, I know who I'm going to vote for here, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8980)|
| 2:29:45| but I think the proper thing to do would be to put out an announcement that people can submit their CVs or they would have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8985)|
| 2:29:54| you know, pretty good argument that we're just, you know, it's the same old thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| and we're not even considering anyone except people who are insiders already, and then we can vote on this in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| That would be my, you know, my reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| Well, this is just as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| So unless someone ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| I'm just saying that's my preference as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| Well, then, being just a discussion item, there isn't anything before us except for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| So it is on next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| And you did actually pass an ordinance, by the way, regarding your terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| Anything else, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| Did we not vote to change what was going to affect in September for our zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9035)|
| 2:30:41| It goes into effect in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| I just wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| I didn't want to miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| Commissioner Orlandi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| I just want to thank everybody for the prayers for my grandson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| and I'd like to thank Children's Hospital and the staff up there that was very helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| and he is at home recovering very well and doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| So I appreciate the prayers that everybody sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9066)|
| 2:31:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| Any other business come before the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| If not, we are adjourned until 6 o'clock, at which time we'll hear zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9070)|
| 2:31:24| Commissioner Orlandi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9086)|
| 2:31:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9088)|
| 2:31:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9089)|

| 2:31:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| Commissioner Schall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9093)|
| 2:31:34| Before we get started, I think we have one person for public forum on a non-related zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9099)|
| 2:31:40| Mr. Golden, if you'll come to the podium, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| If you could give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9103)|
| 2:31:50| My name is Jim Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9110)|
| 2:31:51| I live at 4139 Skyline Drive in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| I want to read a short definition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| The definition of evil is action or inaction against an individual who has done nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9121)|
| 2:32:09| When I moved into my neighborhood, I discovered that my neighbor, an elderly woman, I'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| call her Helen, had sort of been abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9134)|
| 2:32:21| Her yard was growing up a little bit, so I cut it when I cut mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| Then neighbors started putting big rocks in the yard, so I'd hit them with my lawnmower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| And then they told me they wanted her property to park trucks on, and she had money from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9151)|
| 2:32:38| a husband who had died in a mounting accident, and they were trying to get her power of attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| Then codes enforcement showed up, and her sister came over to my house crying, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| am I going to do about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| And I said, don't worry, I will take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| Then codes enforcement showed up at my house and said, if you don't stop helping her, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9171)|
| 2:32:58| going to tear your house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| That's several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| They managed to come after me pretty hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| I had to go to the U.S. attorney to get it stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| Then her sister said they found her locked in a home and only getting one sandwich a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9191)|
| 2:33:20| day, and so I called adult protective services and we got her placed in a care facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9200)|
| 2:33:30| got some restrictions put on the family that was abusing her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| Then they showed up again, and I called adult protective services and asked them why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9214)|
| 2:33:41| were abusing her again, or coming after her again, and they said, we've lost the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9221)|
| 2:33:48| file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| Bias intimidation is a hate crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9231)|
| 2:33:58| I discovered that Mrs. Evans, an elderly woman on Villa Road, was having her home broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| into when she was not there, so I took one of my cars over there and parked it in her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| It was a cute little Datsun, got 35 miles a gallon station wagon, painted orange and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| white with magnetic football symbols on the side of it and a helmet and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| It wasn't too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| The city towed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| I contacted the city councilman and I said, listen, this car was protecting this woman's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| He said, well, don't worry, I'll take care of it, but he didn't and they crushed my car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9277)|
| 2:34:43| and got nothing but a hard time for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9283)|
| 2:34:52| I later learned that my insurance was canceled on my home, and I learned that other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9292)|
| 2:34:58| in my neighborhood, when I paid my house off, they canceled my insurance and wouldn't renew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9298)|
| 2:35:06| it, neither would some other companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| Then I found out a 100-year-old lady who lived across the street from me, Sweet Miss, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9308)|
| 2:35:13| call her Miss Tennessee, she said they had also canceled her insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9313)|
| 2:35:18| I don't know how much of this is going on in East Knoxville, but apparently we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9318)|
| 2:35:24| a quiet problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| I've gone to the media about it, but I haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| So, there's some shenanigans going on in Knoxville, and I just want to point those things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| And thank you for hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Is that city codes or county codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| That was city codes, which is also in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| But yes, it was city codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| We don't control the city codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| I know you don't, but you're going to be discussing matters that are in a way related to how citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9356)|
| 2:36:04| are handled by codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| Are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| Did I make a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Oh, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| And thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9372)|
| 2:36:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Is there anybody else for public forum on a non-related matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| I'm sure there are for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Madam Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9383)|

| 2:36:32| It's consideration of amendments to the Knox County Minimum Subdivision Regulations regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9392)|
| 2:36:37| development standards for subdivisions within the hillside and ridgetop protection areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9397)|
| 2:36:43| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9403)|
| 2:36:48| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9408)|

| 2:36:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9414)|
| 2:36:55| We have a motion and a second to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9415)|
| 2:36:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9420)|
| 2:37:01| I guess I, lack of a better, I just want to get maybe some dialogue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| I would just like to call on Mr. Donaldson to describe what's going on with the subregs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| Consistent with longstanding practice going back more than a couple decades, MPC has always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| brought forward amendments to the subdivision regulations that have been adopted by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9444)|
| 2:37:31| County Planning Commission for consideration by both the City Council and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| City Council actually adopted the subdivision regulations in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| We had thought that the county had done so as well, so we always wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| that we kept the various versions of the subdivision regulations current with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9466)|
| 2:37:54| Over the last week, there's been a very vigorous search for any proof that the county had adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9474)|
| 2:38:00| the subdivision regulations, and we can't find any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| So, there's no sense in amending a set of regulations that you haven't formally adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9484)|
| 2:38:12| But I would like to speak to the merits of these proposed subdivision regulation amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| Consistent with the adopted Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan, one of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9500)|
| 2:38:28| was to provide for reductions in the regulations that applied within the Hillside and Ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| Protection Area to reduce such things as right-of-way dedication, pavement standards, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9514)|
| 2:38:45| And that's what we've done here with the alternative standards for development within the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9525)|
| 2:38:55| and Ridgetop Protection Area that were adopted by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9535)|
| 2:39:01| There's actually two exhibits involved in the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9541)|
| 2:39:09| One is shuffling things around and eliminating some standards that have been in there for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| for hillside development that have never been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| So, we've removed that and created space for these alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| for development within the protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| And essentially, they reduce the requirements that apply elsewhere in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9570)|
| 2:39:36| by reducing the minimum right-of-way width that's required on a plat from 50 feet down to 40 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9576)|
| 2:39:46| by increasing the maximum grade for a local street up to 15% from its current 12%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| so we're making it less restrictive there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| by reducing the allowable horizontal curve in a street from its current 250-foot radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9598)|
| 2:40:06| to a radius of 105 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| This allows for tighter turns in the Hillside Protection Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| To reduce the pavement width from the current 26 feet that's required down to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9616)|
| 2:40:26| and in some cases, allow them to go down to 12 feet with shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| as long as you work with a one-way pair of streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9631)|
| 2:40:37| To eliminate the requirement for curb and gutter for local streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9637)|
| 2:40:45| With the reduced pavement widths, we did have to turn around and allow a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9645)|
| 2:40:54| for parking within the right-of-way, so we've created standards for creating parking bays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9654)|
| 2:41:01| And given the Planning Commission the authority to set the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9661)|
| 2:41:07| when a street goes both inside and outside of the protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9667)|
| 2:41:15| Now, these standards apply only when there is a development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| through the planned residential zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| and that area is within the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| So, that subject piece of property would already be subject to MPC approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| of the development plan, which allows the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| to determine the minimum lot sizes within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| And then there's an accompanying zoning amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| which is further on the agenda that's related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| that eliminates the minimum required front yard setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| which is established at 20 feet in the planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| We're proposing to eliminate that and replace that with a provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| that the Planning Commission can set that minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| with the development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| So, that's the zoning ordinance amendment, which occurs later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| But the gist is that we've created a set of alternative standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9738)|
| 2:42:24| that apply under certain circumstances in the Hillside Protection Area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| which reduce the amount of regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9748)|
| 2:42:31| It reduces the restrictions that are placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9751)|
| 2:42:34| on all other development in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9758)|
| 2:42:39| Do we have a motion on the floor right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| Motion to withdraw, currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| To withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| Right now we're in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| Right, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| I've had a chance to look at some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| including pulling out the Tennessee Code Annotator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| and I think there's been some confusion on a lot of people's parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| as to whether the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| had the authority to go ahead and set the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9782)|
| 2:43:06| And the opinion from our law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| and from other attorneys is that they, and if you read the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9789)|
| 2:43:13| which I have right here in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| they indeed do have that authority to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| And they do not need the approval of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| Nevertheless, what has been customary in some counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9801)|
| 2:43:25| with some Metropolitan Planning Commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| is that they do bring these forward to the legislative body of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9807)|
| 2:43:33| to try to receive their agreement that this is what the elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| would like and intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| Do they have to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| What I really would like us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| because the essence of when we adopted the slopes and hilltops plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9827)|
| 2:43:55| is we put an amendment on there to be certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| that there would always be an appeals process back to an elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9837)|
| 2:44:01| that was accountable to the Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| or be accountable to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| Because we really have to, I mean, we're the ones that receive the heat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| and we have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| Even though I can see they have the absolute authority to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| and there are some good things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| There are some things in there that gives landowners and property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| developers, and home builders more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| I think we should send a message back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9867)|
| 2:44:35| their appointed members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| that we want to maintain the slopes and hilltop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| being an advisory and non-binding document, a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9883)|
| 2:44:51| Now, they don't have to accept it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| but I think if we send the message back on this as the elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| and what our intentions were when we passed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| I think it would be understood at least where we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| as the representatives of the people, stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| And I'd like to make a substitute motion that we, rather than withdraw it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| that we deny or that we reject the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9913)|
| 2:45:25| The ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| I believe if we did that, there is no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9927)|
| 2:45:33| currently on file, there is no standards, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| So this amendment wouldn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| No, they can still do it. No, they still do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| What you're saying is there's nothing to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| because we don't have regs on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| The subdivision regulations have not been adopted by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9948)|
| 2:45:53| as near as we can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| So there's nothing to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| There's more work to do is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| Well, the state gives the authority to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| rather than to the legislative body to adopt subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| So even if we brought them forward to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| you wouldn't have the authority to adopt them in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| I agree with what he says completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| But I think that what you're wanting to send a message back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| that we don't agree that they should adopt these the way they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| because these are binding and they're binding and they're arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| and it goes beyond the plan that we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| and sent to the planning commission several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=9995)|
| 2:46:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10002)|
| 2:46:46| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| We have a motion, substitute motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10008)|
| 2:46:53| and a second to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10022)|
| 2:47:05| I have a question that relates to something that I do not hear being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| and that's density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| There was an old density and there's a new density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| and it's all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| The subdivision regulations deal with the platting of land into lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| and the setting aside adequate right-of-ways for public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10046)|
| 2:47:31| and establishing standards for those public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10051)|
| 2:47:36| They don't address land use and density issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| I guess I'm just trying to figure out the logistics of this, of action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10067)|
| 2:47:58| Again, I'm just, you know, for us to vote on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10078)|
| 2:48:06| amending something that doesn't exist to our knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| Well, I just don't know if that motion, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| it doesn't seem like this request is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10093)|
| 2:48:19| So, I mean, I think it should probably die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| I mean, if we want to send a message, I think that's what we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| We should craft a letter and vote on whether we want to specifically say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| this is what we want or don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| This just doesn't seem like, from what I hear, that this is even valid for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| to even be voting on either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| I think you're partially correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| This did not have to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| This did not have to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| But it did come to us because, and it was really to have a stamp of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10133)|
| 2:48:58| or a stamp of disapproval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| Quite frankly, it doesn't matter because they have the authority to do it without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| But what they have here is that they can make binding regulations based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10146)|
| 2:49:15| you know, just as it says right here, the Knoxville-Knox County Minimal Subdivision Standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10155)|
| 2:49:22| within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| And what we said with the amendments to the hilltop and the hillside and ridgetop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10165)|
| 2:49:33| is that we didn't want anything to be binding in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10173)|
| 2:49:37| We want it to be advisory, and we want it to be non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| And the way that I would see that working is that a developer, a citizen's group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| and, again, it's always a two-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| It's not that this is protecting development or against citizens or for citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| What it does is that, just as he mentioned here, there's some things that developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10193)|
| 2:49:57| and property owners might like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| You have the opportunity to make more narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| You have the opportunity to maybe have more dense housing because that was part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10203)|
| 2:50:08| And a developer could come forward and said, you know, I want to put, you know, six units per acre on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10208)|
| 2:50:15| I want to have a 20-foot road rather than the presently required 27-foot road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| And you may have a citizen's group that comes here and says, I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| You know, we don't think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| This is not a good place to have a narrow road, and this is not the right place to have too many houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10226)|
| 2:50:32| But they would not have that privilege because this is in subdivision regulations, really, to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10232)|
| 2:50:40| And I know I'm twisting it a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| But on the other hand, you could have a developer who's denied something under the strict binding regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10242)|
| 2:50:54| that in a certain case is that this would be a good thing to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10254)|
| 2:51:00| And what really what I think the message that we want to send is we want flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| and we want the opportunity to appeal this to, you know, to another body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| Now, the truth of the matter is, I mean, that was the intention of the commission, I think, when we passed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10270)|
| 2:51:16| Now, the truth of the matter is that we can go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10276)|
| 2:51:23| and they can say, you know, we disagree with what the elected body says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10283)|
| 2:51:29| because they do have the authority presently to set those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10289)|
| 2:51:33| They don't need to bring them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| But what I would like to do is to send the message back as we go forward on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| is that the initial intent of this body was for the plan to be non-binding and advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10299)|
| 2:51:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10311)|
| 2:51:52| Maybe I'm not articulating it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10314)|
| 2:51:55| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10315)|
| 2:51:56| I actually think we've actually done that by adding your amendment and passing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| That's a pretty clear message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| And I guess what I'm saying is if we want to clarify that even further, we just need to explicitly state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10322)|
| 2:52:10| But this just, again, seems to be kind of a different way of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| And to me, I question whether we're really sending that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10335)|
| 2:52:20| If we want to send a message, we just need to type it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| You know, I think everybody would agree, no matter whether you agree, disagree, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| is that the Tennessee Code annotated that deals with this is not very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| And I think it would be fair to say even when the Metropolitan Planning Commission brought this forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| I don't think you were totally aware that you didn't have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| I mean, you do have a lot more authority than maybe what was thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10362)|
| 2:52:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10367)|
| 2:52:48| I tried to read minds, but you didn't need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| And I really believe that we're going to see action at the state level to try to clarify really what's going to happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10372)|
| 2:53:01| And we did receive a message from one of the state legislators today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| And I think there's others looking at this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10384)|
| 2:53:08| Commissioner McKenzie, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| I guess a couple of items to be hammered on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| And I'd like to call on Deputy Law Director Buch to weigh in on a couple of things here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10397)|
| 2:53:25| I don't know what the intent was of Mr. Donaldson and the staffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10405)|
| 2:53:32| but I think certainly one of the intents were to demonstrate how beneficial these types of recommendations that we beat on forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10412)|
| 2:53:44| could be to developers and to property owners in the process of developing their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10424)|
| 2:53:52| And so when you make things more lenient and less expensive to develop, that means you make more money and more profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10432)|
| 2:54:04| So it's just a logical process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10444)|
| 2:54:08| And then you combine that with the fact that professional planners understand the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10448)|
| 2:54:16| It's not just money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| And they're in favor of it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| I think that's the purpose of bringing this forward, to describe how it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10462)|
| 2:54:30| Still reminded every time I go to our office up there, fellas, when you look out that back window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10470)|
| 2:54:36| that big blue middle finger is still sticking up on top of that ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| And so it's a reminder of what planning, the lack of planning, will produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10480)|
| 2:54:49| The lack of attention to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| I guess I'd like for Mr. Boock to respond to some of Dr. Briggs' assertions about opportunity to appeal non-binding advisory documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10494)|
| 2:55:14| you know, in effect, the Briggs Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10514)|
| 2:55:17| And why is it necessary to deny this rather than withdraw it as a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10517)|
| 2:55:34| Mr. Chairman, I think Commissioner Briggs has correctly stated the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| The sole jurisdiction and power for subdivision regulations lies with the Regional Planning Commission, with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10540)|
| 2:55:48| It does not matter what happens here with regard to subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10548)|
| 2:55:53| When they pass it and duly pass it according to their rules and state law, that becomes a subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10553)|
| 2:56:02| And as he pointed out, it seems like it had always been done bringing it before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10562)|
| 2:56:10| In my 30 years of practicing, a lot of which had to do with rezonings and subdivision regulations and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10570)|
| 2:56:18| I always wondered why they bothered to bring it before commission because they didn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| The appeal rights are set forth under statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| If there is someone that feels aggrieved by the subdivision regulations and finds it or feels that it's arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10588)|
| 2:56:38| and capricious, then they take that action to the chancery court on what's called a certiorari action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10598)|
| 2:56:45| That's the method for the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| And that's set out in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| It's also set out in the subdivision regulations with regard to the section on appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10610)|
| 2:56:57| There are a lot of things that go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| But if you're going to challenge the actual regulation, it's on a cert action to chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10619)|
| 2:57:06| That's by way of history, that's what happened on Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10626)|
| 2:57:11| It was not done exactly according to statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| It was taken up on a cert to the chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| So Commissioner Briggs is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10641)|
| 2:57:26| There are a lot of ways you can send a message, and I wouldn't deign to tell this body how to send a message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| if you want to send a message to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| But insofar as the subdivision regulations, they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10653)|
| 2:57:39| They're passed and they're valid no matter what this body does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10659)|
| 2:57:46| Thank you, Mr. Spook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| I'd like for you to send us a message personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10668)|
| 2:57:52| What would that message be from your legal expertise about the proper process here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10672)|
| 2:58:00| Is it to deny or to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10680)|
| 2:58:05| I leave that up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| If you're denying, you're doing something that I don't think legally you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| because you can't deny something you don't have the power to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10692)|
| 2:58:19| I think the withdrawal is a proper legal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| But that doesn't mean that Commissioner Briggs can't make a motion for this board to rule on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10701)|
| 2:58:28| to send the message to the planning commission itself on what the intent is of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10708)|
| 2:58:37| or the desire of this board or commission, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10717)|
| 2:58:45| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| Let us back up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| Commissioner Briggs, you used the word density that I had just used a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10738)|
| 2:59:05| And the subdivision regulations I thought I heard say does not deal with density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10745)|
| 2:59:12| The only things that are being addressed here are setback, road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10752)|
| 2:59:22| Public improvement standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10764)|
| 2:59:25| See, I can't remember everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| Sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10767)|
| 2:59:28| The reason that I asked that is because I really didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10768)|
| 2:59:33| But if subdivision regulations are different than zoning regulations, zoning controlling density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10773)|
| 2:59:42| then where we sit right now, in my opinion, my interpretation of what Commissioner Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10782)|
| 2:59:52| and Deputy Law Director Mr. Buch have brought to us is that we have nothing before us to act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10792)|
| 3:00:02| So a vote to deny is probably acting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| So I'd rather see us go in a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| Especially if the Knox County legislative delegation is looking at maybe a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10809)|
| 3:00:17| between what is current Tennessee code and what we as citizens of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10817)|
| 3:00:24| would like to see to be the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| Now, I would prefer that they dribble off into the sunset and talk about TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10827)|
| 3:00:38| And should it be changed, apparently we know where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10838)|
| 3:00:43| and that's that we don't really have anything before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10843)|
| 3:00:49| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| I appreciate what you say, Dave, and what our Deputy Law Director says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10852)|
| 3:00:58| And you both are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10858)|
| 3:00:59| The point I was trying to make when I said I was sending a message is that there's going to be other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10859)|
| 3:01:06| some of these the MPC has the authority to act on alone, such as these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10866)|
| 3:01:11| which are, again, going to be binding based on the standards from the hillside and ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10871)|
| 3:01:19| But there's going to be others that do deal with densities and zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10879)|
| 3:01:25| and variances based on the hillside and ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10885)|
| 3:01:30| And the point I was trying to make is when I said send a message, and you're absolutely right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10890)|
| 3:01:35| and the Deputy Law Director is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| We can't act on this because we don't really have the authority to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| But the point I was trying to make is we want to send a message is that we don't want binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10901)|
| 3:01:47| regulations, ordinances, or zoning based on the standards of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10907)|
| 3:01:54| within the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10914)|
| 3:01:59| because the amendment that we put on there said we do want them to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| We agreed that these were worthy of their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10923)|
| 3:02:07| But we don't want binding regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10927)|
| 3:02:11| We want binding ordinances to be derived from those without the right to come before an elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10931)|
| 3:02:19| which is accountable to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| And that was the message that I intended to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| If it's proper to do so, because I'm going to change this now just a little bit from an ordinance to a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10945)|
| 3:02:32| I'd like to withdraw the denial, because I think that probably is not proper to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10952)|
| 3:02:39| because we can't deny something we don't have the authority to do anything with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10959)|
| 3:02:45| But I've got a resolution of somebody who I can't remember who seconded it, but if they'll agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10965)|
| 3:02:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| Now, can I make a, I still have the floor, so I'd like to make a substitute resolution, if that's proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10974)|
| 3:03:01| to send a message to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10981)|
| 3:03:07| is that we do not want, we want that, we want the hillside and ridgetop protection standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10987)|
| 3:03:17| to be advisory and nonbinding, either for subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=10997)|
| 3:03:26| or this is the, let me say the intention of the commission is for the standards that are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11006)|
| 3:03:34| from the hillside and ridgetop protection area to be advisory and nonbinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11014)|
| 3:03:39| We still want them to be, it's okay for us to be considered, but we don't want them to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11019)|
| 3:03:45| and in the future, because they will bring other zoning and other issues and other ordinances before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11025)|
| 3:03:51| but we don't want those to be binding and to be advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11031)|
| 3:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| Let's, if you all don't mind, let's deal with the withdrawal first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| We've got a motion and a second on the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11044)|
| 3:04:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11045)|
| 3:04:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11046)|
| 3:04:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| All right, let's take up the resolution that Dr. Briggs has just brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11050)|
| 3:04:18| Okay, now doesn't that, isn't that a change in our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11058)|
| 3:04:24| That is not an item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11064)|
| 3:04:30| Yeah, it'd probably be better to bring it up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| And I'll say that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| Point accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| Yeah, we'll take that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| Okay, so we're back on the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| We withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| I thought we withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11085)|
| 3:04:46| Okay, so he pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11086)|
| 3:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11087)|
| 3:04:48| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11088)|
| 3:04:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11089)|
| 3:04:50| Before we go further, Ms. Sally Absher, are you in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11090)|
| 3:04:53| Do you want to speak to, you said you get, there's a note here, you want to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11093)|
| 3:04:58| the two items, but do you want to speak now or do you want to wait until we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| the other ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11100)|
| 3:05:01| Let me go ahead and speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| If you could state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| Sally Absher, 5517 River Point Cove in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11105)|
| 3:05:12| I just want to kind of reiterate some of the things that Dr. Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11112)|
| 3:05:17| Obviously, there were two items from MPC on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11117)|
| 3:05:22| You all decided to table, essentially, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11122)|
| 3:05:29| These two items will codify the hillside and ridgetop plan into law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11129)|
| 3:05:37| Current item 4B120A and then the one that's coming up, 0128102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11137)|
| 3:05:44| My request was going to be that you vote both of these MPC items down for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11144)|
| 3:05:51| First of all, I don't have to remind you that the county commission voted down the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| and ridgetop plan twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| It then approved the hillside and ridgetop plan as advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11158)|
| 3:06:02| Codifying the plan into law is not advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11162)|
| 3:06:06| Secondly, the MPC is using an interpretation of TCA 133403 to put the hillside and ridgetop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11166)|
| 3:06:14| plan into law, knowing that this statute has no appeal process to Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11174)|
| 3:06:19| or Knox County Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| That is a violation of due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| I'm asking you to remember your oath to defend the United States Constitution and to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| our due process rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11191)|
| 3:06:35| I'd like to see these items voted down or tabled indefinitely so that Tennessee State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11195)|
| 3:06:41| Legislature can address the due process problems with TCA 133403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11201)|
| 3:06:48| I know you've received letters from two of our legislators, Representative Steve Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| and Senator Stacey Camfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| I also know Senator Becky Massey, who represents my district, informed me that she sent a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11217)|
| 3:07:03| by U.S. mail, snail mail, asking the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| So there is some support for the legislature for y'all to let them do their job and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11227)|
| 3:07:12| codify anything into law at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| Is there anybody else that was going to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| Ms. Clark, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| Okay, the next item is 6-A-12-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11244)|
| 3:07:27| It's a request of Metropolitan Planning Commission to adopt the North County Sector Plan Update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11247)|
| 3:07:32| Commission District 6, 7, and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11259)|
| 3:07:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| Motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11262)|
| 3:07:43| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11266)|
| 3:07:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| Could we have someone give us a thumbnail, two-paragraph, what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11269)|
| 3:08:09| The land use plan is the – I'm sorry, Michael Carver, Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11289)|
| 3:08:15| 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| The land use component, the land use plan looks 15 years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11298)|
| 3:08:24| There's not changes to residential nor the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11304)|
| 3:08:28| One of the major things we did was look at mixed-use districts, such as more at Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11308)|
| 3:08:35| Road where Tenova has come up, focusing on more commercial and office opportunities in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11315)|
| 3:08:43| that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11323)|
| 3:08:44| Also looked at places like Black Oak Ridge Shopping Center, put them in as mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11324)|
| 3:08:49| districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11329)|
| 3:08:50| The old Walmart Center, another one is up at Raccoon Valley Road where the truck stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11330)|
| 3:08:58| were at one point in time the resources that could be much more valuable to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11338)|
| 3:09:03| for economic development purposes, and this plan enables that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11343)|
| 3:09:08| No changes as far as the long-range transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11348)|
| 3:09:12| Still two interchange improvements that will be forthcoming in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11352)|
| 3:09:17| Well, there was one change to the parks plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| That's because the orange route did not go through, and we did have a greenway paralleling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11360)|
| 3:09:26| that particular route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11366)|
| 3:09:30| Is there anybody have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| Did you install any of the hilltop ridge protection plan into this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11372)|

| 3:12:36| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11558)|
| 3:12:39| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11559)|

| 3:12:46| I'll give a second so we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11568)|
| 3:12:49| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| Mr. Donaldson, do you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11573)|
| 3:12:54| This is a recommendation from the Planning Commission to amend the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11574)|
| 3:12:59| zone district to effectively eliminate the minimum front yard requirement whenever it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11579)|
| 3:13:07| not also a peripheral boundary requirement and allow the Planning Commission to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11587)|
| 3:13:14| the minimum front yard at the time of development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11594)|
| 3:13:19| Currently, the Planning Commission has that authority, but there is a minimum 20-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11599)|
| 3:13:26| required front yard established within the zone district, so this amendment would effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11606)|
| 3:13:32| eliminate that minimum requirement and allow it to be determined on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11612)|
| 3:13:38| giving the developer the maximum amount of flexibility available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11618)|
| 3:13:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| Isn't that problematic as far as, you know, future utility growth easements and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11631)|
| 3:13:59| if we, you know, build a Fifth Avenue motel out in the subdivision and we want to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| gas lines and water lines through and we've?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11645)|
| 3:14:08| This provision would apply only within the hillside and ridge stop protection area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11648)|
| 3:14:15| within the planned residential zone district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11655)|
| 3:14:19| I just used that example of how close it is, but it seemed like you would want to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11659)|
| 3:14:24| some kind of setback for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| Most generally, we've provided for a room within the right-of-way even with the narrower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| right-of-ways for all of the utilities to be accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11671)|
| 3:14:36| There were representatives of the utilities on the task force and they all signed off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| on the concept of placing their facilities within the right-of-way, but with development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11681)|
| 3:14:48| plan approval, they get another look at any specific plan and would have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11688)|
| 3:14:54| to establish easements if they're required, which would dictate where the front yard line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11694)|
| 3:15:03| would be, front yard setback would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11703)|
| 3:15:06| I guess I just, I struggle with, you know, I look at it, it was adopted in 1990 and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11706)|
| 3:15:12| look at what was, Commissioner Wright can appreciate this, where was Bell South in 1990| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11712)|
| 3:15:19| and were there in 2012 in terms of, you know, what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| I would just hate to adopt something and there's a technology out there that the folks at KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11723)|
| 3:15:29| and Bell South and Comcast don't necessarily understand and can't appreciate at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| We've potentially backed ourselves into a corner there, so that's just general thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11733)|
| 3:15:42| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11742)|
| 3:15:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11743)|
| 3:15:45| Building on what you're saying, Commissioner McKenzie, this is only in the slope and ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11745)|
| 3:15:53| protected areas, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| Okay, so let me use that word again, density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11755)|
| 3:16:01| This does not affect density either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| No, this would have the effect of eliminating the minimum required front yard and allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11764)|
| 3:16:10| that to be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Planning Commission with development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11770)|
| 3:16:15| plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| And with our development plan approval process, all of the utility companies have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11777)|
| 3:16:24| to weigh in on where they need their facilities if they can accommodate them within the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11789)|
| 3:16:30| But if you eliminate that, it does affect density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11790)|
| 3:16:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| It has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| If you eliminate the front yards, you can stack more people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| The density with a planned residential district is determined by the County Commission with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11803)|
| 3:16:49| the approval of the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11809)|
| 3:16:54| I believe his comment there was about the ballet, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11814)|
| 3:16:59| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11819)|
| 3:17:00| More showing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| So every time you approve a planned residential zone district, you also approve a maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11823)|
| 3:17:10| density that cannot be exceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| You do not determine a minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| And with the exception of the front yard, all of those other setbacks are already determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11836)|
| 3:17:23| by the Planning Commission at the time of development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| So this allows the builder, in the event that there's a building pad that happens to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11847)|
| 3:17:33| in close proximity to the road, to be able to utilize that and set aside larger areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11853)|
| 3:17:41| in other parts of the lot that won't be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| But it won't change the density at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11864)|
| 3:17:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11867)|
| 3:17:48| I think you answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11868)|
| 3:17:49| That's where my question was headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11869)|
| 3:17:50| You just gave the answer in front of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11870)|
| 3:17:55| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| The problem that's before me now is this one is a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11877)|
| 3:18:01| This is an issue before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| And I read again, we've been asked by two state legislators, three state legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11884)|
| 3:18:13| to table this pending their relook at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11893)|
| 3:18:20| Now, we can go in one of two directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11900)|
| 3:18:25| Table this for a month and see where they come back at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11905)|
| 3:18:32| The legislator doesn't come into session until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11912)|
| 3:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| Table it until November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| What was it I used earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| What year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11921)|
| 3:18:42| November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11922)|
| 3:18:47| Well, tabling it would enable us to wait until the legislator did look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11927)|
| 3:18:53| But the way I look at it, the other side of the coin is there is zoning regulation in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11933)|
| 3:19:03| And what this would allow is the MPC to retain density as it's currently established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11943)|
| 3:19:13| and move the building site if it's one per two acres or one per one acre or two per one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11953)|
| 3:19:21| whatever the density is that currently exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11961)|
| 3:19:25| it would allow MPC to move that building site around to a more proper location within the building site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11965)|
| 3:19:38| and help with slope and ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| So I'm straddling the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| I guess I can pass on this one until I see which side is going to have the most votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11984)|
| 3:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11995)|
| 3:19:56| Mr. Dawson, will you speak to the problem that will happen if we table this right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=11996)|
| 3:20:04| According to rezonings that could come forward in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12004)|
| 3:20:09| what is a developer to do if we table this until sometime next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12009)|
| 3:20:16| and they're trying to build something on a slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12016)|
| 3:20:21| If there is no action on this recommended amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12021)|
| 3:20:25| the minimum front yard requirement of 20 feet will stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12025)|
| 3:20:30| And if a proposed development comes through where it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12030)|
| 3:20:38| and the developer wants to locate a building site closer to the road than 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12038)|
| 3:20:44| he would have to get a variance first from the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12044)|
| 3:20:48| and then come back and reflect that on the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| that's considered by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| The planning commission does not have the authority to vary the minimum front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12055)|
| 3:21:02| that's established in the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12062)|
| 3:21:04| So it would require going to two bodies with two applications and two fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12064)|
| 3:21:09| in order to achieve what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12069)|
| 3:21:12| Okay, so again, what we're providing for developers is more leniency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12072)|
| 3:21:18| in terms of the process and evaluation still case by case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12078)|
| 3:21:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12086)|
| 3:21:28| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12088)|
| 3:21:30| I'm really surprised to see Tony's concern for the developers on this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12090)|
| 3:21:40| It's two resolutions in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| I think we ought to give him a certificate or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12102)|
| 3:21:47| But to any extent, we've lived with, if it's been 1990 since the ordinance was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12107)|
| 3:21:54| we've lived with it for 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| I think we could live with it for another eight or nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12116)|
| 3:22:00| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we table this or defer it indefinitely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12120)|
| 3:22:07| give the state legislature a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| One question I did have, and does this particular ordinance here fall under the same category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12129)|
| 3:22:18| that the MPC has the authority to act on that without the commission's approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12138)|
| 3:22:26| or is this one that they would need our approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12146)|
| 3:22:29| No, this is one that they need your approval, because it's an amendment of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12149)|
| 3:22:34| as opposed to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| They've got to have your approval for a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| I think it would be best to defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| You know, we can get some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| I mean, this is pretty important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| I mean, 20 foot's not a lot of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| But I think we ought to still table this or defer this indefinitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| and get more input from other individuals on this rather than trying to vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12171)|
| 3:22:59| I don't know how everyone else feels, but I think that Commissioner Wright may have it correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12179)|
| 3:23:07| and rather than just going ahead and doing this tonight, we may need a little more thought on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12187)|
| 3:23:12| And that's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12192)|
| 3:23:15| A substitute motion is to defer or table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| Defer indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12201)|
| 3:23:22| And second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12202)|
| 3:23:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12203)|
| 3:23:24| Commissioner, you're done, Dr. Boots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12204)|
| 3:23:25| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| I guess now, again, Mr. Book, would you opine on the sub motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12206)|
| 3:23:35| and its legal standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| I think the motion's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| I mean, you can defer the table that I think is a better word than defer indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12222)|
| 3:23:51| I think the Planning Commission has a right to know what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12231)|
| 3:23:57| Certainly, you've got all the power on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12237)|
| 3:24:04| I prefer the language of tabling it for however many months rather than defer indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12244)|
| 3:24:09| That's just way too open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12249)|
| 3:24:12| First and second agree to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12252)|
| 3:24:16| Both agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12256)|
| 3:24:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12257)|
| 3:24:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| We have a motion and a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12264)|
| 3:24:25| Is there anybody in the audience who would like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12265)|
| 3:24:28| Any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12268)|
| 3:24:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12269)|
| 3:24:30| The motion is to table the item, which leaves an indefinite date on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12270)|
| 3:24:33| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12273)|
| 3:24:39| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12279)|
| 3:24:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120827?start=12280)|
