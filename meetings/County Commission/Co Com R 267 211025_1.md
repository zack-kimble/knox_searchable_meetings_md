| 2:46:06| But I have not had a chance to really dive into those specifics yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| as far as the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| But I think it would be beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| but I think there are some negative impacts possibly too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| Ben?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Looking here at KGIS, we're long, narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| about 200 feet average on the width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9993)|
| 2:46:37| Road width right away, Jim, is 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| What would be the right-of-way there for a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10004)|
| 2:46:45| 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| Public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10006)|
| 2:46:47| So we're down to 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| Are you going to have to have some variances on these houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| It depends on where we put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| That's one of the reasons the PR gives us more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| in maybe clustering them away from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| It gives us flexibility in smaller lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| I mean, that's why we went for the PR at four dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| or five dwelling units an acre instead of the RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| because you have to have 10,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| and we could have some larger and smaller lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| or a mix of those in a cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| But we don't have a concept plan really put in place yet to know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| I mean, it may be possible we would need some variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| At this stage, I just don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| Well, if we approve this and you go for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| the variance should be turned down because you're creating your own variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| so you can't create your own variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| I understand that, and that may very well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| I mean, as you know, when you get density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| and you ask for four units an acre, that gives you something you can plan with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10061)|
| 2:47:45| But what actually gets built out is often very less than what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10065)|
| 2:47:51| Even giving us four units an acre, there's no guarantee that would be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| at the use on review or we can even design it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| where that would work once we spend some more time doing the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| Erin has said a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10081)|
| 2:48:02| Even if it's four or three and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10082)|
| 2:48:06| we still may be looking at a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| I'm kind of tossed up on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| But such a narrow lot, unless you build housing straight down one side in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10094)|
| 2:48:19| you're going to have to have a variance, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| And we may be, but again, the PR gives us the flexibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10102)|
| 2:48:27| And I put this in my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| When the family first reached out to planning, they talked about the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10110)|
| 2:48:36| They also talked about the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| and they cited them to a similar piece of property in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10117)|
| 2:48:43| It's very narrow as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| It's a little smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| It's not quite as large and long, but it is as narrow as this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| where they were able to develop five units an acre on that one in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| So I think it can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| but we need to know what we're looking at first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| before we can really even put pen to pencil and design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10140)|
| 2:49:04| I just want to make the point that if you do go for variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10144)|
| 2:49:10| I state the owner's record that you are creating your own variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| I understand completely that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| could you elaborate on why the staff recommended 3.5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10165)|
| 2:49:31| and why possibly the MPC commissioners supported that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10171)|
| 2:49:41| I think that on this one that planning commission supported our analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| on the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10186)|
| 2:49:49| A lot of this is RA that's already been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| and the narrowness of the lot and the challenge with developing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| and then also the concerns that have already been stated specific to flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10195)|
| 2:50:00| But really it was primarily associated with the narrowness of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10200)|
| 2:50:04| and being able to actually develop this in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| that would be compatible with the surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| And at the meeting, did the applicant agree to the 3.5 dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10211)|
| 2:50:21| Well, they were requesting up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10221)|
| 2:50:27| It wasn't necessarily, do you all agree to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| Because I'm looking at the 14-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| I'm thinking that there was some kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10242)|
| 2:50:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10243)|
| 2:50:44| Mr. Snowden, can you help me think through the sidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10244)|
| 2:50:52| as outlined by the community member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| Sorry, I've forgotten your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| And the pictures provided last time I drove out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| I just can't remember that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| but it does look like this is sort of the low point of a two-hill swale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10267)|
| 2:51:13| And I know that when we worked on something on Emory not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| we talked about sidelines and the distance needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10278)|
| 2:51:21| and some of the safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| Are you familiar with this area and what those sideline distances are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| to help me better understand kind of where the hill hits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| Yeah, we looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| I've actually been on this property after some of the conversations previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10291)|
| 2:51:36| It does look like that they can meet on a collector roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| You have to have 300-foot centerline-to-centerline spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10300)|
| 2:51:45| It does appear that if they move the driveway, I guess it would be to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10305)|
| 2:51:50| they can meet that without a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10310)|
| 2:51:54| And in doing so, I think the one lady did mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10314)|
| 2:51:59| there does appear to be some vegetation that would have to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| to meet the sideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| I think this street is posted 30, so we look at 10 times the speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10325)|
| 2:52:12| so we'd be looking for 300 feet in either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| There would have to be some vegetation removed to obtain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| I'm not really sure whether or not that vegetation is on their common frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| or someone else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| But there will have to be a little bit of work completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| to get the adequate line of sight per our office's standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10349)|
| 2:52:36| Okay, thank you, Mr. Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| I've got to tell you, Mr. Mullins, I'm struggling with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| I have always been a pro-growth and development supportive commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10361)|
| 2:52:48| who knows we need inventory and knows we need people to risk capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| to build inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10372)|
| 2:52:55| This is just a weird piece of property, and it's difficult for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10375)|
| 2:53:00| I don't know if any amount of development anywhere in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| is going to solve a flooding issue for Lazy Acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| I think that neighborhood was built inadequately 50 years ago almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10386)|
| 2:53:14| So I don't know if that flooding can work on drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10394)|
| 2:53:18| You can work on pipage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10398)|
| 2:53:19| You can work on ways to mitigate flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10399)|
| 2:53:23| So I don't think that solves it regardless of what development comes in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10403)|
| 2:53:26| It's just this is a weird piece of property that I think if you had real connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10406)|
| 2:53:32| to Martingale and it eased some sightline issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| I'd feel more comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| It's just an unusual one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| So I'm trying to balance the safety side of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10419)|
| 2:53:43| along with the development needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| But I wanted to also hear from our 6th District Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| who may have more engagement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10430)|
| 2:53:55| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10435)|
| 2:54:02| I see no other lights on, so the Chair is going to look to District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10442)|
| 2:54:08| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10448)|
| 2:54:11| To be clear, I do understand that Lazy Acres has had flooding issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10451)|
| 2:54:19| for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| I even spoke with commissioners prior to me that have said that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10462)|
| 2:54:28| that they have struggled with, well, 20, 30, 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10468)|
| 2:54:34| Is that probably your recollection too, Mr. Snowden and Ms. Fowler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10474)|
| 2:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| This is tough, I want to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| I try very hard to support growth and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| kind of like Mr. Jay said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10491)|
| 2:54:59| I've gotten out there, I've driven the line of sight issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10499)|
| 2:55:05| The truth of the matter is right now you have got a couple of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10505)|
| 2:55:11| that are on private property in your subdivision that need to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| that would make a huge difference even in your own, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| entering your own subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| I don't know what we do about that because that's something I would suppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10522)|
| 2:55:26| that falls on the homeowner anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| Is that correct, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| I mean, does the county tell homeowners they have to cut trees down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| Yeah, if the obstruction blocking the sight distance to a public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| identified to be on private property, we'll offer to remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10542)|
| 2:55:49| If they choose not to, we advise them of the liability that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10549)|
| 2:55:55| by choosing, once they've been made aware of the potentially unsafe situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10555)|
| 2:55:59| that they could be held liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| I will say that I do feel like Mr. Mullins and these folks have tried very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10562)|
| 2:56:13| to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| We started with a neighborhood meeting that was actually at Ms. Fowler's home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| months ago, and everyone, you know, came in and talked about what some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10578)|
| 2:56:26| potentials were, some of the possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10586)|
| 2:56:31| I could have lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| I felt like there wasn't legitimate enough reasons to turn the rezoning down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10594)|
| 2:56:41| simply because it does fall within the growth plan, and because of the guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10601)|
| 2:56:48| that flooding will not get worse, I mean, if the flooding's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10608)|
| 2:56:54| Ms. Fowler, this might be something I would ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| What could, if this is approved, what could either Mr. Stone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10617)|
| 2:57:05| or the developer do to, I mean, you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| how are we going to prove if it gets worse or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| Sometimes that's hard when it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10632)|
| 2:57:15| Do you have any thoughts about what would make you feel better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10635)|
| 2:57:19| That is my concern, is I feel like we're going to wind up in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10639)|
| 2:57:24| where we've got 30 additional houses with gutters all pointed at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10644)|
| 2:57:30| During construction, obviously, if we're moving ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| that's going to cause water to run faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| so it's going to come over on us quicker than it already does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| And my concern is it's going to be your word against ours, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| with the issue that we've got, because it is already so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| So that's my main concern about it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| I don't think you can get away with taking off topsoil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| and not causing water to run faster, and it's coming at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10675)|
| 2:58:00| It's already coming at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| I mean, I would love if we could do something now to fix Lacey Acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| whether we put this development in or not next to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| it would be great to have something to mitigate our water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10688)|
| 2:58:14| But we just don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| I mean, we keep calling and emailing Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| As I said, I talked with commissioners who sat here before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| who have said forever and a day they have heard from Lacey Acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| about flooding issues, and I'm sure stormwater's been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10711)|
| 2:58:36| dozens and dozens of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| Ms. Stone, do you have any comment on how there could be a true measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| of if this goes through, how we could know if there, in fact, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10723)|
| 2:58:53| I hear you saying, and I believe you, Jim, because you know more than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10733)|
| 2:58:58| that if this is approved, that it cannot be worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| It cannot be worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10743)|
| 2:59:04| How is that measured when it's already a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| It's very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| I think during construction, Ms. Fowler makes good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| it's hard to, there would be some potential issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10754)|
| 2:59:19| When I talked to the developer, I did mention to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| not only Ms. Fowler's concerns, but our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| I mean, we've had many calls to Lacey Acres in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| and I asked him, you know, there's about 16 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| that drain to the area that is a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10773)|
| 2:59:38| and about two and a half of those 16 are on this development's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10778)|
| 2:59:45| So about 30% of this property drains to that low point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| Drains to Lacey Acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| Yes, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| And the developer did say, at least verbally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| that he would be willing to capture that two and a half acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10797)|
| 3:00:03| and take it to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10803)|
| 3:00:04| Essentially move that water to where two and a half acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10804)|
| 3:00:08| that currently now drains into Lacey Acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| would no longer drain that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| You know, typically our stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| we retain and release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| Well, you know, that maintains pre-development flow rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10817)|
| 3:00:22| but you get more water over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10822)|
| 3:00:25| So we certainly don't want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| these folks already have some water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| We won't try to mitigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10829)|
| 3:00:30| So he was willing, at least verbally, to grade his site such that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10830)|
| 3:00:36| the back two and a half acres that now drains to Lacey Acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10836)|
| 3:00:40| went towards West Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| which has probably a more adequate conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| So he did make that consideration to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10846)|
| 3:00:50| and so I think it would be hard to do during construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10850)|
| 3:00:56| but if he built it in that manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| I think that there could be some potential small improvement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10858)|
| 3:01:03| just potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10863)|
| 3:01:16| I do support, because as I said, just with the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10876)|
| 3:01:24| the three and a half, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| Ms. Fowler and neighbors, if it's going to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10888)|
| 3:01:34| and they're going to put 28 homes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| four more homes are probably not going to make a significant difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10899)|
| 3:01:45| in the amount of soil that's turned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10905)|
| 3:01:49| and as the developer did share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| that gives them a little bit more cushion to be able to try to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10912)|
| 3:01:57| If this were a home of 400 acres, I mean 400 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10917)|
| 3:02:02| and they were asking for that kind of variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| it would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| It would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10926)|
| 3:02:07| I just don't think the difference between 28 and 32 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10927)|
| 3:02:12| is going to matter on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10932)|
| 3:02:17| I do reluctantly move to approve this particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10937)|
| 3:02:31| at the four per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10951)|
| 3:02:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| I have a motion to approve the rezoning for agricultural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10957)|
| 3:02:44| at a density of four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| The second is by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| Commissioner Schoenmacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| Kind of weighing into what Commissioner Jay said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10974)|
| 3:02:57| and the site constraints of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| I'd like to make a substitute motion based on the planning staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10980)|
| 3:03:05| and the planning commission recommendation of 3.5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10985)|
| 3:03:11| and approve the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| I have a substitute motion by Commissioner Schoenmacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| to approve at 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11000)|

| 3:07:33| Mr. Jernigan, just for my clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| when you amended your application with Knox Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| was that because you thought at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| you were going to get an additional parcel of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11260)|
| 3:07:44| Yes, there was a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| The owners of the property, the primary house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11268)|
| 3:07:52| they went ahead and sold their primary residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| out of the transaction, and that's the reason I amended it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| to take that particular piece of property out of the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11282)|
| 3:08:05| Seeing no lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| the Chair will move to Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11287)|
| 3:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11289)|
| 3:08:10| I have to give Mr. Jernigan kudos on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11290)|
| 3:08:15| Not only did he contact me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| but he sent me information that he had written letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11297)|
| 3:08:20| to all of the surrounding neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| let them know what he was thinking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| what the plan might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11305)|
| 3:08:26| If they had any questions, please contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| I told him I was amazed that the Jacksons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11310)|
| 3:08:33| were the only people I did hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11313)|
| 3:08:38| I'm sorry, did I see another hand back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| I only recalled one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| We're next door to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| Oh, all right, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| Well, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11325)|

| 3:08:53| in supporting the three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| So that is the recommendation I'd like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11336)|
| 3:08:59| for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| that it be approved at three dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| I have a motion by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11345)|

| 3:10:07| because it is consistent with the Northwest County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| and surrounding development by a vote of 14-0 consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11410)|

| 3:10:20| Well, I was told by somebody not to say too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| or I end up hanging myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| so we're going to build some more units up your way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11425)|
| 3:10:28| to kind of bring some more development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11428)|
| 3:10:31| towards the Gibbs area, which is growing well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| and we've got sewer and all the other infrastructure in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| and I think that location is a great place for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11437)|
| 3:10:40| Hopefully they'll start widening Emory one of these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11440)|
| 3:10:43| and everything will continue down that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11443)|
| 3:10:46| so we appreciate your support on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11446)|

| 3:10:57| If there is a housing shortage anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| it's certainly in Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11459)|
| 3:11:00| and this is a state highway set to be widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| so I move to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| per the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11465)|

| 3:18:10| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11890)|
| 3:18:15| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| Planning Commission recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| that County Commission approve Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11899)|

| 3:18:28| because of improvements to Level Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| including sidewalks, increased pedestrian connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| in this area by a vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11912)|
| 3:18:36| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| Mr. Mullins, would you like to decipher any of this for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| I can, and I think there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| a little bit more conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11922)|
| 3:18:43| when we get to the rezoning part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11923)|
| 3:18:44| because our application has changed slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11924)|
| 3:18:48| since Planning Commission's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11928)|
| 3:18:49| and I handed out something on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| But the sector plan confirmed earlier this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| that changing the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11935)|
| 3:18:56| to the Mixed-Use Special District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11936)|
| 3:18:59| would be consistent with the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| however we move forward tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| It's an extension across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| It allows a lot of flexibility of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| including the PC and including the OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11948)|
| 3:19:12| and the RA that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| So I would ask that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| per Planning Commission's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11956)|
| 3:19:19| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11959)|
| 3:19:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11960)|
| 3:19:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11961)|
| 3:19:25| Director Brooks, we're not accustomed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| to seeing this broken down this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| Could you give us some guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| as to why now we're receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| five different subsections to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11976)|
| 3:19:40| It's primarily because of the different parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11980)|
| 3:19:47| that are part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11987)|
| 3:19:48| and that they are slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11988)|
| 3:19:53| So you have, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| from one of them is the Zero High Meadow Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| the first Zero High Meadow Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| is going from Office and HP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12001)|
| 3:20:04| to the Mixed-Use Special District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| And then the second is going from LDR and HP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12006)|
| 3:20:10| to the Mixed-Use Special District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| So it's just to provide additional clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| for you all by breaking it down this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| Okay. In the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12017)|
| 3:20:18| we will have things broken down this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| We hope we don't see too many of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| These are quite complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| But yes, we will want to provide clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12026)|
| 3:20:29| to you all as well as in the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| Okay. And one vote satisfies everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12034)|
| 3:20:38| Any other questions or discussion from the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12038)|
| 3:20:42| Chair will look to Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| A motion to approve Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12044)|
| 3:20:50| Amendment to MUSD, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12054)|
| 3:20:55| That is a motion by Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| with a second by Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| to approve per the Planning Commission recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12060)|
| 3:21:03| as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12067)|

| 3:21:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12070)|
| 3:21:11| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12071)|
| 3:21:12| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12072)|

| 3:22:24| Planning Commission recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12144)|
| 3:22:25| that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12145)|
| 3:22:26| PC, Plan, Commercial, slash TO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| technology overlay zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12148)|
| 3:22:29| because it would allow commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| with site plan review at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| by a vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12157)|
| 3:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12158)|
| 3:22:39| I do understand that this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| this cobble of properties, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| is a little bit unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12163)|
| 3:22:44| The owner, the applicant, Mr. Eubanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12164)|
| 3:22:47| owns all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| and he was looking to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12168)|
| 3:22:53| sell this for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| We initially looked at the existing CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| that was across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| but after working with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12180)|
| 3:23:02| and consulting with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12182)|
| 3:23:04| they recommended or thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| that the planned commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12186)|
| 3:23:08| would be more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12188)|
| 3:23:09| because it requires there to be use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12189)|
| 3:23:13| for whatever use ultimately goes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12193)|
| 3:23:16| This is also in the technology overlay corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12196)|
| 3:23:19| and so there's additional design standards in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12199)|
| 3:23:23| and any site plan going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| would have to also go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| the TTCDA approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12208)|
| 3:23:31| So that's why we ultimately asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| that all of these parcels be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12214)|
| 3:23:37| to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12217)|
| 3:23:40| That went through 14-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12220)|
| 3:23:42| and up until a couple weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12222)|
| 3:23:45| I thought that things were going pretty good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| but there is a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12227)|
| 3:23:48| that's looking at this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12228)|
| 3:23:50| and he had the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| there's an existing brick residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| on one of the central parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12235)|
| 3:23:58| That residence can be actually moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12238)|
| 3:24:02| to a different location on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| The far south property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12245)|
| 3:24:08| the Zero Meadows Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12248)|
| 3:24:10| which is currently zoned OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12250)|
| 3:24:12| with a small sliver of it as the RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12252)|
| 3:24:16| he had the idea of potentially moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| the residence to that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| letting that to remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12263)|
| 3:24:26| There is a sinkhole on these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12266)|
| 3:24:30| and so he wanted to carve out the area of the sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12270)|
| 3:24:33| let that sinkhole remain part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| of the planned commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| so that he could work with retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| and detention with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| and then move the house to that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| and allow it to remain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| I reached out to Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| if this was even possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| and in their opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| would this have to go back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12294)|
| 3:24:56| Planning Commission and TTCDA approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12296)|
| 3:24:59| and I believe it was Ms. Brooks' opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| that it would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12302)|
| 3:25:03| that it is what is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| We're actually just removing a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| of what we'd asked for to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| and leaving it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12309)|
| 3:25:13| If we're asking for it to be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| or increasing the footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| then that would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12317)|
| 3:25:18| that would materially change our application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12318)|
| 3:25:20| we'd have to go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12320)|
| 3:25:22| But as it stands now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| and I agree with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12323)|
| 3:25:25| I don't think we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12325)|
| 3:25:26| because we're just carving out a small portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12326)|
| 3:25:29| to let it remain residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12329)|
| 3:25:30| and allows us to save an existing structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12330)|
| 3:25:33| that's already on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| You know, residential in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| is a little difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12337)|
| 3:25:38| because it's right on Lovell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| and so this would move it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12340)|
| 3:25:42| to High Meadows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12342)|
| 3:25:43| where there's an existing residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| I have been in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12346)|
| 3:25:47| with one of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12347)|
| 3:25:51| that owns the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| He's not in objection to the PC zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| He does have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| about the site plan and the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| Of course, that'll get worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12359)|
| 3:26:00| as we go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12360)|
| 3:26:01| and he's already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12361)|
| 3:26:02| he's an architect himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12362)|
| 3:26:03| so he's already given us some very good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12363)|
| 3:26:06| But he's not in opposition of this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12366)|
| 3:26:09| So with the caveat of carving out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12369)|
| 3:26:12| and if we need to capture that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12372)|
| 3:26:15| I think we could probably do a pretty good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| with the plan that I have put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| because it does have elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| to carve out that one piece of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| and then zone the remainder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| the planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12385)|
| 3:26:26| as planning staff and planning commission recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12386)|
| 3:26:31| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12391)|
| 3:26:32| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12396)|
| 3:26:37| so just what portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| is the portion going to touch Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12399)|
| 3:26:42| I'm also the vice chair of TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12402)|
| 3:26:45| and as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| we have specific guidelines on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| different bushes you can plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| I mean, we're really in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| Is that going to touch Hardin Valley as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| the commercial portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12416)|
| 3:26:57| or are you saying you're moving that portion back further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12417)|
| 3:27:00| I'm not even saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12420)|
| 3:27:01| you mean high meadow or level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12421)|
| 3:27:04| Those are the two streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| I guess level, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| Yeah, the commercial portion is level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| and we've asked already for a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| the PC has a 50-foot peripheral setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12434)|
| 3:27:18| and because this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| and the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12440)|
| 3:27:21| and the sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12441)|
| 3:27:22| and it's kind of a jigsaw piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12442)|
| 3:27:23| so we can meet the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| that are at the rear of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| we're asking to move it closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| the setback to 35 feet and level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12451)|
| 3:27:32| That's a variance that's already filed before the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12452)|
| 3:27:35| but the commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12455)|

| 3:27:39| It was the idea to have it fronting level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| which there's, again, commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12461)|
| 3:27:44| planned commercial across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12464)|
| 3:27:45| general commercial across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| so there's already an existing commercial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12467)|
| 3:27:50| in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12472)|

| 3:27:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12477)|
| 3:27:58| Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12478)|
| 3:28:01| do you understand all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12481)|
| 3:28:04| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12484)|
| 3:28:05| So you're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12485)|
| 3:28:06| I didn't understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12486)|
| 3:28:07| so I just hope that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12487)|
| 3:28:09| Yes, and if you all wanted to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| with Mr. Mullen's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| I did jot down what I think would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12493)|
| 3:28:16| an appropriate motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| That would be in the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12498)|
| 3:28:19| because I'm trying to look here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12499)|
| 3:28:20| and see where he's changing from RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12500)|
| 3:28:23| back to office to all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12505)|
| 3:28:29| Any other questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12509)|
| 3:28:32| Chair will look to Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12512)|
| 3:28:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12515)|
| 3:28:38| Mr. Mullins, is that the corner where that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12518)|
| 3:28:41| where another house was that was torn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| and kind of sits up on the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12524)|
| 3:28:46| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12526)|
| 3:28:47| It's the one that sits back up on the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12527)|
| 3:28:48| and there was another residence that's no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12528)|
| 3:28:51| The thought was to preserve that brick residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| that's on up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| Actually, quite honestly, living in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12535)|
| 3:28:58| I think that's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12538)|
| 3:29:01| So I have no problem supporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12541)|
| 3:29:05| and I might look to Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| for the appropriate wording in a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12547)|
| 3:29:11| to support this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12551)|
| 3:29:14| Let me know if this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12554)|
| 3:29:17| So Planning Commission recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12559)|
| 3:29:20| PC plan commercial slash TO technology overlay zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12560)|
| 3:29:23| with the exception of the 2.01 zone portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12563)|
| 3:29:27| depicted on the map as submitted to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| by the applicant to remain zoned OB slash TO and RA slash TO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12569)|
| 3:29:33| because it would allow commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| with site plan review at this location by a vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12575)|
| 3:29:39| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12579)|
| 3:29:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12584)|
| 3:29:45| Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12585)|
| 3:29:46| But doing so, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12586)|
| 3:29:50| that means that 2.01 portion will still qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12590)|
| 3:29:55| under the specific guidelines of the TTCDA, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12598)|
| 3:29:59| It's exempting it from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12599)|
| 3:30:02| I have a motion by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12602)|
| 3:30:05| Commissioner Jay, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12605)|

| 3:30:14| with the noted exception as stated by Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12614)|
| 3:30:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12619)|

| 3:32:42| Maybe just to clarify exactly what it is that we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12762)|
| 3:32:46| This is three parcels that are all owned by the same family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12766)|
| 3:32:50| located on the corner of Hardin Valley Road and Marietta Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12770)|
| 3:32:53| And a portion of the property is zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| Another portion of the property is actually zoned general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12776)|
| 3:33:01| There's about five acres of general business to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12781)|

| 3:33:09| that we're requesting to square up the commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12789)|
| 3:33:15| to the Hardin Valley frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| and to shrink it by about half of what it is that it is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12797)|

| 3:33:35| When is that roundabout supposed to go in, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| We're finalizing the construction plans now, Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12818)|
| 3:33:43| and hopefully have a construction contract in front of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=12823)|

| 3:41:05| We rezoned something from agricultural to RA, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13265)|
| 3:41:10| And it was like 2.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| It's over 2 acres of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| But we didn't put any density to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| That means that they could probably come back to you with a plan, subdivision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13277)|
| 3:41:23| It would not come back before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13283)|
| 3:41:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13285)|
| 3:41:27| Commissioner, are you referring to item number 47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| You all rezoned it to RA, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13291)|
| 3:41:35| And it has dimensional standards built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| So, you don't assign a density to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13297)|
| 3:41:41| So, you don't assign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| But if they want to subdivide it, like she said, all she has to do is make a plan and come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13303)|
| 3:41:48| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13308)|
| 3:41:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13309)|
| 3:41:50| Go through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13310)|
| 3:41:51| If she could go with her RA, you could go, what, 5 units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13311)|
| 3:41:56| Which is a 10,000 square foot minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13316)|

| 3:42:44| And until we take action on the appeal of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13364)|
| 3:42:49| I don't know that we can even entertain item 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13369)|
| 3:42:55| Is there any objection to hearing item 55 first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13375)|

| 3:45:10| may petition the County Commission to consider saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13510)|

| 3:45:47| Yeah, I was just going to say, so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13547)|
| 3:45:49| it was the applicant's responsibility to file a petition to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13549)|
| 3:45:54| And have they done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13554)|
| 3:45:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13557)|
| 3:46:02| I'm not sure I follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| Mr. Javelin, is this appeal not a petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13564)|
| 3:46:11| Mr. J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13571)|
| 3:46:12| I'm thoroughly confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13572)|
| 3:46:13| We spent hours on this last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| and we instructed these applicants to go back and sit down with the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13576)|
| 3:46:23| and then come back to us with two parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13583)|
| 3:46:26| a sector plan amendment and a regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13586)|
| 3:46:30| I mean, they have done exactly what we've asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13590)|
| 3:46:33| to put them through the wringer again on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| I mean, this is an application. This is a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13595)|
| 3:46:38| So, help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13598)|
| 3:46:40| Are we saying that in order to appeal a sector plan amendment denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13600)|
| 3:46:46| they have to go through a different process than simply appealing to Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13606)|
| 3:46:54| Mr. Chairman, what's before the Commission is to hear their appeal can be a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13614)|
| 3:47:02| Yes, yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13624)|
| 3:47:06| And the Metropolitan Planning Commission shall make a report to the County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13626)|
| 3:47:10| which I have, before us, upon all such applications approved by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13630)|
| 3:47:15| but before the enactment of any amendment, I'm just repeating this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13635)|
| 3:47:18| amendment to the zoning resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13638)|
| 3:47:20| the County Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13640)|
| 3:47:24| at least 15 days' notice, the time and place at which it's published in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13644)|
| 3:47:28| general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13648)|
| 3:47:30| This is a publicly noticed meeting, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13650)|
| 3:47:37| Any person or firm or corporation aggrieved by any decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13657)|
| 3:47:45| that would not normally be considered by the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13665)|
| 3:47:50| may petition the County Commission to consider saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13670)|
| 3:47:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13674)|
| 3:47:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13676)|
| 3:47:57| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| I believe they followed the proper procedure by appealing to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13678)|
| 3:48:04| Does that mean, just a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13684)|
| 3:48:08| does that mean that if someone chooses not to go to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13688)|
| 3:48:12| but choose to bring their grievance or appeal to County Commission instead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13692)|
| 3:48:18| I'm sorry, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13698)|
| 3:48:21| Could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| Does that mean if someone chooses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13703)|
| 3:48:28| they can appeal by following that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13708)|
| 3:48:32| something that normally would go to BZA to County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13712)|
| 3:48:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13718)|
| 3:48:40| The statute, the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13720)|
| 3:48:42| sets forth what specific issues and what the jurisdiction of the BZA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13722)|
| 3:48:49| This does not take the place of those specific appeals or issues that go to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13729)|
| 3:48:55| It did say something about what normally would come to Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13735)|
| 3:48:59| Any person or firm or corporation aggrieved by any decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13739)|
| 3:49:06| that would not normally be considered by the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13746)|
| 3:49:10| may petition the County Commission to consider saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13750)|
| 3:49:14| and such a petition shall be in writing and shall state A, B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13754)|
| 3:49:18| This would seem to be a normal procedure, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13758)|
| 3:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13763)|
| 3:49:24| We did meet with Ms. Brooke and Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13764)|
| 3:49:28| Thank you so much for taking the time to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13768)|
| 3:49:31| We learned that that intersection is getting a signal light in the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13771)|
| 3:49:37| You're probably aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| And we consider that to be a major change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13779)|
| 3:49:42| which I think we would respectfully ask to amend the sector plan if that's possible tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13782)|
| 3:49:49| So based on a change in traffic flow, a change in infrastructure, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13789)|
| 3:49:56| because of the installation of a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13798)|
| 3:49:59| They already made a lot of changes as we speak right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13799)|
| 3:50:04| They made the changes to the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13804)|
| 3:50:10| Ms. Brooks, does the staff have an opinion on whether or not a traffic signal constitutes a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13810)|
| 3:50:18| that would fall under the guidelines of a sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13818)|
| 3:50:23| It is something that we would take into consideration to justify a change in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13823)|
| 3:50:31| Are there any questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13831)|
| 3:50:34| I apologize for jumping ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13834)|
| 3:50:36| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13836)|
| 3:50:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13838)|
| 3:50:39| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13839)|
| 3:50:40| What you're going through here said with what was written by our law director with us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13840)|
| 3:50:47| we've asked them to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| It's been on public notice for a long time that this was being appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13849)|
| 3:50:53| Is that what you're saying, what we're doing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13853)|
| 3:50:57| I mean, before we asked them to go back, which was still on their commission agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13857)|
| 3:51:02| which is public record, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13862)|
| 3:51:05| Our agenda is public correct, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13865)|
| 3:51:08| So what you're asking us to do, or not asking but seeing if we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13868)|
| 3:51:13| is go ahead and change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13873)|
| 3:51:16| It's all those steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13876)|
| 3:51:18| It's what you're saying has been taken, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13878)|
| 3:51:23| I'm just reading from 6.40 County Commission Review, the jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13883)|
| 3:51:31| In 6.40.01, any person, firm, or corporation agreed by any decision of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13891)|
| 3:51:39| that would not normally be considered by a county commission-made petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13899)|
| 3:51:43| the county commission considers same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13903)|
| 3:51:45| Such position shall be in writing and shall state with particularity four different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13905)|
| 3:51:53| MPC file number, description of the matter being appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13913)|
| 3:51:57| including the county property map number and parcel and lot number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13917)|
| 3:52:02| C, a statement of the petitioner's interest in the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13922)|
| 3:52:06| and D, a statement of the use and zone desired or opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13926)|
| 3:52:11| including a summary of the zoning of all property located within 300 feet of the subject property, if applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13931)|
| 3:52:18| I'm just reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13938)|
| 3:52:22| So what part of that have they not fulfilled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13942)|
| 3:52:37| That's for you to determine, I'm afraid, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13957)|
| 3:52:42| So we decide if they've fulfilled those obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13962)|
| 3:52:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13967)|
| 3:52:49| So we go down the list and see if they have, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13969)|
| 3:52:55| All I'm doing is reading from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13975)|
| 3:53:00| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13980)|
| 3:53:02| Verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13982)|
| 3:53:07| It's the opinion of the chair that they have gone through the proper procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13987)|
| 3:53:12| Commissioners can disagree if you wish, but it is the opinion of the chair that they followed the proper procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13992)|
| 3:53:17| Thank you, Mr. Jett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=13999)|
| 3:53:20| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14000)|
| 3:53:21| I think that these applicants have done everything we've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14001)|
| 3:53:24| They sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14004)|
| 3:53:25| We have infrastructure that is being improved in the area, which would support a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14005)|
| 3:53:32| This is clearly a commercial area with used car dealers, power equipment, dollar general equipment operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14012)|
| 3:53:40| and right along the stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| I'm going to defer to the district commissioner for a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14024)|
| 3:53:47| but I hope we will support small businesses having an opportunity to not get run through the wringer anymore on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14027)|
| 3:53:55| and find a way to start their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14035)|
| 3:53:59| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14039)|
| 3:54:02| Did they actually apply to have the change, and did they actually say planning zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14042)|
| 3:54:13| I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14053)|
| 3:54:15| Did they actually apply for this, or are we just assuming denial from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14055)|
| 3:54:22| For the zoning, not for the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14062)|
| 3:54:25| For both is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| They applied for both, and they got denied for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14067)|
| 3:54:29| 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14069)|
| 3:54:30| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14070)|
| 3:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| So planning said we don't think the sector plan change is a good idea, 15-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14072)|
| 3:54:38| and because of that we also then don't think that the zoning change is effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14078)|
| 3:54:43| Yes, that's the whole point I'm making, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14083)|
| 3:54:46| They said 15-0, we don't think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14086)|
| 3:54:49| That's what I'm trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14089)|
| 3:54:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14091)|
| 3:54:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14092)|
| 3:54:53| Commissioner Schmidt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14093)|
| 3:54:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14094)|
| 3:54:55| Director Brooks, I'm going to try to state if we want to accomplish something of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14095)|
| 3:55:01| that I think we've taken before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14101)|
| 3:55:03| We can't do anything about the zoning right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14103)|
| 3:55:06| but if we as a commission body feel that this sector plan denial from MPC was incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14106)|
| 3:55:14| we can initiate a sector plan change and send that back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14114)|
| 3:55:19| Then it will come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14119)|
| 3:55:21| Then we can address both of these issues at one time if it comes back and we agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14121)|
| 3:55:26| The reason that you are seeing the sector plan accompany this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14126)|
| 3:55:30| it's because in the past I don't know why the sector plans didn't get sent forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14130)|
| 3:55:36| because they're considered along with the rezoning at Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14136)|
| 3:55:39| but you all have only seen the rezonings in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| But I have found no indication in any ordinance that would prevent you all from acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14141)|
| 3:55:48| on the sector plan request, the denial that was part of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14148)|
| 3:55:52| And so that is why you're seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| It was properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14155)|
| 3:55:56| It was put in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| There was a sign posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| And so in the future, you should see these together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14160)|
| 3:56:05| because they come together to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| But in order for us to change the sector plan, we can't do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14167)|
| 3:56:12| We have to send it back to MPC and then it come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14172)|
| 3:56:15| Is that not the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14175)|
| 3:56:16| That's not my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14176)|
| 3:56:17| I'll defer to the law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| But the Planning Commission has already considered the plan amendment request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14179)|
| 3:56:24| They've already considered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14184)|
| 3:56:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14186)|
| 3:56:28| To amend the sector plan, you're correct, Mr. Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14188)|
| 3:56:33| this commission decides to do it and it goes back to the Planning Commission to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14193)|
| 3:56:40| And if they turn it down, then it comes back and you have a majority vote there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14200)|
| 3:56:45| That's to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| Commissioner Daly, some of the guys that have been here a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14207)|
| 3:56:51| I believe that's how we've handled this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| Whenever somebody had a sector plan that was turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14213)|
| 3:56:56| denied that we thought should have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14216)|
| 3:57:00| we send it back to MPC for them to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14220)|
| 3:57:03| They'll probably vote it down again and they bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14223)|
| 3:57:06| And at that point, we can do what we wish with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14226)|
| 3:57:09| Isn't that what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14229)|
| 3:57:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14231)|
| 3:57:13| That happened a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14233)|
| 3:57:16| And we, instead of denying them, we send it back for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14236)|
| 3:57:22| With their new information that they got, it's possible that they may have a different vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14242)|
| 3:57:28| because there's new information that's been added that wasn't there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14248)|
| 3:57:32| So I agree with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14252)|
| 3:57:34| If we need to send it back, let them vote on it, then we can approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14254)|
| 3:57:39| Commissioner Jay, what they've been sending to us is the zoning appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14259)|
| 3:57:44| not the sector plan appeal also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14264)|
| 3:57:46| Well, no, 55 says this is a sector plan appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14266)|
| 3:57:50| Right, that's the first time it's came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14270)|
| 3:57:51| That's the first time a sector plan's been before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14271)|
| 3:57:56| It was already voted against in the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14276)|
| 3:58:01| so it's already got voted on by them once, so it's come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14281)|
| 3:58:05| But they didn't send the sector plan appeal along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14285)|
| 3:58:10| What we've been looking for in the past was just the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14290)|
| 3:58:15| which we can't change that if the sector plan doesn't match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14295)|
| 3:58:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14299)|
| 3:58:22| I would ask the law director where in the code it states that we can't send forward the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14302)|
| 3:58:27| along with the rezonings because they're considered together at planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14307)|
| 3:58:31| The planning commission has already deliberated on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14311)|
| 3:58:34| And I know in the past you all have only seen the rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14314)|
| 3:58:37| but we as planning staff have been able to find no place in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14317)|
| 3:58:42| or any of our administrative rules that would prevent you all from considering them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14322)|
| 3:58:46| as the planning commission had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14326)|
| 3:58:51| Are you saying you think we can change the sector plan here tonight without sending it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14331)|
| 3:58:56| I do. You are the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14336)|
| 3:58:58| I believe you all have the final say, and the planning commission has already deliberated on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14338)|
| 3:59:03| If I may just ask a clarifying question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14343)|
| 3:59:08| are we saying that a sector plan essentially has to be appealed twice before this body can overrule it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14348)|
| 3:59:16| No. The way it's worked in the past is a sector plan was heard at MPC, denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14356)|
| 3:59:24| They appealed it to us, re-requested that MPC go back and look at that sector plan and change that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14364)|
| 3:59:32| Then it goes back before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14372)|
| 3:59:35| On several occasions they failed it again, but it was brought back before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14375)|
| 3:59:41| and at that point we were able to do what the legislative body should be able to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14381)|
| 3:59:46| and that is impose its will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14386)|
| 3:59:48| But it does have to come to us twice before we can do that essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14388)|
| 3:59:51| Well, that's the way it's worked in the past with Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14391)|
| 3:59:53| Zonings don't, so I'm just asking that for my own personal...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14393)|
| 3:59:59| Commissioner Hill, you've not weighed in on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14399)|
| 4:00:06| I don't believe in all the times that these folks have come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14406)|
| 4:00:11| that there's ever been one person to express any reason for it not to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14411)|
| 4:00:22| I'm talking about their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14422)|
| 4:00:24| Anybody's had any objection along the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14424)|
| 4:00:29| Am I recalling that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14429)|
| 4:00:33| There was one objection from Knox Planning Alliance, not in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14433)|
| 4:00:37| but there was an objection that the sector plan was not being followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14437)|
| 4:00:40| if the rezoning was true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14440)|
| 4:00:42| And I hear that, but I'm talking about just in premise that they were wanting to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14442)|
| 4:00:48| and all the friends and neighbors and everything were all right with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14448)|
| 4:00:53| You know, sometimes you just have to get a little gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14453)|
| 4:00:56| You just do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14456)|
| 4:01:00| Yeah, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14460)|
| 4:01:01| I don't think Knox Planning requires the applicant to post an appeal sign on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14461)|
| 4:01:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14469)|
| 4:01:13| I apologize, the appeal sign...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14473)|
| 4:01:14| In other words, because they appealed the original rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14474)|
| 4:01:17| they are not required to post a sign on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14477)|
| 4:01:20| that the property is being up for an appeal by Knox Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14480)|
| 4:01:25| You guys are not requiring the applicant to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14485)|
| 4:01:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14488)|
| 4:01:29| They posted a sign, and you posted another...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14489)|
| 4:01:32| For the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14492)|
| 4:01:33| For the appeal, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| Okay, so it has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14495)|
| 4:01:36| Yes, it has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14496)|
| 4:01:41| And then the other thing, which I also recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14501)|
| 4:01:43| and then the other thing I was reading in what the law director had posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14503)|
| 4:01:47| was that it says that the person who's agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14507)|
| 4:01:52| has to issue a statement of the use or the zone desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14512)|
| 4:01:58| We have not gotten any use of what this property has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14518)|
| 4:02:02| You know, the first meeting we had, it was supposed to be a contractor yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14522)|
| 4:02:06| Last month, it was changed to where the relatives, the sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14526)|
| 4:02:11| are into the car business, and they may want to sell used cars on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14531)|
| 4:02:15| once they fix them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14535)|
| 4:02:16| So we've never really gotten a statement from the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14536)|
| 4:02:19| of actually what they want to do on this property in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14539)|
| 4:02:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14544)|
| 4:02:27| Commissioner...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14547)|
| 4:02:31| Commissioner Daly, his light's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14551)|
| 4:02:34| We'll go with Commissioner Bussler first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14554)|
| 4:02:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14557)|
| 4:02:40| These people have been before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14560)|
| 4:02:43| We've instructed them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14563)|
| 4:02:46| We said you need to go back, and you need to work with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14566)|
| 4:02:51| and Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14571)|
| 4:02:55| Come back, and we sent them back again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14575)|
| 4:02:59| and said we needed to have this before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14579)|
| 4:03:04| And now we're going to say, well, we've got to do one more step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14584)|
| 4:03:10| But I think they followed the steps that what the law director has told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14590)|
| 4:03:15| that would cause us to be able to take an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14595)|
| 4:03:19| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| Am I not understanding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14601)|
| 4:03:25| The ordinance requires certain steps to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14605)|
| 4:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14608)|
| 4:03:29| As I've read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14609)|
| 4:03:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14610)|
| 4:03:31| In 6.40 County Commission Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14611)|
| 4:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14614)|
| 4:03:35| And our chairman has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14615)|
| 4:03:39| in his belief, what he's telling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14619)|
| 4:03:41| that they have met those requirements, correct, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14621)|
| 4:03:46| I believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14626)|
| 4:03:48| So here we are again, and we're going to tell them to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14628)|
| 4:03:52| We know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14632)|
| 4:03:54| It's going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14634)|
| 4:03:57| And that'll do another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| But they've done everything that we've asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14639)|
| 4:04:03| and then we find out there's something else, another step you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14643)|
| 4:04:09| We can run these people around the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14649)|
| 4:04:11| I don't know until they finally get so daggone disgusted with us that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14651)|
| 4:04:17| you know, we've got to take an action one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14657)|
| 4:04:20| I think we put them through that too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14660)|
| 4:04:25| And to be representative of the people, we need to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14665)|
| 4:04:29| If they've done what we've asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14669)|
| 4:04:31| we ought to be able to do, if we're going to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14671)|
| 4:04:35| where we reverse the sector plan where they said they denied it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14675)|
| 4:04:40| we're going to reverse that decision, and we ought to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14680)|
| 4:04:44| And if we're going to deny the rezoning, if we're going to reverse that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14684)|
| 4:04:50| then we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14690)|
| 4:04:52| But if you're going to send it back one more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14692)|
| 4:04:54| I don't think that's fair to them or anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14694)|
| 4:04:57| because we know what's going to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14697)|
| 4:05:00| So I want to call for a question on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14700)|
| 4:05:07| I want to make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14707)|
| 4:05:11| How do I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14711)|
| 4:05:14| I want to approve the sector plan as requested by the applicants to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14714)|
| 4:05:24| Motion is by Commissioner Bussler to approve the sector plan denial appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14724)|
| 4:05:32| Second by Commissioner Hill. Commissioner Daley, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14732)|
| 4:05:35| Yeah, first of all, you've got to have a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| You just can't say you want to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14737)|
| 4:05:40| You've got to go in that list and find that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14740)|
| 4:05:43| So if you can find the reason, you know, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14743)|
| 4:05:48| We have said, like Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14748)|
| 4:05:50| we had set a precedent that we had sent these back before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14750)|
| 4:05:55| We have done it on a couple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14755)|
| 4:05:59| Our rules that we just went through that will come before us next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14759)|
| 4:06:04| we won't have this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14764)|
| 4:06:06| But I agree, this should have been come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14766)|
| 4:06:09| It did not come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14769)|
| 4:06:12| So our rules will address this in November when we approve the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14772)|
| 4:06:16| because that's what we talked about in the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14776)|
| 4:06:20| Are we going to change our precedent that we had on two other occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14780)|
| 4:06:26| the tools being the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14786)|
| 4:06:29| and have making them go back and going through the voting process again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14789)|
| 4:06:35| just because now we see that since this was messed up in the beginning anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14795)|
| 4:06:42| we're going to try to correct it right here and right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14802)|
| 4:06:45| I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| I would vote no on that one because I think we set a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| and we need to keep following that precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14811)|
| 4:06:54| and it will be up to the applicant when they go back to make the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14814)|
| 4:07:01| is a traffic lot justification to change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14821)|
| 4:07:06| That's for planning to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14826)|
| 4:07:08| That's for those planning commissioners to decide first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14828)|
| 4:07:13| Then it comes to us, and if they say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14833)|
| 4:07:17| that that traffic lot and that turning lane that's going to go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14837)|
| 4:07:20| is not justification for a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14840)|
| 4:07:23| then we can overrule it at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14843)|
| 4:07:27| I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14847)|
| 4:07:30| We've already set a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14850)|
| 4:07:32| Our rules are going to say that it's got to come together in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14852)|
| 4:07:37| if we approve those rules, so why should we change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14857)|
| 4:07:44| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14864)|
| 4:07:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14869)|
| 4:07:51| I think that this was messed up from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14871)|
| 4:07:54| This was messed up by how it came to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14874)|
| 4:07:56| the process, and there are times where we have to right some wrongs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14876)|
| 4:08:02| and we have to do things a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14882)|
| 4:08:04| to help people thrive in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14884)|
| 4:08:06| I agree with Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14886)|
| 4:08:08| We ought to take action with the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14888)|
| 4:08:11| I know the planning commission has already denied it once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| but I don't want to put our applicants through another whole round of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14893)|
| 4:08:17| when we can look at it and make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14897)|
| 4:08:19| We are ultimately the legislative body that makes the decisions on land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14899)|
| 4:08:23| Let's make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14903)|
| 4:08:24| Let's let these people go to work and move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14904)|
| 4:08:26| and if our rules change it next time, great, we'll clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14906)|
| 4:08:30| But this was sort of jacked up from the minute it walked in the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14910)|
| 4:08:33| and now we're sort of at a turning point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14913)|
| 4:08:36| We can either disenfranchise some folks trying to build a small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14916)|
| 4:08:40| or we can go back through and add lower layers of bureaucracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14920)|
| 4:08:43| and I think we should just take care of it and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14923)|
| 4:08:46| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14926)|
| 4:08:52| I've got a mix of emotions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14932)|
| 4:08:53| I agree with Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14933)|
| 4:08:55| I agree with Commissioner Jay both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14935)|
| 4:08:59| I agree with you, Commissioner Buehler and the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14939)|
| 4:09:01| that I think they've met all the criteria to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14941)|
| 4:09:05| On the actual use of the property, away from the procedural part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14945)|
| 4:09:12| I have a hard time, like Commissioner Daly said, approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14952)|
| 4:09:17| where it's like, as a real estate guy myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14957)|
| 4:09:22| is this at the president's that you can go and buy any commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14962)|
| 4:09:26| and then come here and say, well, I want this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14966)|
| 4:09:29| and then we just change it because that's what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14969)|
| 4:09:32| If that was the case, I would go right now before this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14972)|
| 4:09:35| and ask you to change a dozen of my properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14975)|
| 4:09:37| to make them more valuable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14977)|
| 4:09:39| That's kind of what we're saying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14979)|
| 4:09:41| Like, all right, you can buy a neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14981)|
| 4:09:44| but then you upzone it to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14984)|
| 4:09:46| You can actually put, like, my garbage company can now go on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14986)|
| 4:09:50| if we do this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14990)|
| 4:09:52| Is that what that community wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14992)|
| 4:09:54| This is the part that I'm kind of having a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| There's a reason why we have the overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14996)|
| 4:09:58| which I a lot of times don't even agree with myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=14998)|
| 4:10:01| I think it's communist in some degree, but that's besides my personal feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15001)|
| 4:10:07| You know, there's a reason why, and I get that reason sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15007)|
| 4:10:12| So I am struggling with this on both sides and on all fronts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15012)|
| 4:10:16| but as a property investor and developer myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15016)|
| 4:10:23| we're sitting in a dangerous, slippery slope where you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15023)|
| 4:10:27| all right, these guys, because the system got screwed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15027)|
| 4:10:31| we're going to give them a free pass and just upzone a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15031)|
| 4:10:35| that's not projected for what we've decided as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15035)|
| 4:10:39| as our future plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15039)|
| 4:10:42| So that's really where when we get down to the actual property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15042)|
| 4:10:45| where I'm having some struggle with here, because I don't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15045)|
| 4:10:49| if that's the case, you'll see me here next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15049)|
| 4:10:51| and say, guys, increase all my properties that I own that are commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15051)|
| 4:10:56| So that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15056)|
| 4:10:59| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15059)|
| 4:11:00| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15060)|
| 4:11:01| Is it wrong to ask for flexibility of a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15061)|
| 4:11:07| Would you all need to know exactly what will happen on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15067)|
| 4:11:11| That wasn't my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15071)|
| 4:11:13| My point is it doesn't matter what you put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15073)|
| 4:11:16| It's that zonings give property value, whether you like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15076)|
| 4:11:22| We're talking about the value of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15082)|
| 4:11:24| and what money you can make off that property to some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15084)|
| 4:11:27| and what functionality the property can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15087)|
| 4:11:29| Once you start changing the zoning of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15089)|
| 4:11:32| like we always have the discussion here on density for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15092)|
| 4:11:35| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| So we set as a community a precedence, a vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15097)|
| 4:11:43| of what we want our community to develop and look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15103)|
| 4:11:46| Once we start denying that vision that we've already laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15106)|
| 4:11:51| then you start a slippery slope of, well, why you and not me or them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15111)|
| 4:11:57| or so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15117)|
| 4:12:00| As a – my libertarian mindset is like, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15120)|
| 4:12:03| you go build whatever you want on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15123)|
| 4:12:04| You own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15124)|
| 4:12:05| It's yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15125)|
| 4:12:06| That's how I personally feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15126)|
| 4:12:07| Have you been up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| Yes, but I have an obligation to uphold the law and the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15129)|
| 4:12:12| and everything else, even though I don't personally agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15132)|
| 4:12:16| So if it's up to me, I would just say build whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15136)|
| 4:12:19| It's your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15139)|
| 4:12:20| You should have the freedom to do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15140)|
| 4:12:22| But we're a country of laws, so that's the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15142)|
| 4:12:26| and I'm elected to uphold the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15146)|
| 4:12:29| I'm not elected to be the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15149)|
| 4:12:31| and tell you what you should or shouldn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15151)|
| 4:12:33| So that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15153)|
| 4:12:35| I have a personal struggle with this as an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15155)|
| 4:12:38| because how I personally feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15158)|
| 4:12:40| and what my legal and professional obligations are are conflicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15160)|
| 4:12:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15167)|
| 4:12:49| May I defer to Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15169)|
| 4:12:52| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15172)|
| 4:12:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15173)|
| 4:12:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15177)|
| 4:13:00| I just want to know what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15180)|
| 4:13:02| We have a law director here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15182)|
| 4:13:04| We have the director of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15184)|
| 4:13:07| and nobody can tell us what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15187)|
| 4:13:11| I remember the last time we were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15191)|
| 4:13:14| I thought we were going to send back and ask for a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15194)|
| 4:13:18| but I was told you don't have the sector plan amendment in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15198)|
| 4:13:22| You have the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15202)|
| 4:13:23| So they come back with both of them this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15203)|
| 4:13:27| Mr. Law Director, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15207)|
| 4:13:30| can you all tell us what our process is for changing the sector plan from this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15210)|
| 4:13:38| I'll start, and then I'll defer to Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15218)|
| 4:13:43| It's always been a question of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15223)|
| 4:13:46| or at least for the last several years, of how appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15226)|
| 4:13:50| You all do not get a lot of appeals from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15230)|
| 4:13:52| but there have been a few over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15232)|
| 4:13:55| where the process is outlined where you send the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15235)|
| 4:13:58| and you don't send the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15238)|
| 4:14:00| So our staff has done some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15240)|
| 4:14:02| We have not been able to find anywhere in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15242)|
| 4:14:05| the Knox County Code, or our administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15245)|
| 4:14:08| or the county commission's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15248)|
| 4:14:11| that would require that only the rezoning is sent forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15251)|
| 4:14:16| and not the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15256)|
| 4:14:19| So with that, why would we not send them both forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15259)|
| 4:14:24| Because the county commission has considered them both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15264)|
| 4:14:27| and you all are the legislative body and have the final say on both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15267)|
| 4:14:30| I get that, but what does your rules, the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15270)|
| 4:14:34| say about the process for county commission to initiate a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15274)|
| 4:14:48| Because I want to help these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15288)|
| 4:14:50| but I want to make sure we can do it in a legally defendable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15290)|
| 4:14:54| Just because we feel like we want to help people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15294)|
| 4:14:57| doesn't mean we don't have to follow our own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15297)|
| 4:15:13| I'll have to look in the code specifically for county commission's authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15313)|
| 4:15:17| but it's my understanding that you all have the authority to initiate a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15317)|
| 4:15:28| I could show up here at next month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15328)|
| 4:15:31| and say I want to change a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15331)|
| 4:15:35| and we would vote to send it to the MPC for them to consider, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15335)|
| 4:15:42| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15342)|
| 4:15:43| I think the confusion comes from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15343)|
| 4:15:45| because the planning commission has already considered the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15345)|
| 4:15:49| The applicant actually initiated the sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15349)|
| 4:15:52| and the planning commission denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15352)|
| 4:15:55| This body, I would think, has the authority to overrule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15355)|
| 4:15:59| Mr. Morton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| I was going to read from Tennessee law that's sort of an outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15361)|
| 4:16:04| of what we have to follow, 13-7-105,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15364)|
| 4:16:07| amendments to zoning ordinance provisions procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15367)|
| 4:16:11| The county legislative body may, from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15371)|
| 4:16:14| amend the number, shape, boundary, area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15374)|
| 4:16:17| or any other regulation of or within any district or district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15377)|
| 4:16:21| or any provision of any zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15381)|
| 4:16:25| But any such amendment shall not be made or become effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15385)|
| 4:16:29| unless the same be first submitted for approval, disapproval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15389)|
| 4:16:33| or suggestions to the regional planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15393)|
| 4:16:37| of the region in which the territory is covered by the ordinance is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15397)|
| 4:16:42| And if such regional planning commission disapproves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15402)|
| 4:16:46| within 30 days after such submission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15406)|
| 4:16:49| such amendment shall require the favorable vote of a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15409)|
| 4:16:52| of the entire membership of the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15412)|
| 4:16:57| B, prior to adopting an amendment as authorized under subsection A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15417)|
| 4:17:01| the county legislative body shall hold a public hearing on the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15421)|
| 4:17:05| with at least 15 days' notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| the time and place to be given by at least one publication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15427)|
| 4:17:10| in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15430)|
| 4:17:13| A complete summary of the amendment shall be published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15433)|
| 4:17:16| at least once in the official newspaper of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15436)|
| 4:17:20| or in a newspaper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15440)|
| 4:17:22| The summary shall include a statement that a complete copy of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15442)|
| 4:17:27| is available and where copy may be obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15447)|
| 4:17:30| If the zoning ordinance rezones property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15450)|
| 4:17:33| a description of the property that is rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| shall be included in the summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15455)|
| 4:17:40| TCA 13-7-105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15460)|
| 4:17:42| Thank you, Mr. Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15462)|
| 4:17:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15464)|
| 4:17:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15467)|
| 4:17:50| I guess the problem I have with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15470)|
| 4:17:55| is that the applicant purchased the land on February 1 of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15475)|
| 4:18:04| knowing that it was zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15484)|
| 4:18:08| Had they considered buying property for commercial enterprises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15488)|
| 4:18:13| they would have done, like everyone else that comes to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15493)|
| 4:18:17| and to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| and got an option to purchase the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15499)|
| 4:18:22| pending the outcome of any zoning situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15502)|
| 4:18:26| Well, they went to Knox Planning and they got denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15506)|
| 4:18:30| If they'd had an option on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15510)|
| 4:18:32| they would have gone where else and bought other property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15512)|
| 4:18:36| that they could have used for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15516)|
| 4:18:39| What concerns me now is we are trying to reformulate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15519)|
| 4:18:46| so that they can have this property for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15526)|
| 4:18:50| And I'm really concerned that down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15530)|
| 4:18:53| that this body will be looking at a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15533)|
| 4:18:56| because we've changed what our procedures are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15536)|
| 4:19:00| to make special dispensation for one applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15540)|
| 4:19:05| when it was their responsibility to start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15545)|
| 4:19:09| when they bought the property or had an option on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15549)|
| 4:19:12| what they were going to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15552)|
| 4:19:14| And to this day, we still haven't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15554)|
| 4:19:16| what exactly is going on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15556)|
| 4:19:18| that they want us to jump through hoops for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15558)|
| 4:19:21| So I have a real problem trying to give somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15561)|
| 4:19:24| that's been denied at Knox Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15564)|
| 4:19:27| the opportunity to change the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15567)|
| 4:19:30| and the rezoning to accomplish something for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15570)|
| 4:19:33| when they didn't do their due diligence to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15573)|
| 4:19:37| And again, I just don't want to see us, this body down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15577)|
| 4:19:42| be sued for taking this kind of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15582)|
| 4:19:47| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15587)|
| 4:19:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15591)|
| 4:19:55| The motion that was made is not, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15595)|
| 4:19:59| is not a good motion because it does not state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15599)|
| 4:20:02| the reason to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15602)|
| 4:20:04| You've got to have a reason to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15604)|
| 4:20:08| Under the, here, number three says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15608)|
| 4:20:12| even though it talks about the red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15612)|
| 4:20:16| and the right-hand turning lane on Roberts Road here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15616)|
| 4:20:19| number three says, since the GC land use class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15619)|
| 4:20:22| as existing commercial strips should be created or extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15622)|
| 4:20:27| any additional roads or utilities would not warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15627)|
| 4:20:32| amending the land use plan to GC land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15632)|
| 4:20:36| It's telling you right here, even though there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15636)|
| 4:20:40| I read it just a few minutes ago, I didn't know, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15640)|
| 4:20:44| even here, even a red light does not generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15644)|
| 4:20:47| a sector plan change for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15647)|
| 4:20:50| We can still go neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15650)|
| 4:20:52| which I asked them to go neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15652)|
| 4:20:54| and go for a variance, and they were told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15654)|
| 4:20:57| they told us that they'd want to go commercial or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15657)|
| 4:21:01| So now we're in a box because they want to go commercial or nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15661)|
| 4:21:05| because they want to do a car lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15665)|
| 4:21:07| that is not in neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15667)|
| 4:21:11| So the motion that, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15671)|
| 4:21:14| the motion that was put forward by the laws that we've got to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15674)|
| 4:21:18| is not a good motion, is that, am I wrong there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15678)|
| 4:21:26| Mr. Chairman, I refer to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15686)|
| 4:21:30| first I refer to the MPC's decision on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15690)|
| 4:21:36| on page 19.2 that describes, it's TCA 3304,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15696)|
| 4:21:43| state law regarding amendments to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15703)|
| 4:21:46| which includes sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15706)|
| 4:21:49| And it says, the law now provides two methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15709)|
| 4:21:52| to amend the plan at TCA 133304.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15712)|
| 4:21:56| And I've got the statute pulled up, but this summary is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15716)|
| 4:22:02| The planning commission may initiate an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15722)|
| 4:22:04| by adopting a resolution and certifying the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15724)|
| 4:22:07| to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15727)|
| 4:22:09| Once approved by a majority vote of the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15729)|
| 4:22:12| the amendment is operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15732)|
| 4:22:14| Second, the legislative body may also initiate an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15734)|
| 4:22:18| and transmit the amendment to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15738)|
| 4:22:22| Once the planning commission has considered the proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15742)|
| 4:22:25| and approved, not approved, or taken action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15745)|
| 4:22:27| the legislative body may approve the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15747)|
| 4:22:29| By a majority vote, the amendment is operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15749)|
| 4:22:37| That is an accurate summary of the two-page statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15757)|
| 4:22:42| that it references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15762)|
| 4:22:44| Director Brooks, when a sector plan is brought before planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15764)|
| 4:22:50| the planning commissioner that makes a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15770)|
| 4:22:53| to approve a sector plan change has to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15773)|
| 4:22:57| what condition is met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15777)|
| 4:22:59| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15779)|
| 4:23:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15780)|
| 4:23:01| Sometimes we need to remind them that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15781)|
| 4:23:03| we have to have a rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15783)|
| 4:23:05| And we've got to state it the same here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15785)|
| 4:23:07| what condition has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15787)|
| 4:23:10| We're no different than they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15790)|
| 4:23:12| I think Mr. Smith is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15792)|
| 4:23:14| We need to send it back and let them look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15794)|
| 4:23:28| Does the maker of the motion want to amend your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15808)|
| 4:23:31| to give a stipulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15811)|
| 4:23:34| I'm not going to send it back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15814)|
| 4:23:36| but we said go and talk to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15816)|
| 4:23:42| Last time they were here, we said go and talk to the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15822)|
| 4:23:48| get a recommendation of what we needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15828)|
| 4:23:52| I'm asking, as the district commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15832)|
| 4:23:53| if you would be willing to amend your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15833)|
| 4:23:55| to include the traffic signal at Roberts Road and Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15835)|
| 4:23:58| as a justification for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15838)|
| 4:24:00| I will amend the motion to add the traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15840)|
| 4:24:05| That's why we're changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15845)|
| 4:24:07| Is that OK with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15847)|
| 4:24:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15849)|
| 4:24:11| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15851)|
| 4:24:14| We can vote, but it says here, additional roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15854)|
| 4:24:18| would not warrant amending the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15858)|
| 4:24:21| use for general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15861)|
| 4:24:24| Is that from the Planning Commission's report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15864)|
| 4:24:27| Right here, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15867)|
| 4:24:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15868)|
| 4:24:29| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15869)|
| 4:24:30| I know we recommended that they go back and talk to Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15870)|
| 4:24:33| but the first time they came here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15873)|
| 4:24:36| my suggestion to them was neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15876)|
| 4:24:39| with a barrier, not what they're bringing forth now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15879)|
| 4:24:45| What they're bringing forth now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| is not what the original thought process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15887)|
| 4:24:50| So I know we told them, hey, go back to Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15890)|
| 4:24:53| and talk to Planning, but that was with the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15893)|
| 4:24:56| that we should never assume, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15896)|
| 4:24:58| that there was going to be neighborhood commercial coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15898)|
| 4:25:01| back to us, not GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15901)|
| 4:25:03| GC is a whole different animal than neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15903)|
| 4:25:06| You're talking about two very different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15906)|
| 4:25:11| in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15911)|
| 4:25:13| Again, my personal opinion is it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15913)|
| 4:25:17| a very slippery slope that you're asking for here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15917)|
| 4:25:20| basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15920)|
| 4:25:22| We have a motion before us by Commissioner Buster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15922)|
| 4:25:24| with a second by Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15924)|
| 4:25:26| to approve the appeal of the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15926)|
| 4:25:30| denial on the basis of a new traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15930)|
| 4:25:34| at Roberts Road and Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15934)|
| 4:25:37| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15937)|
| 4:25:38| Just one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15938)|
| 4:25:40| Do I recall in past conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15940)|
| 4:25:44| the statement that that whole area is, in fact, commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15944)|
| 4:25:50| There are a number of commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15950)|
| 4:25:52| in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15952)|
| 4:25:53| This was kind of a piece that just-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15953)|
| 4:25:55| Their grandfathered piece, very early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15955)|
| 4:25:57| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15957)|
| 4:25:58| Grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15958)|
| 4:25:59| And there's residential behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15959)|
| 4:26:01| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15961)|
| 4:26:02| There's residential behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15962)|
| 4:26:05| Right, but not on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15965)|
| 4:26:06| No, no, not on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15966)|
| 4:26:07| But the philosophy that I'm taking is that, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15967)|
| 4:26:13| neighborhood commercial is put there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15973)|
| 4:26:14| because there's a neighborhood literally behind it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15974)|
| 4:26:17| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15977)|
| 4:26:18| So once you go to GC, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15978)|
| 4:26:21| you could put a garbage company there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15981)|
| 4:26:24| So would you rather have neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15984)|
| 4:26:26| with restaurants, maybe a gas station at worst?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15986)|
| 4:26:29| Or do you want something more industrialized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15989)|
| 4:26:32| being right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15992)|
| 4:26:34| This is such an older, developed area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15994)|
| 4:26:39| that everything was, I mean, grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=15999)|
| 4:26:43| It's unlikely the existing uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16003)|
| 4:26:47| are probably going to vary much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16007)|
| 4:26:51| May I say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16011)|
| 4:26:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16012)|
| 4:26:53| Will you please consider the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16013)|
| 4:26:54| that it's only a little bit above an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16014)|
| 4:26:56| so you're not going to do a whole lot of heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16016)|
| 4:26:59| We're just, as a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16019)|
| 4:27:00| we're thinking about building some kind of a shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16020)|
| 4:27:03| maybe for the boys to sell cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16023)|
| 4:27:05| maybe for the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16025)|
| 4:27:07| We are very clean people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16027)|
| 4:27:08| And I understand I'm in real estate as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16028)|
| 4:27:10| so I know that we might turn around and sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16030)|
| 4:27:12| but it's only a little over an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16032)|
| 4:27:15| It's surrounded by mature trees on all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16035)|
| 4:27:18| It's fenced in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16038)|
| 4:27:19| There's two entrances from this highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16039)|
| 4:27:22| and from Roberts Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16042)|
| 4:27:24| My main yard's a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16044)|
| 4:27:26| I have 14 trucks just in that one yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16046)|
| 4:27:29| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16049)|
| 4:27:30| It's completely fenced in, barbed wire, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16050)|
| 4:27:33| It's very clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16053)|
| 4:27:34| but it doesn't matter how big or small it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16054)|
| 4:27:36| It's what you're actually using it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16056)|
| 4:27:38| There was no neighbors to say no to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16058)|
| 4:27:42| We have a proper motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16062)|
| 4:27:44| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16064)|
| 4:27:45| Can we restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16065)|
| 4:27:47| We certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16067)|
| 4:27:48| The motion by Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16068)|
| 4:27:50| with a second by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16070)|
| 4:27:51| is to approve the appeal of the sector plan amendment denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16071)|
| 4:27:57| And that is on the basis of a traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16077)|
| 4:27:59| being installed at Roberts Road and Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16079)|
| 4:28:03| So a yes vote is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16083)|
| 4:28:04| A yes vote is to approve the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| and amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16088)|
| 4:28:12| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16092)|

| 4:28:28| It's to approve their appeal of the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16108)|
| 4:28:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16112)|
| 4:28:34| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16114)|

| 4:29:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16158)|

| 4:29:21| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16161)|
| 4:29:28| The vote is four ayes and seven noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16168)|
| 4:29:32| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16172)|
| 4:29:36| Madam Clerk, we need an affirmative motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16176)|
| 4:29:45| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16185)|
| 4:29:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16186)|
| 4:29:47| I was going to see if this body would entertain a motion to send this back to MPC to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16187)|
| 4:29:54| a sector plan change for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16194)|
| 4:29:58| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16198)|
| 4:29:59| Since it's an appeal, it's not a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16199)|
| 4:30:04| I just want to make sure because of situations we've encountered in the past where those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16204)|
| 4:30:10| are on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16210)|
| 4:30:11| It's on an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16211)|
| 4:30:12| If it fails, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16212)|
| 4:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16213)|
| 4:30:14| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16214)|
| 4:30:19| We can read it, but it would be a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16219)|
| 4:30:22| Did you want to make a motion, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16222)|
| 4:30:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16225)|
| 4:30:26| I'd like to make a motion that we send this piece of property back to MPC to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16226)|
| 4:30:32| a general commercial zoning sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16232)|
| 4:30:37| Motion by Commissioner Smith to consider a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16237)|
| 4:30:41| And second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16241)|
| 4:30:44| Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16244)|
| 4:30:45| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16245)|
| 4:30:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16246)|
| 4:30:47| It goes back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16247)|
| 4:30:50| And it comes back just like it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16250)|
| 4:30:53| Fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16253)|
| 4:30:54| Then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16254)|
| 4:30:59| The consensus from some seems to be that we could then change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16259)|
| 4:31:06| I don't have a lot, but I do have some things to say as the District Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16266)|
| 4:31:11| But you still have the floor, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16271)|
| 4:31:14| If that's what we're going to do, we're going to sit it over there and we're going to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16274)|
| 4:31:18| at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16278)|
| 4:31:19| And when will it come back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16279)|
| 4:31:25| No, it would have to go in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16285)|
| 4:31:28| You'd be here again in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16288)|
| 4:31:35| I don't understand why we can't do it now, but we can do it later, even though they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16295)|
| 4:31:42| already denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16302)|
| 4:31:43| It just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16303)|
| 4:31:45| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16305)|
| 4:31:46| If I may, I don't have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16306)|
| 4:31:49| So, you know, my dilemma with this is the same as Commissioner Ward's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16309)|
| 4:31:55| I understand the maddening nature of the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16315)|
| 4:31:59| And I understand that there's both sides to this, because Rutledge Pike has for many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16319)|
| 4:32:03| many years, even back when it was two lane, it's been a commercial industrial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16323)|
| 4:32:08| of sorts with mixed residential as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16328)|
| 4:32:12| But there is a reason why this sector plan overlay was what it was when it was put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16332)|
| 4:32:18| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16338)|
| 4:32:19| Because there is a desire to have neighborhood commercial properties, especially at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16339)|
| 4:32:25| intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16345)|
| 4:32:27| And in my view, a signal going in at that intersection actually strengthens the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16347)|
| 4:32:32| for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16352)|
| 4:32:34| There's a Dollar General across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16354)|
| 4:32:36| There's about to be a convenience store across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16356)|
| 4:32:38| There's a house on the other corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16358)|
| 4:32:40| And it would make sense for there to be some sort of retail or neighborhood friendly development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16360)|
| 4:32:46| on this particular corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16366)|
| 4:32:49| So, while I appreciate the procedural nature of the motion, I do not support a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16369)|
| 4:32:55| amendment on this property at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16375)|
| 4:33:04| Mr. Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16384)|
| 4:33:05| Your light was still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16385)|
| 4:33:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16386)|
| 4:33:10| Sometimes when you get those developments that are neighborhood commercial, you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16390)|
| 4:33:15| a saturation and you need no more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16395)|
| 4:33:18| If you'll remember back on the rezoning for Dutchtown, that was a piece of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16398)|
| 4:33:24| commercial property that they turned into residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16404)|
| 4:33:30| And the MPC supported that because development patterns had no longer made it supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16410)|
| 4:33:38| for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16418)|
| 4:33:41| So, I mean, how many Dollar Generals and convenience stores can you put in an intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16421)|
| 4:33:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16427)|
| 4:33:52| You put four, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16432)|
| 4:33:53| Fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16433)|
| 4:33:55| Fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16435)|
| 4:33:56| But there is not a lot of neighborhood commercial on Routledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16436)|
| 4:33:59| I mean, the argument to that is it's a down zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16439)|
| 4:34:01| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16441)|
| 4:34:02| The argument to that is it's a down zone, not an up zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16442)|
| 4:34:04| This is an up zone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16444)|
| 4:34:06| But I understand your point at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16446)|
| 4:34:08| But I think the area is not, you know, East Knoxville is not really fully developed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16448)|
| 4:34:13| We're going that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16453)|
| 4:34:14| If we're going to have, I mean, let's all be very honest with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16454)|
| 4:34:17| We have a housing shortage and we need to do higher density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16457)|
| 4:34:22| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16462)|
| 4:34:23| Hardin Valley is getting filled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16463)|
| 4:34:24| East Knoxville and South Knoxville are most likely next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16464)|
| 4:34:28| The main highway goes through East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16468)|
| 4:34:30| That's where the next leg of development is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16470)|
| 4:34:33| It's really easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16473)|
| 4:34:34| When you go to look where the next section is, take a satellite view and look where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16474)|
| 4:34:38| green is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16478)|
| 4:34:39| That's where you're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16479)|
| 4:34:40| It's all the greens in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16480)|
| 4:34:43| So if we're going to have people, you know, 10,000 a year moving that direction possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16483)|
| 4:34:50| it could be that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16490)|
| 4:34:53| And we've already decided as a community this is what we're going to kind of lay forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16493)|
| 4:34:57| is this neighborhood commercial so we can attract more neighborhoods to that area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16497)|
| 4:35:00| support more neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16500)|
| 4:35:03| I still have the, I am with Commissioner Buehler, like, I'm fine with building this up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16503)|
| 4:35:08| tonight and just getting past this so we're not kicking the can down the road three more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16508)|
| 4:35:13| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16513)|
| 4:35:14| I understand there's a procedure and there's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16514)|
| 4:35:16| I've only been here for a year so I don't know it as well as, you know, my more senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16516)|
| 4:35:20| members do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16520)|
| 4:35:21| But I still hold the same argument that there's right and wrong in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16521)|
| 4:35:31| We have a motion before us to send this to the Planning Commission for a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16531)|
| 4:35:36| to consider a sector plan amendment to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16536)|
| 4:35:39| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16539)|
| 4:35:42| I think we should also maybe ask the applicant if they want to proceed with going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16542)|
| 4:35:47| They may not want to be put through the wringer for another couple of turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16547)|
| 4:35:52| We're thinking about what to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16552)|
| 4:35:54| CA allows for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16554)|
| 4:35:56| We actually had that thought too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16556)|
| 4:35:58| So right now we're not, we wanted the flexibility of CA for many, multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16558)|
| 4:36:03| Which one is townhomes that you can't build on the neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16563)|
| 4:36:08| We'll get quite a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16568)|
| 4:36:11| That's kind of my point from previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16571)|
| 4:36:16| If I had a property now, I would ask for the same exact thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16576)|
| 4:36:21| Because my property that's zoned whatever, I can now upzone it and build multi-unit family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16581)|
| 4:36:29| townhome complex on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16589)|
| 4:36:32| So it's not fair that you guys get to do that, even though the sector plan says you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16592)|
| 4:36:37| Where my sector plan says I can't, I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16597)|
| 4:36:41| They won't let me do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16601)|
| 4:36:42| Well, I thought housing was what you're worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16602)|
| 4:36:44| No, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16604)|
| 4:36:45| I 100% agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16605)|
| 4:36:46| There's the option for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16606)|
| 4:36:48| We don't mind going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16608)|
| 4:36:49| We don't mind seeing your beautiful faces again if we can get somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16609)|
| 4:36:56| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16616)|
| 4:36:58| Believe me, if it was up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16618)|
| 4:37:01| My mindset is it's your property, you do what you want with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16621)|
| 4:37:04| But there's rules for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16624)|
| 4:37:06| Because otherwise we just have townhome complexes everywhere because they make more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16626)|
| 4:37:11| So it still comes down to what's fair and what's right to wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16631)|
| 4:37:15| Why do you get to be a special case versus anybody up here for their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16635)|
| 4:37:19| Because somebody down the road did the same thing from neighborhood commercial to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16639)|
| 4:37:25| To industrial within 300 feet from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16645)|
| 4:37:30| That was in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16650)|
| 4:37:31| That's not that long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16651)|
| 4:37:33| Nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16653)|
| 4:37:34| So why is it now things have changed so drastically and not allowing us to do what we wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16654)|
| 4:37:40| Because the community decided there's a sector plan for what direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16660)|
| 4:37:44| Well, basically in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16664)|
| 4:37:46| You decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16666)|
| 4:37:47| You decide for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16667)|
| 4:37:49| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16669)|
| 4:37:51| Director Brooks, I'm going to learn something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16671)|
| 4:37:54| I didn't know the residential could be in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16674)|
| 4:37:58| In a CA zone, uses permitted include houses and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16678)|
| 4:38:06| On one acre, that's all they got is one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16686)|
| 4:38:10| See, that's another thing that we've got to always consider is the zoning goes with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16690)|
| 4:38:15| We've got contractor's yard to a car dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16695)|
| 4:38:19| Now we're at the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16699)|
| 4:38:21| We've got to keep all that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16701)|
| 4:38:25| What is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16705)|
| 4:38:26| The motion is to send this back to the Planning Commission to consider a sector plan amendment to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16706)|
| 4:38:37| So that's 55 and 54 or just 55?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16717)|
| 4:38:40| That's 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16720)|
| 4:38:41| Well, it would be related to 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16721)|
| 4:38:45| That's a motion by Commissioner Smith and a second by Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16725)|
| 4:38:48| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16728)|
| 4:38:50| It's your district, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16730)|
| 4:38:52| I'd be in favor if you want to make a substitute motion to do it up and down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16732)|
| 4:38:56| I'd be in favor of supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16736)|
| 4:38:58| But it's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16738)|
| 4:39:00| I don't want to step on your toes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16740)|
| 4:39:02| And I'm the junior member here, so my two senior members are telling me this is what procedural has happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16742)|
| 4:39:08| So I'd definitely support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16748)|
| 4:39:10| We've already voted it down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16750)|
| 4:39:12| So the question is do we want to send it back now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16752)|
| 4:39:15| No, the winning side can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16755)|
| 4:39:17| Someone from the winning side can ask for it to be heard again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16757)|
| 4:39:20| By a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16760)|
| 4:39:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16762)|
| 4:39:24| Two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16764)|
| 4:39:26| It would take eight members to bring it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16766)|
| 4:39:28| To bring the appeal back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16768)|
| 4:39:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16770)|
| 4:39:31| We can bring it back up tonight if the winning side makes a motion to hear it and there's eight votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16771)|
| 4:39:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16777)|
| 4:39:38| But Commissioner Smith's motion is still proper, I would assume, to send this back to the Planning Commission, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16778)|
| 4:39:45| We've already voted it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16785)|
| 4:39:46| How are you going to send it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16786)|
| 4:39:48| He's talking about initiating a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16788)|
| 4:39:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16790)|
| 4:39:51| Commission can initiate a sector plan change simply by us voting to request them to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16791)|
| 4:39:58| True, Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16798)|
| 4:40:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16800)|
| 4:40:02| Not on behalf of the applicant, but simply on behalf of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16802)|
| 4:40:06| On behalf of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16806)|
| 4:40:11| So we voted down the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16811)|
| 4:40:14| But the motion is for the County Commission to initiate a sector plan amendment on this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16814)|
| 4:40:20| My thought is some of my fellow Cogleys might not have been comfortable with the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16820)|
| 4:40:26| that we weren't following our own rules on how we've handled these things in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16826)|
| 4:40:31| And they might support changing the sector plan if it were done in a way that we've always done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16831)|
| 4:40:44| The motion is on the floor by Commissioner Smith and the second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16844)|
| 4:40:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16848)|
| 4:40:50| Okay, so the Knox County Commission is going to mandate to the Knox Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16850)|
| 4:40:57| that on this 1.3 acre parcel that we want to have a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16857)|
| 4:41:03| Is that what we're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16863)|
| 4:41:05| And so the applicant is out of the question at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16865)|
| 4:41:08| because it's the Knox County Commission that's going to require the MPC to put it on their agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16868)|
| 4:41:15| and rule on it that we want to make a sector plan change just for this one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16875)|
| 4:41:29| Because we've already voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16889)|
| 4:41:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16892)|
| 4:41:34| Does everyone understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16894)|
| 4:41:38| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16898)|
| 4:41:40| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16900)|
| 4:41:43| Madam Clerk, please do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16903)|
| 4:41:48| Before you do the roll call vote, just please restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16908)|
| 4:41:51| I want to make sure everybody's clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16911)|
| 4:41:53| The motion is for the Commission to send a request to Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16913)|
| 4:42:01| for a sector plan amendment on parcel number 42-029 from NC to GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16921)|
| 4:42:14| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=16934)|

| 4:43:51| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=17031)|
| 4:43:54| If we decide to go neighborhood commercial, do we have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=17034)|
| 4:43:56| back here again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-211025?start=17036)|
