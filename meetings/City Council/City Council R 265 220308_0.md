| 0:02:36| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I just want to first kick things off by saying thank you to Vice Mayor Roberto and all of City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| for holding such a thorough workshop on the city's compensation study last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| I thought the presentation by the consultants, the management advisory group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| and the questions that followed were really well thought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| and helped flesh out the importance of this study and the city's next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| The compensation study showed that city salaries are, on average, 10% behind the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| That large pay gap is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| It's demoralizing to our employees and a weak link in the city's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| to provide the essential services that residents and businesses expect and are asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| As you know, I will be implementing MAG's recommendations into my budget proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| which will be unveiled in late April, and you all will vote on it in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| So, again, thank you for your continued attention to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| and I look forward to discussing our path forward in the weeks to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| I also want to recognize six council members today on this International Women's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| Council Member Parker, or maybe I should say Councilwoman, since that's why I'm celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| Councilwoman Parker, Councilwoman Singh, Councilwoman McKenzie, Councilwoman Fugett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Councilwoman Ryder, and Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| Today is the International Day of Women, and I'm really grateful for your leadership of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| Women are amazing leaders, and you guys are great examples of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| and thank you for being such impactful leaders in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| So it's my honor to work with you, and I know the men among us agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| Right, men?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Happy International Women's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| And we did have the Man Festival or something last weekend, so we don't forget our men, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| But it is International Women's Day, and I'm glad to have such great women leaders on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| and in our city leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| In other news, I'm happy to announce that CAT will return several bus routes to regular service levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| on Monday, March 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| I want to thank Isaac Thorne, Director of Transit, for working so hard to make this possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| all while still experiencing a driver shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| I know you have seen your share of challenges with staffing, but this is a huge step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| All remaining routes experiencing reduced service should hopefully be back to regular service within the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| In addition, CAT is also rolling out the first all-electric bus along the Sutherland route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| This is a huge step toward reaching our environmental goals in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| and I think riders will find the all-electric buses are quieter and quite smooth rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| So to learn more about the route changes, check out the city's or CAT's Facebook pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| or go online to the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=312)|

| 0:05:51| and hopefully we'll hear your input as we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=351)|

| 0:05:58| So pleased to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| The students have voted to have at least two members present at each meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| and I think that it's great that they're making that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| So last but not least, the rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=370)|

| 0:06:21| please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| Those who fail to adhere to these rules may be ruled out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=386)|

| 0:06:37| And that is it for my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Next is reports of council members or committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=400)|

| 0:06:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Council colleagues, I just want to give you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| As we know, we have a tough situation going on in the world right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| with Russia invading Ukraine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| At our pension investment committee last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| we met when we were meeting with the investment advisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| discovered we asked what percent of the pension fund portfolio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| might be invested in anything in Russia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| It is 1% or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| and we have given direction to get us out of that as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| What I do want people to understand is there has to be a market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| for someone to buy them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| and we are not alone in asking for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| I know we're going to get asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| It's reasonable to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=456)|

| 0:08:45| Yeah, I just wanted to add to the transportation news earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| It's been announced in February the KTA board met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| and the mayor has already announced as well CAT reimagined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| which is a comprehensive analysis of the transportation network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| ridership gaps, and opportunities in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| And the first publicly accessible meetings to get community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| will be in April for that working kind of body of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| There's three phases, CAT, and then other agencies that support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| network, and then a regional study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=559)|

| 0:09:24| and the community will have multiple input sessions throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=564)|

| 0:10:25| I'm George Bove, 905 Cloverfield Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| What a pleasure it is, Mayor, to speak in front of you and Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| and Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| I appreciate the opportunity for us to talk just a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| Roy Cruz, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Jim Wright, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| standing here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Jim has been a really good, good, good, good, good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Maybe I'll add another good in there, of Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| And I didn't know his name was Royston, though, so we probably won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| go there with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| But our friend Roy, I think all of you all know Roy, but if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| if I could just entertain you for a second, I would imagine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| everybody who had ever met Roy, if we were to stand here and tell a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| story, just one story on Roy, by the time we finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| we'd all be with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| That's how many stories that we have on Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| But it's my pleasure to just say a few things about how absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| priceless Roy Cruz was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Roy had left California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| If you all knew it, he was a Californian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| He was a union teamster out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| He was a teamster leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| And when he retired at the springing age of 55, I called Roy last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| to give him a hard time about that because I retired at 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| And he said, ah, you didn't even come close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| I retired years ago at 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| So Roy retired at 55, and he thought, well, he's going to move to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| lakes of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| And he took Alice and his family, and they moved up to Norris Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And they had a beautiful house sitting right there on the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| And Roy sat in that house, Jim, I think for two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| And he said he can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| This is not the life for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| So they loaded up the truck, and they moved to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And we know that same Roy because he became a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| Those things are priceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Roy was appointed and served Mayor Burchett and Mayor Jacobs as a union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| labor liaison, so both of them could understand the union issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| were going on, and served the union folks very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| Roy had never once in his life asked who was a Democrat or who was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| It didn't matter to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| He only focused on the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| And if you know Roy, you know that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| And that one thing right there is absolutely priceless, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| Roy's community ask, he would come around and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| I'm sure you all are very aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| I'm sure that your wallet, if anything, right, Jim, is very aware that Roy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| would ask, was never one time for Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| It was always for somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| Every single time he asked, he was asking for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| Man, that is priceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| Whatever memory you may have or whatever you feel, an event that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| with Roy Cruz, I want you to know that that is what's known as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| sentimental value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Sentimental value is the thing that you have, that we have, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| Knoxville should have about this man that nobody with all the money in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| world could buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| It's priceless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| No army can take that from you, no matter how big that army is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| That value, that sentimental value, that's the real stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=817)|
| 0:13:46| Roy Cruz was a mentor, especially for the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| Well, he taught us what to do with our retirement years, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| You've seen him use his retirement years, every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| He was a leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| He was kind, sincere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| More than anything, Roy Cruz was a Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| When he left here, he left here representing Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| I want to thank you, Mayor Kincannon, Vice Mayor Roberto and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=853)|

| 0:14:53| I want to recognize that on behalf of the Knoxville Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| and Building Trades Council, Chris O'Keefe with the Ironworkers Local 384| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| is here in honor of Roy Cruz as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Roy was a good friend and the embodiment of being a servant leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| You couldn't go to a public meeting like George was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| without running into Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| He was involved in everything, and he will be deeply missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| I just want to reiterate that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| We all do probably have a story, and I've known him for well over a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| and I just want to say what a treasure he was to this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| what a legacy he has left in the foundation of so many great causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| that he was involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| He did have a heart of gold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| and just was always there to put a smile on your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| So I think this is thank you for bringing this forth and most deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| I appreciate the eloquent words of Mr. Bove and my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| Roy was a very remarkable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| He was a good friend of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| and I offer condolences to his family and all of his friends as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| He will be remembered in the best possible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| I just want to echo all the remarks that have been stated about Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| Roy was an outstanding person, always had a smile on his face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| family friend of ours, the McKenzie family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| and I remember seeing Roy at the Motley Crue lunches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| and we always talked about we were going to jump in the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| and ride to a ball game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| and I hate that we didn't get that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| but my prayers go out to his family and all his friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| He touched so many people's lives in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Okay, yeah, I will certainly share all these sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I've known Roy for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| and certainly a great role model for us to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Your opportunities to serve do not end when you retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| In fact, they can be the beginning of a whole new second career of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| which he certainly did in his adopted home of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| so we're very grateful to remember him with gratitude this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1029)|

| 0:17:50| located at 210 East Jackson Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1070)|

| 0:17:59| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| This really bothers me because of when we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| there's a sentence in the contract, and I meant to talk to RJ about it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| but we didn't get back in touch with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| What is on my mind is when we were working on the stadium contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| and talking about how much a minimum wage would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| and we did not approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| I'm really glad that the city went up to $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| One of the things in the contract that really got my attention was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| without the requested public assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| the project can be expected to produce financial returns that are lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| than the standard targets of real property developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| So the pilot that we're doing is to fill in the gap for their profit margin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| and this is in millions we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| When we were talking about $15.50, we couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| But when it's on the upper end, we seem okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| I'm not against this, but that is what stands out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| What is the profit margin without the pilots, and what is it with the pilots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Thanks so much, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| First of all, I just want to make sure that everyone understands that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| These projects all have to get financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| This is a $21-$22 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| The developer will actually have to borrow money to be able to make this project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| In order to be able to get financing for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| there's a certain level of return that the financing institution requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| just in order to be able to get the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| So anything that's lower than that level of return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| and our developer community sometimes disagrees with us about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| because they feel we set it pretty low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| but we're saying a target of around 12% is probably going to be able to allow you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| to go get the financing that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| So I think that's important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| So when we say a profit lower than the expected rate of return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| that means if they don't get that rate of return, there's no financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| there's no project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| So that becomes the city's issue only if that project is going to benefit the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1221)|
| 0:20:30| That becomes the city's issue when we see that there's a public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| to redeveloping an empty parking lot into, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| a redeveloped piece of property that, A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| generates new revenue for the entire city through other mechanisms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| sales tax, through tourism, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| and that creates additional foot traffic in the area and that brings an amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| to our city that's attractive to visitors, employers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| So there's a parking lot there right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| which could be useful for parking with the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| We're going to have some parking issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Ms. Singh, if you could speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Speaking right to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| What I was saying is it's a parking lot right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| which we're going to need parking for the stadium when it's completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| and that's going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I mean, I see benefits to a motel and something there versus a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| but is it enough of a benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| I know in reading through this, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| I know the developers don't think the 12% is quite a good standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| but in reading through this, there was also the piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| if they end up renting out the rooms for a higher rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| then it will exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| There's a cost and revenue model that obviously changes depending on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| variety of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| So there is a lot of estimating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| and we're basing these recommendations on assumptions that we have experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| weighing in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| I know there were discussions about a 15-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| and there was a lot of struggle in getting it to a 10-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| and I respect that you really worked on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| And like I said, I'm not against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| but I do think we need to keep it in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| I don't think we can do business the way that we always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Knoxville has 30% poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| and this trickle-down theory just doesn't seem to work for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| I know that there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| everyone talks about how great Knoxville is doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| There's a really good economic situation going on for some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| and I don't know if this helps the people that really need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| And once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| my focus is we couldn't pay people $15.50 to make even close to a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| That's not a living wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| but we're okay with trying to make sure that enough of a profit margin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| is done so they feel good about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| doing the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| These are my opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Council Member Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| and then Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| and then more as we get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I just want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I'm really pleased to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| The financial analysis shows that when this project is completed and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| goes back on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| we will generate over a quarter million dollars more in tax revenue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| will go to the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| which is what we need to provide a lot of services that we try to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| for folks who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| I agree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Ms. Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| there are people who are not reaping the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Tax revenue is how we help fund some projects to help do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| And so I fully support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| I will also say thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Deputy Mayor Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| for your explanation of the financing piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| I think we throw the word profit around and what is too much profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| I talked about it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Developers borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| They put their entire financial livelihood on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| No bank is going to loan them $21 million unless the project is profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| And if we want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| and some of us may disagree about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| but that's why I fully support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Yeah, I definitely echo this as far as expanding our tax base is exactly what this project does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| I do have a question regarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| and I know it's alluded to in here about the empty lot across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| I mean, obviously that's prime real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| And so being a surface lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| there seems to be some plan to develop that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| Obviously this has to go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| but is there any kind of timeline that they're talking about for further development of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| The developer for that lot is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| I don't know if Mr. Hill has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| He's been in communication with the developer recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Our conversations at this point are just their future plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| There's a lot of uncertainty in the construction market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| There's a lot of uncertainty sort of generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| So when that happens, we're not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| But we know for sure that he has on his timeline in the future to do something with that lot across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I agree with some of the sentiments that we should have equity as it relates to this third party review and that it should be objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1550)|
| 0:26:00| And I think as a body, at least my perspective is we have a third party reviewer that reviews all these equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| At least the same person is reviewing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| There are certain guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| So it would be hard for me to pick and choose certain situations where it doesn't make sense to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| With that said, I think there's a beneficial conversation to add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| that it's not necessarily that we need to take a carrot to the high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| Excuse me, take a stick to the high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| I think it's more we should make the lower end possible for people who are developing properties that aren't $21 million in investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| So along those lines, I'd like to ask Deputy Mayor, is there a minimum investment required for a developer to apply for the pilot process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1597)|
| 0:26:49| There's no minimum that we've set by policy or even by practice at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| We recently brought a smaller project to you, Shanklin Flats, if I remember, in a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1614)|
| 0:27:03| Fourth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Fourth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| So we certainly are looking at that model and how we can make sure to accommodate smaller size development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| keeping in mind that with smaller amounts of money there is less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| So we have to take that into account as one of the many assumptions that are being analyzed through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| But, yeah, that's a great question, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| So I think of buildings in South Knoxville particularly that redeveloping them is going to be $4 million, not $20-something million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| Those smaller developers or individuals can apply for this pilot process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| even though there is less risk given the total dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| maybe not to that individual and to their livelihood or what they're putting at stake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| but on the whole that's a possibility for smaller developers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| And what I would recommend, Councilman, and to anyone on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| if there are properties in your district and you know of developers who are interested in finding ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| creative ways to help make those projects move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| please send them our way because it may not be a pilot or a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| but there may be some other type of process that we can help them with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| So we certainly want to encourage investment of all sizes, and we're here and ready to assist with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| And I want to thank you for making that offer to me because I've brought a few folks to you and will continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| So I think it's important to think about the whole spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Development of all shapes and sizes should have an equitable shot at incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| whether it's facade grants, pilots, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| I do think there is something to be addressed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| There is a fee associated with the pilot process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| What is that fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| There's a fee schedule, and so the actual third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| there's a pretty hefty fee with that to go through the financial review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| And so I can tell you that fee is about $10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| and there are other fees associated with applying for the pilot and lawyer fees, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| So there's a fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I think Mr. Bentley is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I don't have that right in front of me, so if you wanted the details on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| I'm sure he would be willing to speak to that as the support agency for the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| But, yes, there are fees, which is the other piece of this to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| that these projects require some resource to be able to get off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Mr. Bentley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| So we just actually revised the fee schedule for the IDB with this exact issue in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| So I think the low end of this is $10,000 for the third-party review is sort of a flat fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| That's charged by the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| But in terms of what the IDB charges folks, we've lowered that down to $5,000 at the low end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| understanding that Shanklin Flats is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| That was a $2 million capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| So some of the types of projects that you're thinking about, that's exactly what I know the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| and, by extension, the IDB is trying to encourage more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| And if we get to a point where the fees are too high for deals like that, we can always revisit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| That's, I think, a really important thing to remember and a really important change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| I think for a future conversation is the fees associated with the third-party reviewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| to the extent we can scale those or make those more equitable for smaller projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| I think that's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you, Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Councilmember McKenzie and then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| So I just want to say that I definitely understand the concern that Councilwoman Singh brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| I support this project primarily because this is a 127-room hotel that's going to generate jobs in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1845)|
| 0:30:54| which are sorely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| I do know personally that there are hotels that we've had here for many years that people have worked at proudly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| for many years to be able to provide for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| And so I'm in favor of supporting this due to the fact that there will be job opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| and hope that they will be jobs that will pay a fair market wage, hopefully $15 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| although we cannot dictate that as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| But I want to be very clear that I welcome the opportunity to have more jobs that are available closer to the inner city here in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1880)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you, Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Yeah, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| Ms. Welch, so there's been a lot of talk here about the tax revenue for the property tax, which is what the pilot is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1898)|
| 0:31:47| But there are other tax revenues that will be generated by a hotel project, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| And are there calculated numbers that have already been estimated for the 127 rooms for a project like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1914)|
| 0:32:03| That calculation was not included as part of this analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| But in a general sense, I don't know if Mr. Evans could comment on, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| how much hotel-motel heads-in-bed benefits we get out of a project like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| Your microphone is muted, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| It's maybe your arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Get rid of the arms to your chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| There, now it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| You're going to get hotel-motel tax, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| We're going to get state-shared sales tax, and we're going to get local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| I mean, all of that would come out of something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Are you asking, ma'am, the precise figures on how much we get for a head-in-a-bed, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Don't we have numbers like that from Visit Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| We can get that back to you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| The person that's the expert on this is Ms. Kitchin-Smith right behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| She can look that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| I'll ask my other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| We'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| You can come back to that because I feel like we've got some estimated numbers we've used before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| I know it's not part of estimating the pilot package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| but I think the conversation needs to focus on there are other tax revenues that come as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| Those are the three tax revenues that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Whereas if it were residential, it would not have those kind of revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| or if it were retail, it would have local option sales tax, but it wouldn't have a hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2016)|
| 0:33:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| If it was residential, you'd get property tax out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| That would be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Not if there's a pilot on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| You wouldn't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Well, also in 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Yes, after the pilot expires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| but I'm just trying to highlight the fact that there's other revenue streams that come with this outside of the pilot tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I heard a comment about the room rate being a factor in the financial pilot assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2049)|
| 0:34:19| Yes, counsel and Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| So when the third-party reviewer reviews the finances, you're looking at revenue and you're looking at expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| and so part of the revenue is obviously the room rental rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| But the room rate is set by the brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| It's not an arbitrary figure that the developer can, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| they're not going to go into a project with this without the flag being established for the brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| So there's quite a science behind setting hotel room rates, as I have learned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| and it's based on obviously the brand and the type of product that the hotel is offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| It's based on the market and the area where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| So there are a variety of factors, but there are some pretty well-defined assumptions that go into setting those room rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2103)|
| 0:35:13| Of course, keep in mind we're in the middle of COVID and we have other things going on that sort of influence that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| but it's not just a number they're pulling out of the air for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Right, and they can't just move it around at will to achieve a number to be able to bridge the gap to get a bank loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Okay, because that's what the pilot is about, is bridging the gap to be able to get a bank loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| because the other alternative is you come up with more capital to be able to make the, you come to the table with more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| And if you can't bring enough money to the table, then you can't make the project happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| I would like to call on Mr. Hill because I spoke to him about the parking because I think I want it to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| One of the concerns we hear out of people with many of the projects that are coming up in like the baseball stadium in that area is parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2159)|
| 0:36:08| So this project comes with secured owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| The owner of the project has parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| That is Tim Hill, Tim Hill, 311 South Wise Garber Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, and that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| He owns the property where he will provide the 100 spaces and most likely if he develops that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2183)|
| 0:36:32| he will make provisions to keep an adequate level of parking for this hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2192)|
| 0:36:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| I appreciate that because that was one of my concerns was 157, 147 beds and no parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| But he owns it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| It's not a negotiated agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| It is his parking and it's part of this package that he's providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| And I would like to add when you talk about bringing more capital to a project, you know, to bridge the gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| at that point then there's no incentive for the developer to do the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| You drive down, you take out all the profit in the deal, and these internal rates of return that you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2227)|
| 0:37:15| the developer often has to wait, in his case, 17 years to get his average 11%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| This isn't an 11% return year over year out of the gate or even when it's stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| And there's a lot, I've seen a lot of confusion with this body, and it's easy to be confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| especially if you're not in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| So for this guy to benefit, he has to kill the asset by selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| A lot of people are buy and hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| They don't want to sell their assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| But in this case, for him to get the 11%, he has to wait 17 years and then sell the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| So he's not, to be clear for everybody, he's not getting an 11% return every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| This isn't a compounding interest situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| It's a speculative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| You're not getting it at the end of the year every Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| And you're speculating on the price 17 years into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| Of what the economy will be doing at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| And whether the market will be suppressed or higher or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| It's all a bank speculation to make the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| There's no money in the pocket until the asset is sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| The 11% will be applied backward as a result of the terminal value of the sale of the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| And Nick Patel sends his regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| And I had to stand in at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Mr. Hill, do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| I have one more question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| So, 11%, there won't be ongoing income over the 10 years during the time the pilot is in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2328)|
| 0:39:02| There will be some income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| It's very nominal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| If you look at cash on cash, he gets no return in the first four years, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| And then he starts getting nominal returns, you know, 3.9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| It starts ticking up, 4%, 5%, 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| But when you've got $5.5 million of your money, of your equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| and it's yielding zero for the first three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| and then 3% or 4% in the ensuing years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| that's not motivation to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| So, help me with this math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| We talk such big numbers that 3% or 4% over the next few years of a $21 million investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2381)|
| 0:39:51| so the nominal growth he'll have or profit margin he'll have is about how much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| At 4%, $21 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| How much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Each year, are we talking about each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| I can give you a cash flow that's on the back page of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| And if you look in year four, his cash on cash return is 3.9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| So, that's $211,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| I just wanted to put some numbers behind it rather than just percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| But remember, he's tied up $5.5 million, and he's on the hook for the remaining loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| That's his choice he's making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| Yes, it is his choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| You know, we're so concerned about this isn't a risk if you don't lose anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| This isn't mom and pop making an investment that if it doesn't go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| they're going to lose the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| This isn't at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| This is at a much different level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| I would respectfully disagree because your house is on the line with personal guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| One more question for Mr. Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Can you remind me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| You said that there were three other revenue streams from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| You're going to have at least three that I can think of and eventually a fourth one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| You are going to have the hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| You're going to have the, you know, for anything that they sell in this place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| you're going to have state shared sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| You're going to have local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| And then eventually once the property comes back full on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| you're going to have the property tax values as well, which is one I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| I mean, I hadn't seen the numbers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| It should be higher than anything it's paying now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| So the hotel motel property taxes, how is that divided up between the city and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Does it come to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| How much of that comes to the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Mr. Evans, can you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| A part of it, we have city hotel motel tax that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| and then there's county hotel motel tax, and I think we get a cut of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| But, again, I think Kitrin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| We can also get you a full breakdown of that if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I mean, we get the state shared sales tax comes in through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Obviously property taxes come in directly to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| I think the other number we need to get you is, and we've texted Kim Bumpus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| is what's the average head in bed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| You know, people go out to dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| They pay for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| They go to a movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| They go to a show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| And so Kim can get us that number, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| But a large portion of the hotel motel taxes do not come to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| They go straight to visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| No, we have a fixed contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| And actually they don't get hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| They get the equivalent of hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| So if we say based on the contractual agreement, we're supposed to pay them, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| a quarter of a million dollars at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| they don't get that direct hotel motel tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| They get an equivalent of that, which really is coming out of the general fund for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| But Kitrin, I think, can answer those other questions you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I just wanted some general ideas on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| I thought it went right to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| But if it's the same amount just coming out of the general fund, to me that's about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Well, we have a service contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| And actually the state restricts what we can do with that tax type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| And so it must be used for certain things that attract and are related to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| Again, we can get a full breakdown for you if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| But they don't go directly to VK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| But we have a contract that comes before this body for their service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| And so we can get you that info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| No, it's just the concept of tourism, supporting tourism, supporting tourism, supporting tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| and just the industry within itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| I understand that there is a lot of money that comes in with that, but that little cycle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| That's all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Just a comment I wanted to share with you all first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| Thanks for this good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Thank you, Mr. Hill and Mr. Evans, for shedding some more light and answering some more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| I think it's especially relevant today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| You're voting on this 127-room hotel, which is going to turn an empty lot into a revenue-earning asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2673)|
| 0:44:44| And that asset is not just about what's good for the people who own it or for the visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| Because today we also had a ribbon-cutting for a 192-unit affordable housing complex in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| And that's 192 households that we are contributing almost a million dollars, the city, local dollars, towards the financing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| So when we put these pilots in, it's an investment so we can do these things that help out people who need that extra help for affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2704)|
| 0:45:15| So it all works together when our economy is strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| That helps us for the people who aren't always flourishing as well as we hope them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| So today's celebration at Moss Grove was really heartwarming because we desperately need those affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| It's for vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| It's 30% are set aside for the lowest income among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| And it's all for low to moderate income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| And you can walk to jobs, and those employers are going to have employees really close by and close to transit, close to good schools and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| So I'm just saying I'm glad that this is on the same day because it is all connected and one thing helps the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| So, Mr. Evans, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| So the hotel-motel tax, the majority of it that we bring in in the CBID, goes to pay down the debt, some of the debt specific to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2763)|
| 0:46:14| And so my understanding in the years that I've been on council, we have paid down that debt faster than originally anticipated because of the revenues that were greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2774)|
| 0:46:25| I think, ma'am, you're primarily talking about the tourism development zone, TDZ dollars that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| And, yes, those go toward paying off the convention center, and there is a portion of the hotel-motel tax that goes toward that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| And you're right, we are ahead of schedule somewhat on paying off the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| So this development would help eat into that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| It would make a contribution to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| And one other thing that just came up, Mr. Hill, I might ask for clarity from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| You came to a calculation there that maybe I guess was pulled specifically from the packet, the $211,000 figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2821)|
| 0:47:10| I don't want to quote you on the number, but I believe that's what you said in response to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| Yes, that was in year four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| But I think that is not to be assumed to go directly into one individual's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| It could be spread out over and it's paid to employees and bills and many, many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| I just didn't want to leave that floating out in the air that people who heard that think one singular individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| or maybe even two, are walking around with a $211,000 paycheck, because that ain't so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| And remember, we've often removed blight with public-private partnerships like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| and many people consider surface parking lots blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| So we're taking away another surface parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Appreciate the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=2882)|

| 0:53:32| And this is just a really critical piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| And I'm excited to see the ground get broken and these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3215)|

| 0:53:43| I don't have much to add to those eloquent words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| But this is a project that's been talked about for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| Further into earlier administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| And I'm glad to see that it's actually taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| And it's going to do a lot, really, to kind of transform that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| And the area, it will complement very well St. Mary's redevelopment there and also be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| a good connection between the 4th and 5th District there at the Broadway Shopping Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| which is kind of the commercial hub of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3255)|

| 0:55:02| And I think maybe the folks at home might want to know sort of what we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| with these next six items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Council Member Roberto, be glad to answer those questions or to provide an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| We do have six items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| If you could just introduce yourself, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| I know who you are, but just for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| I'm Mark Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| I am Chief Financial Officer for the Knoxville Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I live at 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| So we do have six items on the agenda tonight, starting with the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| It is for the issuance, requesting your authority for the issuance of $55 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| in long-term revenue bonds for our electric system, which will go to fund extensions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| improvements to our electrical distribution system for the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| We have a $97 million electric system capital budget this fiscal year, and this will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| fund a portion of that budget, including initial expenditures for the buildout of the fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| network that we obviously presented and discussed with Council back last summer that will enable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| us to provide broadband services and high-speed Internet services in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| So about $17 million of that will go to help fund those capital expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| So that is the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| The second item is a request to get your authorization to issue $12 million in wastewater system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| revenue bonds, and that will help fund extensions and capital improvements for our wastewater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| distribution and collection system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| In this case, not so much distribution, collection and treatment system for wastewater for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| We have a total budget of $47 million in wastewater capital for the current fiscal year, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| will fund a portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| I do want to point out, and it's true with the refunding bonds I'll talk about in just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| a moment, that all of these bonds are secured solely by the revenues of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| The city, though the bonds are required by state law to be issued in the name of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| city, the city has no obligation nor the taxpayers any obligation for the repayment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| So that's item two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| The next three items, I believe, are dealing with the refinancing of outstanding debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| We've identified a total of about $73 million in outstanding bonds that were sold back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| There's a portion of electric, water, and wastewater bonds that we can refinance at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| lower rates and thus provide a savings to KUB customers over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| The projected savings is about $8.2 million over the life of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| Now, that is spread over a pretty good period of time, 20 to 25 years, so there's a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| bit of savings each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| On a net present value basis, it totals to be about $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| So we're always looking for opportunities to be able to lower our cost of borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| and we have found another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| You may recall last year we came to council, we were refinancing over $400 million in outstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| debt, and we got $80 million in savings for our customers over the long term with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| So always looking for those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| So that's the next three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| And then the final item is the, we come to you each year, city council is required by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| state law to set the amount and provide for the allocation and distribution of electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| and gas system tax equivalents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| And for this year, we bring forth that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| I think the total amount for electric and gas combined is $23.9 million, if I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| The city's share of that is $12.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Knox County, about $10 million or $10.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| The other taxing jurisdictions combined is about $1 million on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| So we do need your approval for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| I will also point out that we do make water and wastewater in lieu of tax payments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| That's not set forth in state law, that is more governed by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| We made those payments to the city a couple of weeks ago on February the 25th, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| totaled about $8.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| So in total, what we'll pay to the city for this fiscal year is about $21.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Thank you, Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3553)|

| 0:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| And Mr. Johnson says we have to do a roll call vote on this, or I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| I guess that's been the practice for these KUB items in the past, so we'll do it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3578)|
| 0:59:47| It'll be just like when we were on Zoom, all those good days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3587)|

| 1:05:35| into a central location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| We're planning ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Right now, we count widgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| When we calculate fees, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| to look for a better solution in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| And so when we have a better solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| you won't have to hear nine different code adoptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| It'll be a singular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| You'll still hear any changes through an adjusted resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| in the future, but that's what you're hearing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| I'm happy to speak to the future stuff if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| or if you want me to come up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Well, the future stuff just is the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| that speaks to the resolution that we're coding on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3974)|
| 1:06:14| And I think what's most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| is you're not changing any of the fees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| We are not changing any of the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| It's just where they're kind of housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| This is a housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Where they are located, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| OK, and you've worked with stakeholders to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| So what you'll be hearing later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| is going to be the relocation of these fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| In addition to, we're updating our licensing requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| for trade contractors to be more in alignment with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| We have met with stakeholder groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| We've met with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| We've made adjustments based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| And we've held public meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| So that's really the only other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| We see those changes as removing barriers for smaller projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| less than $25,000, and subsequently smaller companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| And also, we see it as an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| to engage our customers more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Instead of pushing them to do work illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| we're allowing them to pull permits, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| opens the door for us to perform the inspections to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| that the installations are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| So we have a motion on the floor in a second for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| But then when the others come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| I'm going to make a motion that we pass them all collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| But we'll handle those separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| I think I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| I'll be quiet now not to confuse people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| First things first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| We'll just do this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Yeah, we'll do this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| And then we'll do the others when they come up as a batch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| I like that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| And just appreciate the input we've gotten from stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| This is going to be responsive to the people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| are trying to make their homes better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| and to try to do work on small and large scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| It's more efficient and more equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| So really glad to be bringing this to council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4080)|

| 1:10:00| I think you ought to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| to bring those items on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| Then you ought to make a motion to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| to do what Council Member just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4207)|

| 1:10:18| discussion about lumping these all into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4218)|

| 1:10:59| and jumping these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4259)|

| 1:13:21| First is Mr. John Zieda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Mr. Zieda, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| and start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| You'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| Hi, I've been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| And I'm concerned about a store business that was burned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| December 29, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| The police department, fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| stated that an individual by the name of India McDowell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| died in the store, and he lit the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| By accident or on purpose, they didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| Now, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| The police report also stated that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| was no electric in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| And I found electric multiple places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| So what I'm requesting tonight is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| that the council will make sure that the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| department or the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| will go to the family and verify if the man is dead or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| India McDowell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| When the police report says that there's no electric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| and I found electric, there's something going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| So bottom line, why I'm here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| is to make sure everybody makes sure that everyone here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| will make a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| I went to the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| to get a picture of India McDowell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| The sheriff's department gave me a bogus picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| I've still got it in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| So I'm dead serious that India McDowell, the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| of that man still alive, is very highly possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| And with some regret, with a lot of regret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| to think that the city would actually burn that store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| when I said some, it's a wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| But when you think about it, it's a great regret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| to even think that, or for me to stand here and state this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| And one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| If India McDowell is alive, that hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| that caught fire on Chapman Highway, Parkway Hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| if India McDowell is alive, the city burned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| And I expect everybody over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| to make sure that the sheriff's department looks into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| Next person signed up to speak at public forum is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Mr. Britt, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Hi, Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| I've taken the last five months to research and begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| writing a book about the lost cause and the symbolism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| of it, that it still exists in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| And some of those symbols are very readily available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| and easily identifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Just as an example, the bleak house on the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| outside the house, it is the Confederate Memorial Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| Some are physical symbols that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| just through the passage of time, have been buried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| Just as, for instance, Sharpe's Ridge, they used to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| Mr. Sharpe was a prominent Klan member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| and he used to use that mountain range to burn crosses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| and hang human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| So those are, I can trace through historical records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| I can verify that through city county documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| And with the help of Emory University, I can verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| But some of the other things that I've been researching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| are buried a little deeper and a little bit more ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| And so for the final chapter of my book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| I've been researching my own home, the previous address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| is stated, 506 Knowlton Drive, which is in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| My wife and I bought that house because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| knew we wanted our kids to live in a good school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Sequoia Elementary is the highest rated elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| in this city, in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| But it is, that neighborhood is 99% white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| and it has been since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| It used to be 100% white, so I guess it's gone down a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| And that's been perpetuated for the last 80 to 90 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| And so I started looking at why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| I looked at the previous owners of my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| and the zoning restrictions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| And I eventually get back to when my house was built in 1930| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| and when the neighborhood was established in 1926.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| The redlining was very active and prominent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| And the neighborhood that I'm in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| it's clearly stated that there is zero black people living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4697)|
| 1:18:24| there, and there's clear covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| saying that black people will never be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| to buy property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| And so you trace that forward in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| Obviously, that violates civil rights law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| so that was abolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| But then I get into 2019 when we did recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| And as a Sequoia Hills resident, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| was very adamant and a very big proponent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| for the R and 1 designation, preserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| single family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| And if you overlay the maps of redlining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| of black codes of the previous zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| and then the 2019 recode, it's impossible not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| to notice that the R and 1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| perpetuates and sustains inequality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| and structural racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| So I know it's a big ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| I know it's not a quick fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| But I would strongly encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| to reconsider the existence of the R and 1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| possibly eliminating it, replacing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| with all R and 2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| It was a mistake by me to champion that, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| But I do see we can go forward and fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| Some other municipalities have done this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| If you'd like to see any of the research I've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| I'd be happy to share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Thank you, Mr. Brett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Next person signed up to speak at public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| is Greg Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| Mr. Ducey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| Greg Ducey, Debonair Drive in the Norwood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| Wanted to start with a thank you for all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| You don't get thanked often enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| and I try to do it to all the city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| when I see them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| I'm here to ask for some help, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| make some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| We could use some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| I've spoken about this before at the Baxter Street 275 exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| As far as I can tell, it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| been six plus months where that east side coming off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| the northbound ramp roadway and sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| have been totally unfinished, very rough and unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| So not sure whose district that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| but please help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Please help the taxpayers and the people who use that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| Also, we've got some outstanding 311 operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| I know every one of them, all seven, by first name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| They probably know my Yankee voice by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| I see an area of improvement that we have enough workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| and I'm wondering, Mayor, you don't have to answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| if we could consider having some staggered lunch hours so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| that it's not shut down from noon to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| We cannot call in as taxpayers to make suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| And I wondered if possibly we could keep it open from 12 to 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| and have people go from 11.30 to 12.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Seems like a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| And finally, I'm fairly aware of the city codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| Lived here 31 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Probably violated a few of them without really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| knowing what they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Had a car that didn't run, and I got a nasty gram on the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| or was out of town, and my grass got high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| But what I found is, if you work with codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| and this is kind of a suggestion to the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| and you follow through, they'll generally work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| I see one area for improvement with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| to abandoned vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Right now, as far as I know, if you leave your garbage can out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| too long, you get 10 days to put it back where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| You get a letter, so they let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| If your yard is overgrown, you get 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| You get a letter, and if you don't get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| they'll charge you and add it to your property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| But what I believe is still the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| is you get a sticker on a car that has some value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| and you have to get it moved generally within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| I don't believe they send out a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| And if you don't move it or you're out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| it could get towed away, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| And where does it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| It goes to the impound yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Those are sold, and profit is made off a very valuable car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| It could be valuable, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| And so what I'm suggesting is we might consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| giving 14 to 21 days and a written letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| to those people who have cars so that they have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| to repair them, get a license plate, and they'll sell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| and clean up our yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| It's a whole different issue when they're on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| The police handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Speaking of the police, quickly, Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| You and I have been working on an issue, a safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| issue on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| I've been very frustrated before I worked with Chief on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| And I can tell you, Chief, that problem, that safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| issue is 100% resolved because of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| And you know which issue I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| Mr. Weth and the public service folks have been busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Thanks to Councilman Smith, and particularly Beth Goodman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| myself, and others who worked very hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| along with city employees Stephen Allen, Adam Cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| Keith Turner, and Markham Lenham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| They were down at the corner of Merrillville Pike and Ogle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| cleaning up that eyesore of car tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| from a business that just got abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| They took care of that last week and were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| really appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| Also wanted to compliment another codes inspector, Renee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| Wyatt, who's been working in the Norwood area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| to clean up yards, abandon cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5098)|

| 1:25:46| Jason Amos Oaks, 2905 Bellevue Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| I wanted to invite everybody to an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| we're having on first Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Community Television of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| is changing their name to Knoxville Community Media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| And we've got a lot of exciting things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| So we'd love to share some of our ideas with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| I moved here in 1989, and my father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| was getting his doctorate at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| And he had a project that involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| video in the classroom, which was kind of a new concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| And he found out that you could volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| to operate a camera at city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| So he told me about that, and I came down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| and started coming to city council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| on Tuesday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| We used to lug these gigantic cameras out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| There were three up here and one that was kept behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| And I did that for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| and it turned into a part-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| And I worked here Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| And a lot of commission meetings, a lot of city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Moved away and went to graduate school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| Video really informed my personal art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| and it became an integral part of everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| I did in the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| And went to graduate school in Los Angeles and came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| and ended up getting a full-time job at CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| and eventually became the director this past June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| So we are very aware that people are cutting cable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5239)|
| 1:27:26| and we want to explore other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| to connect with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| We want to work in media literacy and digital arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| do a lot of workshops related to storytelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| and we want to always keep our doors open to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| I think everyone here should have their own show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| I think Mr. Brace has his own show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| I've watched it several times, the public officer show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| Yeah, we've got a best of collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| so if you've expired everything on Netflix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220308?start=5273)|
