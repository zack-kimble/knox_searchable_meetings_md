| 0:01:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=90)|

| 0:01:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=98)|

| 0:01:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=100)|

| 0:01:48| Are there any items to be postponed for tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=108)|

| 0:01:59| Is there a motion on the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Well, we will hold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| I'll go ahead and, if it's okay with council, I'll go ahead and give my mayor's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| because that doesn't require a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| I don't have a mayor's report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| There's one piece of big news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| But I will just share that, based on conversations I've had with Vice Mayor Smith and with our UT partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=141)|
| 0:02:32| there is, as you know, a parade that's going to be starting in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| followed by a celebration on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| This is a big deal for our community, and I'm happy to help host this celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| And I want to invite council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| I'm going to be giving a proclamation on Market Square on stage with the team and coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| surrounded by a bunch of fans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| So based on my conversations with Vice Mayor Smith, we plan to call a recess at around 625,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=177)|
| 0:03:07| so everyone on council and anyone else from city staff or interested members of the audience are welcome to walk out to Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=187)|
| 0:03:15| and enjoy the festivities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| And then we'll reconvene, you know, I'm thinking 715, you know, 45 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| By the time we walk there and walk back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| So that is the current working plan, and we anticipate being able to conduct some of the city's business before that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=208)|
| 0:03:37| and then anything that remains on the agenda will proceed as soon as we reconvene at around 715.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| So that's the current working plan, and that does it for my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Any reports from council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Just three items since we have a couple minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Last week council met to review development incentives as part of a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| The public can view that on the city council website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| I encourage you to look at the packet materials that were presented at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| The second item was also last week the South Waterfront Advisory and Advocacy Committee group met at Kearns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| to review a lot of the southwest corridor, Blount Avenue area, downriver area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| So I encourage anybody in the public who's interested in that material to go to the city's website and search for connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| There's an entire page with hundreds of more pages associated to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| So that's a very important plan for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| And the third item is to wish Councilwoman Parker an early birthday in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I'd just like to take a minute to welcome Ben Collette, who is here from West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| He's here as a part of his merit badge requirement for seeking his Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| So I just want to say congratulations to him on pursuing that Eagle Scout and welcome to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Council Member Parker, is your light on for a committee council member report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| Or is that inadvertent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| I just wanted to clarify what was covered under Item 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| Yes, we're going to go back and do that since we didn't want to take any votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| We haven't done Item 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| No, we wanted to start a little early because we're going to take a recess for people to go partake in the celebrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| But we didn't want to do any votes before 6, so we will make sure to go over that now as soon as council member reports are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=346)|
| 0:05:57| Any other council member reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| We'll go back and I think I mistakenly asked for a vote on the approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Let's just redo that now that everybody's here and it's after 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Is there a motion on the minutes from the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| Motion to approve has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Now we'll go to Item 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Are there any items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| Are there any items requested to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Is there a motion on the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Oh, Council Member Parker, did you have your light on to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Yeah, I was going to make a motion to add items to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Which items would you like to move to add to the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| I cannot see them in front of me, sorry, but the ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| All of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| So items 9A through G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| And I do not believe anyone has signed up to speak to those items, which is what I look to to determine whether to support a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=432)|
| 0:07:25| And so I'd like to support one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=448)|

| 0:07:57| The consent agenda carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| We've already done the mayor's report and reports of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Did we want Vice Mayor to offer public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| I think we'll proceed for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=487)|

| 0:12:13| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| I had a question for Ms. Ely on this, but I'm not sure if she is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=736)|
| 0:12:28| I don't see her present, so I'm afraid she might not be available, but it is first reading, so if there's some questions you can share between now and second reading, I'm sure she could respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=748)|
| 0:12:40| Essentially, I'm a little confused by the pay raise for the recreation interns while there are summer workers, umpires, coaches, camp leaders that aren't getting the raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=760)|
| 0:12:57| So I was just hoping to hear some of the rationale behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| I can't answer those questions right now, but I know our CFO, Boyce Evans, gave some preliminary information, but I think Cheryl Ely will be able to provide a little bit more understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=783)|
| 0:13:17| Unfortunately, she's not present tonight, but we can get some answers to you and the rest of Council later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=797)|

| 0:13:30| Council Member Helsley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| You may need your microphone on, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I'm sorry. It just says they were inadvertently omitted, so, I mean, they're just correcting a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| Well, I guess I understand. Yeah, I agree. That's why we're making the change, because this was already passed once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| But I guess Council Member Parker's question was why these positions and not some others, or were some others getting some raises but not, you know, just a fuller understanding of that, which is a fair question, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=834)|
| 0:14:08| I don't know those details just yet, but I'm confident, you know, Director Ely knows those details and can provide them, but just not tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=848)|
| 0:14:20| All right. Any further questions or discussion on Item 12A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=860)|

| 0:14:40| We have two people signed up to speak at public forum, and first is Martha Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| Ms. Olson, if you could come up to the podium, please turn the microphone on, and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=886)|
| 0:14:58| It's on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Yes, my name is Martha Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| The address is 2809 Scottish Pike in the South Waterfront area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| I was here a few weeks ago and didn't get to speak, but I learned a lot during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| The most touching part was a speech by Ben Bentley of KCDC in which he described the plans for reimagining Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=913)|
| 0:15:23| He described a vision of a community of people from all walks of life and all incomes that were supporting each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| As he spoke, it began to sound more and more familiar, and then I realized he could be describing my neighborhood, and it's already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=931)|
| 0:15:42| I'm here today because of a news story that you all will be receiving reports about my neighborhood on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| I'm not sure if it's last Tuesday or next Tuesday or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| If you haven't received it yet, there is a post dated June 10th on the Knox Views blog, which provides links to three different reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=952)|
| 0:16:05| As you read the reports, you will encounter a pie chart in several different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| This is the largest version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| On the upper right, it says, Mixed Use and Mixed Income Development that Maintains Neighborhood Character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=975)|
| 0:16:28| Then the quote that you don't see on all the pie charts, but on the big one, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| Controlled Growth in a Positive Direction that Will Allow Families of Any Income Bracket to Be Part of Our Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=993)|
| 0:16:42| I assume the quotes came from a public workshop at the Kirbala Temple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| You may note that this is secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Actually, the first thing was preserving green spaces and have some new cool businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| That was the most popular, 37 to 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Then there were some comments about providing adequate infrastructure for population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1020)|
| 0:17:10| This was a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| It might be a good time to mention that the rate of population growth in Knoxville proper is beginning to slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| But I want to direct you especially to the quote below it about parking options, a trolley route, and transit from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1041)|
| 0:17:32| That's the kind of infrastructure the public was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| Back to the label on the pie chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Mixed Use and Mixed Income Development that Maintains the Neighborhood Character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| This one flummoxed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| In what world do these high-density developments maintain the character of our neighborhood of single-family homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1068)|
| 0:17:58| I'm reminded of an old saying that's rated R, but you can Google it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Don't blank and tell me it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| When you see that slogan, I want you to remember what's underneath it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| controlled growth in a positive direction that will allow families of any income bracket to be part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| Now, I'm personally happy to be welcoming neighbors into the industrial sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| but we do need the city to work with the neighborhood about addressing the traffic flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1104)|

| 0:18:39| and route outgoing traffic through a quiet neighborhood, over railroad tracks, and where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1119)|
| 0:18:48| Maybe a steep slope to a secondary traffic light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Nobody came to us first and asked our ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| And I'd like to mention to the mayor that this would be equivalent of making Broadway one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| and routing half of the traffic down Luttrell Street in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1144)|

| 0:19:17| But this is what they proposed to us, and you can see that in page 115 of one of the reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1157)|
| 0:19:28| and it's also a little bit bigger scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| You have to look closely on page 131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| So that's just something that's probably my biggest concern at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| And so it just feels like an example of the city officials ignoring existing residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240625?start=1181)|
