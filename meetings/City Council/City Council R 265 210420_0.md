| 0:09:09| The community wanted them, KPD wanted them, and thanks to your support, we approved them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=549)|

| 0:09:27| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Transparency also means timely, not six or 18 months later, but as soon after an incident as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=575)|

| 0:10:33| state of the city luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=633)|

| 0:10:40| want to make sure that we're sharing more information with you and all the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=640)|

| 0:14:57| I want to personally thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Mr. Nance couldn't be here due to a previous commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| but I'm sure most of you are familiar with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| and his commitment to our city from past experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| I want to thank the members of the nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| for your willingness to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| and represent our community on the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| This is a really important role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| This group is tasked with doing a deep study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| of a proposed publicly owned sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| and entertainment stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| If the proposal moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| you all, this panel, this sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| will lead its financing, construction, and management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| As I've said publicly in considering this investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| the public benefit has to be greater than the public cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Our initial research shows that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| It has the potential to tie together downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| the old city, and East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| while bringing a mostly vacant area back into reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| and creating new jobs and economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| I would like, if you wouldn't mind, council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| to ask the six members who were able to be with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| here tonight to quickly introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| I'll start with, I guess, alphabetically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Joan Cronin, I see you on top of my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| If you want to just say hello and introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Good. Joan Cronin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| I'm a longtime women's athletic director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| athletic director emeritus at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| to, if approved, to work with the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| I love sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| I've written a book about sport is life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| but the volume turned up, and I think this support center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| could turn the volume up in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| so I look very much forward to doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=998)|

| 0:16:53| In 1983, I left Knoxville and moved to Maryland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| to accept a position with the First National Bank of Maryland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| While there, I worked in the corporate trust division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| and was very much involved with the Maryland Stadium Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| that they were for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| for the construction of Oriole Park and Cannon Yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| and then later, M&T Bank Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I went on to serve as trustee for over 20 projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| from the Maryland Stadium Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1034)|

| 0:17:19| which is a minor league team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| I recently retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| We have two daughters that both attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| the University of Tennessee, got their graduate degrees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| and continued staying in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| and are now working here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| It was easy then to convince my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| it was time for me to move back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| We live in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| When I started hearing about the sports authority being formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| I knew that based on my experience, my knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| of these types of finances and how they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| I felt like I could contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I think this is a very fine group of diverse people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| with diverse backgrounds and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| and I'm very honored and happy to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1075)|

| 0:18:38| But I'm super excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1118)|

| 0:25:13| I liken it more to building an airplane while in flight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1513)|

| 0:26:11| community too often left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| That cannot be allowed to happen this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Many in my community have misgivings about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| They don't know what to expect, and based on too many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| past experiences, they are mistrustful of what lies ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| With solid commitments for deliverables, that mistrust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1596)|

| 0:27:53| It must be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1673)|

| 0:28:22| So allow me to thank you again, the nominees to the sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| authority for the time you will find yourself spending on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| worthy and most important undertaking in the heart of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| And again, congratulations and condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| There is a lot of work ahead, and you will find many partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you, Mr. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Mayor, actually, I was just given a little salute to Yotus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| There's nobody else that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| Councilmember Ryder and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| So can we have a little overview about how it works from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| point, like how the sports authority works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| What happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I'm going to turn this over to my deputy who's been leading this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| is Stephanie Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Please, Stephanie, if you could give an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Thanks, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| And thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| So I think the first thing that we're going to be doing is getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| to know each other a little bit and getting some background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| information on the project and understanding the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| listening to the community and listening to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| So the first thing that we're going to be doing is getting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| know what the sports authority will be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| The work really starts after some authorization from city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| So as we've discussed previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| the sports authority will be throughout the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| reviewing development agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| reviewing lease agreements that we've already begun discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| We will be working with the sports authority to really think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| through and make sure that those agreements are really rock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| We will be working to do an economic impact analysis and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| bringing that to the sports authority for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| So it will be a lot of review and input and research that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| board will bring to bear on those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| We'll be bringing those documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| including a financing plan to both city council and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| commission with an interlocal agreement that will be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| agreement between the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| the county and the sports authority that will authorize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| financing for the project and will basically be the go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| That interlocal agreement will be accompanied by the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| agreement and the lease agreement and the financing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| So council and county commission will have an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| review all of those and then give the sports authority the go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| ahead to move forward with that financing plan and finalize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| development agreement and the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| And then from that point forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| the sports authority will be managing that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| So they'll be issuing the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| They will be managing the development agreement and the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| And as the project is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| they will take ownership of the stadium on behalf of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| The city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I hope that answers your question and it may have actually been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| more information than you were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Council member writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| I'd like to talk about the authority that the sports authority would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| As soon as we appoint members to the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Do you have a particular question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| Or you just want an overview of what authority they will have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Well, according to the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| The sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| Essentially charter that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Passed. It seems like as soon as we appoint members of the sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| They are empowered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| To move forward with acquiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Without our approval. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Council member Parker, the sports authority doesn't have any funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| So the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Authority of the sports authority board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| Is going to be contingent on funding that would have to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| and a financing plan that would have to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| By council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| So if they were to acquire the land through a gift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Would they be able to do anything with that land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| If the land were just simply gifted to the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| They wouldn't have any resources to do anything with that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| Some of my concerns are that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| A stop in the demolition work at the current site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| Rumored to be because of environmental concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2043)|
| 0:34:11| We have yet to see any impact studies for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| economic impact, environmental impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| And my concern would be if land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| For free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| And then we are then held liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| And not able to negotiate a better deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Because the land has already been acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Council member Parker, I think this would be one of the many things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| the sports authority addresses and deals with before moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| That's why we are appointing a panel with such great variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| To make sure the city's interests are protected and that we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| And make investments that are not to the public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| So those kinds of due diligence things will be things that they look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| before, you know, before getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Anything that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| We'd have any risk at all. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Well, I do believe that we have a responsibility as elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| representatives to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Ensure that we are not transferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Authority to a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| When we are elected to represent individuals who are still waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| for their opportunity for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| Still waiting for a proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Public forum where they can engage with questions that do not have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| We still haven't engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| The public around whether this should even be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| A project that we use city dollars county dollars towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| As a as a city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| We've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| When we authorize the formation of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| Last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| That we also as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Have an opportunity to decide whether we want to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| As partners in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| So we are also following this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| To determine whether this is something that the city should be committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Because as we've been told the county can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Without the city's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| So I feel like these are questions that we as a city council have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Before members are appointed to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| Other questions I have are about, um, community benefits agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| We've heard, uh, some, uh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| Of the nominees express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Support that there be a benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| However, the community is calling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| If this project is to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| A strong community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| And that is a legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| That should be in place between one community legal entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| And, uh, this, uh, Boyd sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| And I wanted to ask the nominees if they're committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| To ensuring there is a legal community benefits agreement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Before they would move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| If the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| I'm not sure if the panelists are, uh, prepared to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| I'm not sure if someone wants to. They may, uh, but, um, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| they were here just to introduce themselves tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Share their experiences, and these are the kinds of issues they'll delve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| into if they're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Mm hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I would expect that the nominees would be open to answering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| And this is not less than introduction that we're actually able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| I'm not sure if we can assess the nominees and decide on whether we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| to vote for them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| I'll see if any of them wish to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Let me know. Unmute yourself and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Miss Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| You unmuted yourself. So if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| I've read up on the community benefits agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Just to sort of, um, become knowledgeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| So I think that's something that I know that I've talked to Mark mammoth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| off about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Uh, and the possibility. So I've gone on the website and I've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Nashville's and I've looked at other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| To see what type of community benefits they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| So I'm definitely open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Uh, about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| I would have to dig down and see what really not full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| And to be a part of that. So I can't give you an answer, but definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| I've talked about it. I've reached out to people to find out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| I've gone on the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| To try to find what other cities have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| A little bit familiar about it. So I'm definitely open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| And I, I, I do think that the community needs to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| Uh, from the baseball stadium, not just as far as I think there's 70 games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| That are going to be played there. So I do think that the community needs to benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| So I'm definitely open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| I'm not that familiar to really give you a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| An answer, but definitely I have researched it and I've had conversations about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you. Would anyone else like to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| Miss Tillman, you're unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| From my standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| And I'm looking at, um, involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Based on community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| I had the opportunity early on to, um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| Find out about a little bit more about the stadium and what was planned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And, and my point to that was that I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| As an educator, I wanted students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Adult students, traditional students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| I wanted the community that I've worked in for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| To benefit from the, um.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| That location and so, um, for me to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Uh, about a benefit statement at this point would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Erroneous. I've only been in fact, I'm not even in not so right now. I'm in Chicago with grandchildren and and so my focus has not been there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2416)|
| 0:40:27| But it will be, as I said, I think the research has to happen. We have to find it. We have to decide on what's best for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2427)|
| 0:40:36| And I believe that to be East Knoxville, of course, downtown, all of Knoxville will benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| But I think at this point, it's early for me to say this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| But for sure, this is what we're going to research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| And certainly we wanted to benefit our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| And Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Mr Bass, did you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Yes, I would just like to add that I certainly am open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| To understanding and delving into the community impact statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| My experience was in Baltimore and Oriel Park was built in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| It was outside of downtown. Prior to that, it was a tremendous impact to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| It brought a lot of people downtown, both visitors and residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| But I certainly think all the studies need to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| And for this project to go forward, it definitely has to demonstrate that it meets the needs of the public and the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| And I'm committed to researching that and making sure that from my perspective, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| Thank you, Mr. Bass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| Mr. Hill, you want to speak? Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| I would just say I concur with my fellow appointees that we're going to be open to many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| We're going to be evaluating many things. And we just don't have the information before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Thank you, Mr. Hager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Did you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Thank you. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Certainly, we all want to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| I think we all I think we all will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| I can't speak for everybody, but I and knowing this group, as I do, would be certainly open to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2545)|
| 0:42:33| We want to support all all parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| And I would I listen particularly to what Theotis Robbins said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| And that was that that certainly got my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| And I'll strive to be the kind of member that he challenged us to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| Thank you, Mr. Hager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| This is Joe Cronin, and I would just like to echo what my fellow members have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| I think this is a great opportunity, but it's it's way too early for us to commit steps, except we are we're here to serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2581)|
| 0:43:10| We're here to make this community better through this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| I had Miss Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I appreciate the responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| The only thing I would emphasize is that from my perspective on city council and the constituents that I represent, we are really calling for a legal agreement, which is much different than a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2603)|
| 0:43:39| So I just wanted to reiterate that for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| I'm obviously a single vote, like Miss Thompson has said, and I know that I'm not in the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2622)|
| 0:43:51| The only thing that I can do during these meetings are try to ask tough questions to try to emphasize the priorities that are important to community members who are reaching out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2631)|
| 0:44:04| I cannot vote in favor at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I will be abstaining because I'm worried that we are moving full steam ahead unnecessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| I believe that the public would have more trust in this process if we would slow it down and open up public conversation before we continue to make more votes that move us forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2655)|
| 0:44:30| The arguments that were made before the Senate Finance Ways and Means Committee when seeking state funding made it seem as if both city council and county commission were already in full support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2670)|
| 0:44:44| When we've been told that our votes were only so that the conversation could move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| Well, it's being lifted up as full support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| And so tonight will be another vote that will be lifted up as full support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| And it lessens our ability to negotiate the best deal for those we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| So I encourage my fellow council members to help slow down this process until more robust public discussion has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2708)|
| 0:45:19| And until we are able to see those impact studies to know if this project should even move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Any other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| I have some apprehensions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Not with the membership of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Everybody that's nominated I'm incredibly impressed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| What I am hesitating about is all of the workshops that we've had have included information about the financing used utilizing a tax district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2745)|
| 0:45:57| And that doesn't seem to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| There are changes being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| So I'm hoping to have those discussions and know how we're moving forward kind of before this next step happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2761)|
| 0:46:11| Ms. Welch, could you explain the latest developments in the legislation and how that affects our proposed financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Not proposed financing, but potential financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| I just wanted to mention because it provides an opportunity to talk a little bit about what's happening in our state legislature right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| So as you all are aware, part of the finance and the proposed financing plan included expanding a district in which sales tax could be collected and directed towards debt payment for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2795)|
| 0:46:51| If the stadium is built, all of the sales tax inside the stadium will be utilized with the exception of 1.5% that's returned to the state will be utilized to pay the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2811)|
| 0:47:05| And you all remember that the idea was to expand that district to include a quarter mile radius around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| After, you know, some great discussion and negotiations at the state level, I think we got actually a really good substitution for that, which is basically a direct grant up front that will be in this year's state budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2831)|
| 0:47:31| It just passed the state senate finance committee today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| It will be the equivalent of the present day value of what we had projected or estimated we would be able to collect from that district that was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2857)|
| 0:47:49| So I would say a couple things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| It's a $13.5 million grant up front that has to be used for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| So if the project doesn't move forward, because I have a feeling that question will be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| If the project doesn't move forward, those funds don't come to Knoxville because it has to be used for the stadium, for a stadium, for this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2882)|
| 0:48:12| And that $13.5 million is money that we get up front that would reduce the amount of funding that would have to be borrowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2892)|
| 0:48:22| And it would be the present day value equivalent to what we projected we would be able to secure through that tax district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2902)|
| 0:48:32| It does not change the financing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| It's, you know, the same amount of resources, just we're getting it up front instead of over the 30-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2915)|
| 0:48:49| So I hope that answers your question, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| It helps a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| And it sounds like it's a better deal for us, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| But still, it feels like we're just now having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| And that's what a lot of my decision making so far had been based on was looking at the financing through the expansion of the tax district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| So I'm still hesitant in moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| This feels a little fast when the information we've gotten so far has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2956)|
| 0:49:25| So one thing that I might add, Councilwoman Singh, is that, I mean, my hope is that, and I feel really confident that with the group of experts that have been convened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2965)|
| 0:49:36| and the continued community input that we're receiving, that I know change doesn't always sound good, but this project will evolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2976)|
| 0:49:47| And it will evolve in a way that reflects ongoing community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| And ongoing conditions, you know, locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| So I hope that that would be something that we would embrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Because if everything were static, and everything had already been decided, and all of the plan was already final, then I would be concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3002)|
| 0:50:17| I think it's going to be really important for us to continue to listen to the community, and to listen to the experts who have been convened as part of this, you know, that you'll be voting on here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3017)|
| 0:50:28| Because that expertise, I think, will make the project even stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| I appreciate that, Deputy Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| I guess I'm just asking, like, I don't know the information about the $13 million, or the change in the tax district, through any communication from the mayor's office, or from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3037)|
| 0:50:54| I know it from reading other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| So I am just asking for more communication on this, and when things change, to let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| Because we're being asked a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| So we need to know the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| We'll try to communicate more frequently on this as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| And I do think, Deputy Welch, that we're hoping to be able to have a city-owned sort of website that shares information launched in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3078)|
| 0:51:30| It's just been a busy time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| So I'm hoping to get that up in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| I know Vice Mayor McKenzie and Councilmember Fugate, you've raised your hand before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| So we can go with Vice Mayor McKenzie and then Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| And I do want to thank the candidates that have been selected before us today to serve on the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3105)|
| 0:51:57| My question would be to Deputy Chief Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| If you will, in the event that the stadium is not approved to go forward, would the sports authority board then become defunct at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3121)|
| 0:52:14| I think we would have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| The sports authority, if this project doesn't move forward, the sports authority will not have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3136)|
| 0:52:24| So there wouldn't be a reason to keep it going forward unless there were another project that were identified in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3144)|
| 0:52:35| But no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| And to be clear, this is a volunteer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| This is not a paid board position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And as all councilmembers, we're all getting feedback and we're getting comments and we're talking to people in our communities, in our districts and across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3165)|
| 0:52:56| And they're proactively giving us feedback around their thoughts around the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3176)|
| 0:53:04| And so would the sports authority to gather for people to reach out to them with questions and comments as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| And then also when they have meetings, will those meetings be sunshine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| Good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I believe they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| And Stephanie, if you could just clarify that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| And I think, you know, I think you've raised a really good point, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| And I think this question came up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| What's going to be happening with the sports authority board over the next, you know, couple of months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| And I think one of the first things are we need to convene the board and start talking about, you know, the best methods of communication and how people can be accessed and public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3222)|
| 0:53:55| And so I think that's important to Council and for County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| So that's going to be central to sort of the operating procedures for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Any further questions at this point, Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| First of all, to those of you who have agreed to serve, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| Secondly, I think a lot of the points that my colleagues are bringing up are valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| But I do believe we said in the very beginning, some of the answers to these questions can't really happen until we have a body that can begin negotiating on behalf of the city and the county, which is why we created the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3267)|
| 0:54:44| So I look forward to your doing your work in public and the live day where people can hear, know and participate and look forward to your good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3284)|
| 0:54:55| And nothing is done until we vote the money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| I just think everybody needs to be really clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| The sports authority people being named is one more step because we need that body to actually negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| When it is a agreement between the city and the county, there has to be another body doing the doing the work for both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3314)|
| 0:55:25| The city can't just do it ourselves if the county is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| So I appreciate the sports authority members being willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| And I plan to support this fabulous slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you, Council Member Fugett. We'll go to Council Member Smith and then Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| Yeah, I want to echo Councilwoman Fugett's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| This is a well-qualified slate of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| And I'm really proud to have you all represented in this next step, which is just negotiation and more education on what decision will become back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3351)|
| 0:56:02| I had a follow up question regarding community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Deputy Welch, can you just refresh what community input opportunities have been provided and what opportunities will be provided as it relates to at least the administration and council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3366)|
| 0:56:20| Obviously, I think earlier you said not sure what the input process will be in the cadence for this sports authority, but for the administration and for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3380)|
| 0:56:30| Give us an update on what community input opportunities there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Great. Thanks, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| So we've been meeting with a variety of community organizations at least weekly, a couple times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3396)|
| 0:56:45| Most weeks we have a community organization that either will reach out and ask for a presentation and, you know, to provide an opportunity for discussion about the proposed stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3405)|
| 0:56:59| We've met with multiple, you know, community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| I think last week, Dean Tillman and the East Knoxville Business and Professional Association hosted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3423)|
| 0:57:11| I've reached out to several of you and will continue to reach out to all of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| If you have organizations that you'd like us to schedule a meeting with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| What I'm really looking forward to, we've obviously had the council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| We had a public information meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| But what we really need to do is start having meetings where we can have good interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3450)|
| 0:57:38| And it sometimes is challenging on Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| We've started talking with some design consultants about having an in person meeting that provides visuals that can get people down close to the site and really start to get a feel for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3461)|
| 0:57:55| To provide their input on design aspects of the site on benefits that they would like to see in the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3475)|
| 0:58:04| So those meetings will continue to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| And as we get a website up, which we project we'll have a website up next week that will have all of the information that has already been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3487)|
| 0:58:18| Meetings that have already occurred and then upcoming meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| That website will be going up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| So we'll start scheduling more community meetings, both virtually and then beginning in person as the summer progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| And just as a follow up, all of those things, all of those input points will be made available before this body votes on any funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3516)|
| 0:58:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3527)|

| 0:58:55| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| My question is asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Councilmember Roberto and then Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| I was just wondering with regard to the sports authority, what's the vision for council receiving reports going forward as we're working towards, you know, a final vote or a proposal to be reviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3547)|
| 0:59:19| to be reviewed. Are there any thoughts on reports that Council will receive in the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3559)|
| 0:59:31| We would welcome your feedback on that, Councilman Roberto. One of the things that we've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| maybe at least a few times to Council is if you would like to schedule regular workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| we can do that. If you would like to have us go out and meet in your district, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| do that. That part of that could include reports on what the Sports Authority is working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| and any other information. So we would love your feedback on that. This is, we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3598)|
| 1:00:06| at your pleasure, so. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Roberto. Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3606)|
| 1:00:15| Parker. I had a follow up question that came to mind and also a comment that just popped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3615)|
| 1:00:23| in mind in response to the last question. I've been in talks with the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3623)|
| 1:00:31| about scheduling a public meeting, but I've held back on scheduling the public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| because there are no answers yet. When we have these discussions, the information is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3637)|
| 1:00:45| the same as a couple of months ago. We're all waiting on the economic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I'd like to see an environmental impact study. I'd like to see a larger community impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| study. Those take months and months and months and months to do. So we need answers to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3653)|
| 1:01:03| real engagement with the public. If we're going to tell them the same update we keep telling them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3663)|
| 1:01:13| then I don't think it's really a good use of time to hold those public meetings when we know we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| not going to have the answers until July, I believe they said, during the Finance, Ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| and Means Committee is when we might see an economic impact study. So to me, that's when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| the conversation should begin. We'll get that study in, but all I can do is offer my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3690)|
| 1:01:38| and my vote. But my question is, do any of the nominees have plans to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3698)|
| 1:01:47| in the private development planned for the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| If I hear anyone want to speak to that, if you have plans, you can speak up if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| your silence indicates you don't have plans to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| So nobody's everybody's shaking. They're not shaking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| Councilman Parker, it may be fitting for me to respond to that, but I don't have any plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| as a developer to invest in this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| And I guess Mark Mamatov is not on the phone tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| I just wondered if we had a lawyer on the call who could tell us whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| the charter would prevent appointed members from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| making financial investments related to their role in the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3760)|
| 1:02:50| Ms. Welcher, I noticed Mr. Bass unmuted himself. If either of you want to speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| I imagine it does, but if it doesn't, we should make sure it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| I just wanted to add I have no plans to invest in this project in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| Mr. Swanson has turned his camera off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| Okay, sorry. He's on my page two there, so I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| Sorry, Mr. Swanson, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Yes, I can speak to that. There are state laws with regard to public conflicts of interest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| will come into play here, and so these members of the sports authority may not violate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| state laws with regard to conflicts of interest, and I'm sure we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| monitor that and make sure that that continues to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Thank you for that answer. That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| Okay. Any other council members with questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| I just want to say I think this has been a good discussion, but I would also like to commend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| both administrations for putting together what I feel like is a very thoughtful and really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3833)|

| 1:04:16| that they will, you know, they have the interest of our city at heart. I think they have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| interest of all of our residents at heart in every sector of the city, so I'm excited to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| what their dialogue and what those conversations have as they start to convene and have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| meetings and we start to move forward. So, you know, I just I think it's a wonderful and positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| thing, and I just I wanted to state that. Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=3882)|

| 1:13:18| Uh, yes, Mayor, this is on a second reading, of course, and there's a reason why we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| second readings, and that is to give us time to reflect on previous votes to decide whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| not we want to make it binding. Of course, I thought it was quite clear. I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| first vote that we made was a mistake. It was a mistake for my district. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| um, I've got kind of a saying I like, that an error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4422)|
| 1:13:52| to correct it. And I think here we have an opportunity to correct a mistake for my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| And I have lived in my district about 39 years. I think I know what the needs are of that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| And what the needs are on Broadway is to have a, a corridor that's less brutally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4447)|
| 1:14:18| unpedestrian friendly than what we have. This rezoning is a step to gut that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4458)|
| 1:14:27| it's going to have a domino effect. And it's going to destroy a lot of the efforts that I've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| over years to try to address these needs on Broadway. What Broadway doesn't need is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4472)|
| 1:14:41| place to change your oil in the car. That's a valid, valid business. You know, I have a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| I have my oil changed. But there is no lack of places to have your oil changed on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| Personally, I go to Fisher Tire, it's a family owned business, it's up the road. Sometimes I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| to Jiffy Lube. I counted the places on Broadway from this riders district, and mine, or our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4501)|
| 1:15:11| residence location, up to the site of where this proposed business would be and I counted at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| 10 places, you could get your oil changed. So what we're going to be doing here, if this continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| is you are going to gut opportunities to start the process of making this corridor somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4525)|
| 1:15:37| more pedestrian friendly, which is what my district needs. And you're going to allow it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| to be rezoned to put another oil change place in there, which my district does not need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4543)|
| 1:15:51| So there was a lot made about, well, we want to be consistent. Well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| what they say about foolish consistencies, and this is a foolish consistency. I like to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| consistent too, but I don't like to be wrongly consistent. And to compare and set as a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| something that happened over on Kingston Pike, in West Knoxville, in the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| and pretend that that should act as a precedent for the fifth district over in Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| makes me think that my colleagues really don't know their city very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4586)|
| 1:16:35| So having said that, I will vote no. It's a strong no, and I'm giving my colleagues a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| correct a mistake. In the vote on Kingston Pike, Councilman Smith was the only one that voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| against that rezoning on first reading, and he actually was the only one of us that got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| And so all I'm asking to do is let me continue to work in my district and meet those needs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4618)|
| 1:17:07| I know it has, as opposed to kind of encouraging needs that it doesn't have. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4627)|

| 1:17:24| because I do like to take the lead of the councilperson, the representative for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| district, and I'm also glad that we have two readings. I hear everything that Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4651)|
| 1:17:40| Thomas is saying, and the 15-year lease is what concerns me, that we're making a permanent change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4660)|
| 1:17:50| that is not along the path that we have been working towards for a 15-year lease. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| if it was longer. So we're making a permanent decision on a very short-term lease. So I'm also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| not in favor of this. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Singh. Any other comments or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4682)|

| 1:18:20| personal at all. I feel like my vote, my position on this was looking at the depth and the quantity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4700)|
| 1:18:29| of the C-1 zoning in that particular area. If it had been in a slightly different position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| closer to residential, I would see it differently. My point, and I promise you it's not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4716)|
| 1:18:45| It's just when I look at the C-2 and the C-3 zoning creates walkable downtown areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4725)|
| 1:18:58| like our downtown. It moves the buildings up close. Is Ms. Brooks on? Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| Director Brooks is on. Ms. Brooks, could you speak to Ms. Ryder's question? Or could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| repeat the question to make sure? Ms. Ryder, could you just restate the question to make sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4752)|
| 1:19:20| So, Ms. Brooks, what's the setbacks of the C-2 versus the C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| Give me a minute and I will pull it up. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| So, in the C-1, there's no front setback. C-2, there's a, in C-3, there are build-to zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4769)|
| 1:19:44| of zero to 20 feet. That's the, and then there's height, maximum building height in the C-1 is 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| and then in the C-2 and C-3, you can go up to 70 feet in C-2 and unlimited in C-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| Does that answer your question, Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| So, the building can be 20 feet back, not contingent upon the height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| Correct. Well, it does have to be set back, for C-2 specifically, at 70 feet. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4806)|
| 1:20:16| structures must be set back an additional one foot for every two feet of height over 45 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| from any required setback. Okay. I will say my concern is that by applying C-2 as liberally as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4820)|
| 1:20:34| we have from 5th Avenue basically all the way to the county line, and let me not misstate, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4834)|
| 1:20:44| to pull up the map before I say that. Councilman Thomas, my concern is creating areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4844)|
| 1:20:53| disinvestment, and I talked to developers, particularly after the vote of the one over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| off Kingston Pike, and I hear you. You don't think they're comparable. The difference is that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4858)|
| 1:21:05| willing to invest more money in West Knoxville than they are in North Knoxville. I am familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| with the area, and one of the things people say all the time is, why can't we get X over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| and they get it over there, and it's because they're not willing to invest the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| in certain amounts of town because we don't have the dollars that drive the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| I don't want to have areas and pockets of disinvestment while we wait 20 years for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| development to catch up with us. I don't believe that zoning is the only tool that's going to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| the development that we want to see, that the zoning by itself is going to make it happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| so it is in no disrespect to your opinion or your viewpoint or your experience in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| or the district. I'm just concerned about, you know, disinvestment in a large quantity of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| liberally applied over miles and miles of a stretch of road, and that particular parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| doesn't abut residential, and that's how I came to my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| I'm concerned about investment too, but I'm concerned about the investment that that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| needs. There's no lack of investment on that section of the road over there, and I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4934)|
| 1:22:22| much rather have a little patience. The applicant here hasn't even bought the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| I would much rather for my district have a little patience and let other investors come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4948)|
| 1:22:35| That would be prime property for other things, and let them provide something that that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| needs, and it doesn't need. I don't have anything against oil change places. I have a car. I get my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| oil changed. Everybody needs one, but that section has plenty of places for my residents to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4968)|
| 1:22:57| their oil, and I don't know why we can't have a little patience and wait for an investor to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| in that actually provides something that my district would like, and I have a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4983)|
| 1:23:12| Ms. Brooks if she's still on. Ms. Brooks? Yes. Ms. Brooks, what was the planning staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=4992)|
| 1:23:21| recommendation on this zoning? Planning staff recommended denial on this one. Okay. Based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5001)|
| 1:23:31| upon the planning staff's recommendation, I am voting consistently with our planning staff, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5011)|
| 1:23:40| Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Council Member Smith, and then Parker Dunfuget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| Justin Brooks, if you're still there, I have a question related to walkability. Can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| describe the planning staff's perspective regarding walkability between CG1 and CG2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5032)|
| 1:24:05| The orientation of the buildings can promote, the location and orientation of buildings can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5045)|
| 1:24:12| promote increased walkability. I wouldn't say specifically, you know, there are some properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| within the CG1 that are located in areas that are walkable. I mean, there's a number of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| factors that play into it. Zoning is just one piece of it in terms of making a place walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| I mean, it's the sidewalks. It's whether or not there's a buffer on the sidewalks from the travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| lane. So it's really case by case. I wouldn't say that all CG1 is going to make a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5072)|
| 1:24:41| not friendly and unwalkable. But I wouldn't, I would say, again, it's an incremental approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5081)|
| 1:24:50| I'm not sure if I'm answering your question, but... Well, it's a pretty general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| vague question, but I want to understand significantly. I value Council Member Thomas's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| perspective on his district. Particularly, I value the feeling of a village and the walkability of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| local shops and businesses and the connectivity that makes a community what it is. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5107)|
| 1:25:16| one of the questions I've been thinking hard about is, does this prohibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| the connected walkability of this area? And that is a very broad question, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5120)|
| 1:25:30| generally speaking, I know that walkability is important for what Council Member Thomas's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5130)|
| 1:25:37| wanting for the people he represents. So that's what was driving my question. That was a sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| answer. I don't have any more detail that I need, but if you have anything else to add, I'm all ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| Again, it goes back to the use. So CG, all the CG zones allow similar uses. It's just where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| placement of the individual building is on the property. And yes, I would say that the placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| of that building is very important. And the location of, if you're going to have drive-throughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| to support the use of the property, you know, it can impact whether or not it's accessible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| pedestrians. And it's a friendly place for pedestrians to be. So it really is site-specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| and use-specific. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Council, before I move to Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| and then Fugate, I just want to let you know that Attorney Ben Mullins is representing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| party in this, and he's on the call if you have questions for him. Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| I actually did have a quick question for Ben Mullins, if he doesn't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| since it was brought up. A comparison to the previous project that we discussed on Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5204)|
| 1:26:53| Pike. I was wondering if that property was a lease agreement or the property was owned by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5213)|
| 1:27:01| the business in that situation on Kingston Pike. I believe, if I remember correctly, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| Kingston Pike property, they were purchasing the property there. I think our applicant would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| like to purchase the property here. However, the owner has only made it available for a ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| lease. So the initial term is 15 years, and there are renewal terms beyond that, but they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| making a significant investment in the property. And this site plan is actually going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| planning staff right now for site plan approval. And there's a question of what access will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5253)|
| 1:27:42| allowed onto North Broadway or whether that would be only allowed on the side alley because of TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| regulations. And we know we're also going to have to do sidewalks along the frontage as well to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| promote walkability, even though this is a vehicle-oriented business. So I hope that answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| your question, Council Member Parker. That is helpful. Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| One, I'm really appreciative of Council Member Thomas's continued advocacy for his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5286)|
| 1:28:18| I appreciate advocacy for community. For me, I wanted to share how I reached my decision, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5298)|
| 1:28:26| during the discussion about the property at Kingston Pike, which it does seem, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| in my mind, has set a precedent. And I, you know, during that conversation, I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| concerned about the zoning change and asked questions about the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| of some of our new zoning regulations in terms of its impact on walkability, of its impact on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| you know, slowing down traffic. And it just didn't seem during that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5335)|
| 1:29:03| that that was a critical factor in being able to achieve the walkability that a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| sought. Because when I think about the area that on Kingston Pike, where we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| you know, discussed the last project, I think of that as an area that definitely has walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| even though there's a lot of traffic there. There are a lot of places to walk to. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| wanted to clarify that I definitely see your arguments. I see that there are differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| I also see a lot of similarities. So I'm struggling to move away from my previous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5374)|
| 1:29:43| Thank you, Council Member Parker. Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| Thank you, Mayor. I'm not sure who can answer this for me, and I apologize that I cannot remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| But what is the current setback for the current building that is sitting on the property now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5394)|
| 1:30:03| I can answer that question. I did a measurement of it, and it's in the letters I believe I provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| to Council previously. And the current building right now is set back, and I just did, I did this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| by a KGIS measurement. So it's not going to be exactly right, but it's going to get us close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| enough. And I had it being set back from the right-of-way of 28 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5423)|
| 1:30:31| Okay. And then my other question is, if this doesn't pass, the rezoning doesn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5431)|
| 1:30:41| what can be done with that property if it currently does not meet the C-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| zoning that has been changed? Does that mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| nothing can be changed or improved on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5455)|
| 1:31:02| Director Brooks, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| I'm sure I can give it a try. It doesn't mean nothing can happen on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| It still can be developed. It can still be used. The building that's there can still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| be utilized. Other uses can go in. There's a range of uses that are allowed in the CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| You know, an auto-oriented use like this will continue to be a challenge to be able to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| to fit the drive-throughs and other things that they need to make this particular business viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| on this piece of property. But no, I mean, it's still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| If any other business could still operate set back that far, which does not meet the C-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5499)|
| 1:31:48| guidelines. In an existing building, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| Yes, that's what I'm trying to be clear. So if nothing happens, this building will still not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| conform to the current new zoning. But it would be legal, what they call legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| non-conforming. So it would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Right. I understand that. I'm just trying to make the understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| something can happen in that building, whether it's improved or not, that will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5532)|
| 1:32:18| make anybody move it closer to the sidewalk or closer to the road. I understand Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| Thomas's point about the walkability. I happen to live in a community that's on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| highway that has sidewalks. It's a state highway with sidewalks and is very walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| But I appreciate your concern. And I drive that way a lot, about every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| And one side does have neighborhoods, and this side does not. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| I understand your concern. But I'm a little concerned that we have a property that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| understand is vacant, has been vacant, and now we have a use. And Mr. Mullins, I assume your client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5577)|
| 1:33:07| is waiting to get an answer from us before they would invest. If we don't rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5587)|
| 1:33:15| I assume the project doesn't happen. That's correct. You know, we have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5595)|
| 1:33:23| invested a lot in site plan design and tried to be in a position where we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| with our development as quickly as possible following this vote. That's why we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| have an application before the Planning Commission for a special use permit. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| if this zoning doesn't go through, then that application will become moot. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| All right. I think that's all I've got now. I thought of something else, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| maybe Ms. Ryder will ask my question. Council Member Ryder. And then back to Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5631)|
| 1:34:00| You're on mute. You guys can't read my lips by now. Councilman Thomas, you might be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| answer this, and I'm embarrassed, but I can't say, because I was just up there on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| I thought that Mr. Mullins or somebody had stated at the last meeting that the building had already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| been demolished. Is that not true? The building's still standing? I thought it had been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| There was a, and I looked at the site, too. If I'm not mistaken, and you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5661)|
| 1:34:29| Mr. Mullins, but my memory was is that we were sent some material that showed the building's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5669)|
| 1:34:38| still standing. Is that correct, Mr. Mullins? To my understanding, it was still standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| If it's been demolished, I wasn't aware of that. I was out there. Okay. I, like Councilperson Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| I drove by the site, and it looked to me like it was just an empty lot. Can you clarify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| Mr. Mullins? If it has been demolished, I'm not aware of that. That wasn't my client's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| doing. And the last time I was there, when we were looking, when the signs were posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| I thought the building was still there. So if I'm incorrect on that, then I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| Along with Ms. Ryder, I'm quite sure that it's an empty lot right now. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas and Mr. Mullins for clarifying. Ms. Ryder, do you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| more questions at this point? I believe we'll go to Councilmember Robert-Tillinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| Okay. Just real quick, Mr. Mullins, when you say you measure it's 28 feet from the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| you're talking about on a picture? You did that from an image? I did that on KGIS, so it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5737)|
| 1:35:44| exactly correct. I didn't go out there and look for what the building footprint was from KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| using the measurement tools. It was approximately 28 feet. Okay. So all I will say is, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| might have been from the white line or whatever, I would say from where the sidewalk is supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| run, it's, I don't know, maybe not even 10 feet. So here's what I'll say. If the building still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5762)|
| 1:36:11| stands, it's built to the CG2 standards more or less, though it's one story. I mean, not that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| can't be one story, but I'll leave it at that. I think we need to clarify whether the building's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| still there or not, because it seems to be very important about who would be using that lot and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| for what purposes. My observation was that it's an empty lot. I think there used to be penny pawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| on it and I did my GPS and I looked and the only thing I could find there was not where the penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5797)|
| 1:36:46| pawn used to be, but where there's a vacant lot. So we have a cleared lot. So that would take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5806)|
| 1:36:55| any kind of factors about it being a non-conforming use, because there's no building there. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5815)|
| 1:37:05| surprised that the applicant can't clarify that right now about whether or not there's a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| there or not. We'll move on to Councilman Roberto had some questions. Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5832)|
| 1:37:22| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to first start off by saying how much respect I have for my colleague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| Councilmember Thomas, and his advocacy on this point, as well as his comments. And I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| him to know how much I appreciate what he has been saying and the discussion that Council's had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| today. I know that there have been some references to some of the actions that Council previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| took on Kingston Pike. And just wanted to say again that, you know, I very much so appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| what Councilmember Thomas is saying. And a lot of the struggles that he was discussing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| walkability were things that I had considered as well and really thought long and hard about when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| we came to that item on a past agenda in the second district. The most walkable parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| Bearden are Zone CG1. And when I looked at that, and I saw what they were requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5895)|
| 1:38:22| I did not see a conflict of interest in providing a more walkable space. I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5902)|
| 1:38:30| big proponent of a more walkable community and wouldn't want to go in a different direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| than that. And I know that my colleague and I are on the same page on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5916)|
| 1:38:43| So I think thinking about it as those walkable spaces, at least in my decision making when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| came in the second district, was about that walkable space. And I think that I'll be voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5930)|
| 1:39:00| for this as well. I think they are very similar, but I deeply respect my colleague's comments and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| thoughts on this. Thank you. Well, the same to you, Councilman Roberto, but you're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| in all due respect, you're making the same mistake. You're comparing Broadway to Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| And Bearden doesn't have walkability problems as much as almost any other place. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| because it's had an active community that's fought for years to try to get in more walkability. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| even worked on Greenways over there myself. So you're comparing, again, the situation in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| district to the needs in mind on Broadway. And I'm trying to tell you, in all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5980)|
| 1:39:47| they're different needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5987)|
| 1:39:56| Any further questions or comments from Councilmembers? Councilmember Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| I have a question. If nobody can tell us whether the building's there or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| should we vote on this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| I mean, just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| It seems like a salient point to know. But yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| I would entertain a motion to postpone because I think it's definitely a big factor. And here we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6026)|
| 1:40:36| are. And the developer, the applicant, can't even tell us whether there's a building on the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6036)|
| 1:40:45| on the lot that he's asking to rezone. I mean, that's a miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6045)|
| 1:40:53| And in his case, he doesn't own it. So he's trying, but yeah, he doesn't own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| Yeah, I know. But I'm just saying, I imagine he's not, he thought it was still there when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| they made it. And so if it's been torn down since, I do think that is salient for us to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| Vice Mayor McKenzie? Vice Mayor McKenzie, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6071)|

| 1:41:25| postpone. Okay, there's a substitute motion on the floor to postpone until when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6085)|

| 1:45:16| to this investment in North Knoxville. I know there's maybe some questions, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| discussion, questions? Seeing none. Council Member Parker, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6323)|
| 1:45:33| Yes. Could you review those numbers for us? Because this project has begun under different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6333)|
| 1:45:43| city councils, and it would be good to get an update on how far we've moved from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| originally projected numbers. Yeah, absolutely. I'm going to turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| to David Bryce, who's my deputy and overseeing this project on our behalf. Thank you. Go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| David. Yeah, thank you very much, Councilwoman Parker, for the question. And it is a good time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6360)|
| 1:46:08| to look back as this project has spanned both the Rojero administration and now the Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| administration. So the idea of improved public safety facilities has been around a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| It predates my time at the city. And there were investments made at Cement Plant Road for KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| and there were some other investments made for training. But over the last decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| there have been discussions about an improved facility, joint facility for KPD, KFD, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| others. And so Mayor Rojero, the original project started during her term. The original project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6399)|
| 1:46:47| amount was $46.5 million. And then there was a partnership with E911 where they contributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6407)|
| 1:46:56| $3.6 million. So the original project amount was $50.1 million. And so the let me go back as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6416)|
| 1:47:06| when this idea was early in discussions, we hired the city hired a third party to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6426)|
| 1:47:15| and to do a probable cost estimate for the site to analyze it to help us see any potential pitfalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6435)|
| 1:47:22| And so they came in, they looked at the site, they looked at the preliminary programming needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| so the square footage needs for the departments that would be in that facility. And they came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| with a $46.4 million. Again, we had 46.1. And so we were in keeping with our original budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6451)|
| 1:47:40| estimate. And we actually as this project moved forward, both bid packages number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| and bid packages number two, were in keeping with our initial cost estimates. Unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| the major part of this construction, the build out, right, so the first bid package was bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| package one, which was environmental abatement, and the interior demolition of the buildings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6480)|
| 1:48:06| were there. Bid package number two was the mass demolition. So all of the big rubble work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| you've seen, as we have unveiled the historic hospital. So bid package three, now that everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| is the abatements done, all of the heavy demolitions done, the bulk of this project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| building out these existing buildings, each of those floors to meet the needs of court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| pension, fire, police, e 911, and chemo. And so the original number was 50.1. And so this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6507)|
| 1:48:36| based majority, the majority of increases on COVID is now at about $70 million. We will increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6516)|
| 1:48:44| this project by nearly $20 million. In saying that, that's not the news I want to deliver on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| this project. But we do have two ways that we anticipate paying for this. One is bond capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6531)|
| 1:49:00| So the initial bond issuance that you approve was up to $70 million. There's still available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| capacity there. And we also have American Rescue Act. So those dollars, we know the city will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6547)|
| 1:49:14| receiving $44 million from the federal government over the next two fiscal years, specifically for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6554)|
| 1:49:21| things related to COVID. And so that was the original budget. It is out of budget. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| met with many of you, the options are really not great. You know, I was asked by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| who was very concerned about the budget, when I delivered this information, and she said, Hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| what are the options? What's the option to scrap it? scrapping this project impacts a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6578)|
| 1:49:46| number of partnerships, partnership with Lincoln Memorial, a partnership with Fulton, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6586)|
| 1:49:52| the Science Museum and the Clayton Family Foundation's commitment to the site where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| the existing facility is. And so that really wasn't an option. We did discuss the idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6597)|
| 1:50:04| waiting. Could we wait out the market? Could conditions improve? We sat down with the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| Jonathan Gramer, and with the designers and others, and discuss waiting it out. And really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| we're not sure the market in the next 18 to 24 months is going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| And so again, because the Clayton family has a commitment to the museum, waiting it out wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| an option. We have scaled back the project earlier in the project. So things like animal control and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| ICAT, the internet crimes against children, they are staying at Fifth Avenue. So we did reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| that square footage. But we again, moving forward with this project, if it was a simple construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| project for one building, there would be simple answers. I think we could slow down, we could delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| But because of this being an investment in not only North Knoxville and Oakland-Lincoln Park and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| Old North, it's an investment with these partnerships. And so that's the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| Councilwoman Parker, and I'll hush and see if there's any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6660)|
| 1:51:09| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Brace, in the original discussion we had about this contract back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6671)|
| 1:51:19| with the former Council when this began, there was a lot of discussion about a contractor at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| model that the Council was very interested in making sure was a part of the contract. I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6687)|
| 1:51:36| you and I certainly having a lot of discussions about the first bid because I had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6696)|
| 1:51:43| concerns about the environmental abatement and whether or not we might have some asbestos that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| we might not know about and having that increase the budget. So it was certainly a very, it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| very, the Council was very interested in that model. Can you talk to us about that model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6713)|
| 1:52:02| we had with the contractor at risk and why we're in this position now with you coming back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6722)|
| 1:52:10| Yeah, thank you very much, Councilman Roberto. And I do specifically remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| members of Council, you also remember Councilman Wallace being very concerned. At the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| there was a lot of dialogue about the unknowns, a complicated site, a former hospital site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| You know, we had two of those in Knoxville. One was Baptist that took nearly a decade on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| the waterfront to be redeveloped. And hospital sites are notoriously challenging with environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| abatement and unknowns. And so at the time, the answer that I gave, and I'm glad I provided one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| disclaimer in that answer was the CM at risk model, which is where you bring the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6762)|
| 1:52:49| and you bring the designer and the city together. So you're designing and you're estimating at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| same time that keep yourself in budget. And so that worked for bids one and two early. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| challenge has been with COVID and the increase in the, the drastic increase in the cost per square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| foot. And so the CM at risk at each phase, you work with the contractor to develop what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| a guaranteed maximum price. And so we were able to do that on bid package one, environmental abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| and interior demo. We were able to do that on bid package number two, on the mass demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6802)|
| 1:53:29| When it came to bid package three, we could not find and agree upon a guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| And so we decided that at that time with consultation with our owners representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| Volkert Engineering, that we would not go forward with that model and we would take it to hard bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6819)|
| 1:53:45| to the market. Let's see if other contractors in addition to Messer could compete. And we did a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| hard bid and the numbers continued to go up. So at that point, we said, stop, the numbers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| are just drastically beyond what we had anticipated. And so we're ready to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| with this contract so that we don't have any additional cost increases. And so I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| that that model did work. I would say that the answer I gave at the time was that barring a global| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6845)|
| 1:54:12| incident, I'm not sure what the exact language was. I think I gave an example of a war in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| Middle East. We should stay in budget on this. And so the original buildout estimates per square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6857)|
| 1:54:26| foot that were done by Benefield Rectors. So these are the fours, not new construction, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| fours that will be built out. They were at $150 a square foot. And about in October, they moved up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| to about 195. And the most recent bid was at 230 a square foot. And so we've gone from that 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| for buildout up to 230. And again, I'm not happy to bring this before Council. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6884)|
| 1:54:52| obviously, I have carried this project forward with other partners. The reality is, we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| American Rescue Act dollars to help with this. We're waiting on Treasury to give us guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| and we do have bond capacity. But we are far enough long in this project that there aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| great options. We've got so many partnerships, commitments, backing away from it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| incredibly difficult. Well, so the guaranteed maximum price language that's in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6911)|
| 1:55:26| gave us protection in bid one, bid two, doesn't give us protection in bid three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6926)|
| 1:55:32| Is the reason it doesn't give us protection in bid three is because of the pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| Well, the guaranteed maximum price is developed on each phase of the project. And so as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| guaranteed maximum price is developed, the owner, the contractor, the designer all come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| and the owner's rep to flesh out that price. And unfortunately, with COVID, those numbers were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| beyond what we could afford. So we went back out to the market, hoping that we could drive down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| those costs. And it hasn't happened. The market is incredibly volatile right now on the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| end. And if anyone has gone and, you know, gone and seen the prices of two by fours or plywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| or OSB, it's just in a very unique state. So COVID, things shut down, there were supply chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| interruptions. There was also a lot of capital in the market. So people are doing capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| renovations. And so it was nothing we could have predicted back when we did the original estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6985)|
| 1:56:33| on this project. If we were still up $150 a square foot, we would be in budget and be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| But we're in unique times. And we're far enough along with this project that the commitments we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| made are really important. I think I outlined those the people, the folks that I was able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| meet with that had reached out in the email that I sent to you about those commitments with LMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| You know, LMU, I talked with Mr. Debusque, you know, they'd originally planned on investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7016)|
| 1:57:00| 5 million in the tower building. They've doubled that to 10, and they're not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| And so costs are up. And those commitments are in place with Fulton and with LMU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7026)|
| 1:57:14| Science Museum, you know, moving forward is the option we're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| Is the same reason for the issue with not being able to, you know, the cost increase that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7040)|
| 1:57:31| seeing and not being protected by that measure we had looked at previously with the other two bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7051)|
| 1:57:40| is that same reason making it applicable for the American Rescue Act money to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7060)|
| 1:57:51| help with this project? So the initial guidance that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| been provided by Treasury is that those dollars are designed for a number of things, but specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| impacts related to COVID. So that could be things like lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| So a good example of that would be the hotel-motel tax. There was a window where hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| and motels were vacant, and the anticipated tax revenue from that did not come in as anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| So that would be a good example. Or overages or costs associated with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| So we're waiting on Treasury to bring us the guidance we need to then determine how much do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| we add in bond capacity, how much do we use out of the American Rescue Act funds that we know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7109)|
| 1:58:36| will be getting. And that will take, again, a few, it's going to take anywhere from 8 to 12 weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| maybe longer to figure that out. And so, but even as those monies are deposited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| and I believe that will happen around May, there will still be guidance coming from Treasury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| So as I put into the AIS, and I've communicated with a number of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| this bid is only good for 60 days from the date of the bid. And so we don't want to lose what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| locked in now. So we want to proceed forward, and we have cash flow to start this project, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| It won't end until August of 2022, which is later than we had originally anticipated. So we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| to need an additional six months for Mr. Clayton to stay on the site that we are at now. And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| talked with him, and he is open to that. And so we will bring back to Council the plan for how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7163)|
| 1:59:30| will finance the remaining balance of this project. We will bring that back again here in a few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| maybe a couple of months. It just depends on when we get information from Treasury. And we will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| back and say, here's the percentage we're going to take from American Rescue Act. Here's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| going to do with debt capacity and the bonds. Can you review for us, and you've kind of referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7187)|
| 1:59:54| it a little bit in our discussion this evening, can you talk to us about where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7194)|
| 2:00:02| or where the city is right now in this investment? And can you tie into that the different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| you know, partners like LMU and others that I know you've identified in your message to Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| but I think it might be very important for the public to hear that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| Yeah, and what I'm going to do is review partners, and I'm going to ask Jonathan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| Grammer. I should have said this on the front end. So this resolution is a contract with Messer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| Construction. They've been the CM at risk, the contractor on this project. And so John Bloom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7229)|
| 2:00:36| an executive with Messer, he's on this call. I also have on this call Jonathan Grammer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7236)|
| 2:00:43| who's with Volkert Engineering. He wakes up every day thinking about this project. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| going to ask Jonathan to provide the answer of what have we spent to date out of the $50.1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| and I'm going to review partners where Jonathan gets that number for you. And those are dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| that we've spent, again, on bid package one and two, and we're just now wrapping up bid package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7257)|
| 2:01:02| two. There's some things we've got to finish. But when you look at the partnerships, some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| we knew about, right, early on. We knew that Lincoln Memorial had an interest in the tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| and investing in higher education right here on the campus. And so that was a key early partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| So LMU and their organization, they have invested over $10 million in the historic Magdalene Clark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7279)|
| 2:01:28| Tower building. That building now houses about 160 nurses and nursing staff and professors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7288)|
| 2:01:35| Over the next two to three years, they will be adding law classrooms. They need more law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| school classrooms. They'll be adding a dental school, a dentistry school. The nearest school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| for dentistry is in Memphis. So that school will be here in Knoxville, and they're adding an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| optometry program. And so there will be over 600 people in that building when those investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7311)|
| 2:01:59| are made. So that is a really important investment. LMU has also recently purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| the Spine Center building, which is right across the street from the Magdalene Clark Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| and they will be using that as a community dentistry and optometry school. So they will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| excuse me, not school, but clinic. So they're partnering with RAM, and they're partnering with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| a group out of Virginia that will have 70 chairs for dentistry services for people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| uninsured or underinsured, and for people that need eye care, so that the students will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| to walk across the street from their classrooms and provide that care to the community. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7351)|
| 2:02:35| a really key partnership. KCDC is handling the redevelopment for the north portions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7355)|
| 2:02:42| campus. And so the north campus at St. Mary's is everything from the historic hospital north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7362)|
| 2:02:49| towards Sharps Ridge. KCDC is in the process of evaluating the north campus for private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| That initial work shows a mix of housing, from housing and or senior housing, something in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| historic hospital, which is challenging to say, to higher density housing, all the way down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| duplexes and single family. And so I believe that KCDC, Ben Bentley is also on this call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| and I provided an update on that project. So that's a key partner. We also have a partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| with obviously the Clayton Family Foundation, although not directly linked early, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| now linked because that land has transferred to the Clayton Family Foundation. We're actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| dollar a year lease on that land where the safety center is. So Clayton, I talked with Mr. Clayton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| he's still committed. They slowed down a bit because of COVID. They did that very intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| because we're not sure, he's not sure what the history of museums will be post-COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| And so they are now re-engaging with designers and they are working on the design of that museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| So I consider them a partner. Fulton High School is also an incredible partner, right? We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| students and career tracked into nursing and into emergency services, dispatching, fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7437)|
| 2:04:05| And so I'm not sure if this is public yet, Mayor Ginkanen, but Fulton is committed to and will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| hiring a staff member to develop this career track program. And so that is an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7452)|
| 2:04:19| commitment to Fulton. I would also just say having an active space adjacent to a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| important high school in our community, just having that investment, even if we didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| the career track. We also have a relationship with E911. So Executive Director Brad Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7468)|
| 2:04:36| former KPD officer, now the Executive Director of E911. There is a very antiquated backup 9-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| center in the current KPD building. And so Brad has found capital dollars. So part of the $50.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7483)|
| 2:04:50| million is $3.6 million for a backup 9-1-1 center for our community. So that if the 9-1-1 center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| goes down, we actually have a backup facility. It will also include training rooms and offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7497)|
| 2:05:04| for the Emergency Management Agency. So that's another partnership that we've been involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| And then a very, very early partnership that Mayor Ginkanen and Mayor Jacobs have discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| is the former surgery building on the corner of St. Mary's and Woodland. And there is a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7514)|
| 2:05:21| there. We own the ground. There was a long-term lease to a real estate investment group out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| Chicago. They want to sell the building. It's in great condition. So we've had preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| dialogue about acquiring that building to build out an acute medical facility for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7530)|
| 2:05:38| but also a behavioral health and addiction services partnership. So people could go there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| be medically cleared. Imagine an ambulance that picks up someone who's having a mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| crisis. They could be, if they're not emergency, right, they go and they get medically cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| If they need an emergency room and they're not medically cleared, they would be transported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| to the ER. But for individuals that really just need behavioral health care in crises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| they would be medically cleared by the acute care staff and then be handed off to a third-party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| provider like Helen Ross McNabb. So all of those partnerships, again, if we were back in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7566)|
| 2:06:13| it would be easier to walk away from this, but these partnerships are all in play right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| and are pretty exciting. So I know you had another question. I'm going to turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| to Jonathan Gramer so he can talk about what we have spent today. What do we have in the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7582)|
| 2:06:30| Thank you, David. The construction on bid packs one and two and the professional services that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7590)|
| 2:06:37| we have spent today equal about $15 million. One thing I would say on bid packs one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7597)|
| 2:06:44| those pricing exercises were done and the GMPs were established in January of 2020 for bid pack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7604)|
| 2:06:53| number one and then in April of 2020 for bid pack number two. Those were done, obviously, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7613)|
| 2:07:00| you know, prior to the pandemic, one, as it was just starting. But both of those, as David mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| are demo only, very little material in those. And early on in the pandemic, pricing did not start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7625)|
| 2:07:15| to increase initially. It was later in the year when those price increases began to happen. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| I just want to give you those dates of when those first two GMPs were established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| And when it came time to establish the third GMP, which was the big one for all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| renovation work, it was well after the pandemic had taken hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7651)|
| 2:07:39| Okay. Thank you. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7659)|
| 2:07:46| Did other council members have questions or comments? Council Member Parker and then Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7666)|
| 2:07:55| Um, I am, um, I'm concerned about these numbers for multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7675)|
| 2:08:06| I'm concerned that we are just now learning about increased cost attached to projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7686)|
| 2:08:14| when we're in the midst of discussing other major projects to move forward with numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| that were shared with us before the pandemic and have not been updated. Obviously, the sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| stadium is top of mind. If there's a 50% increase in costs associated with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7707)|
| 2:08:36| I think in considering this project, we have to ask questions about how it might impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7716)|
| 2:08:46| um, future capital projects. I'm concerned about discussion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7726)|
| 2:08:55| the American recovery plan being used towards this project. My understanding of it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7735)|
| 2:09:03| that's not the true intention behind it. And if we're just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| uh, use it to supplement projects we already had in the works, um, we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7748)|
| 2:09:17| capitalizing on that funding. So then we ensure it reaches those most in need in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7757)|
| 2:09:25| who's had the most economic impact in our community. As we know, the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7765)|
| 2:09:32| uh, community has been doing very, very well throughout the pandemic. And I'm not sure that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| the best place to put our dollars, especially towards projects we've already been committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| It's not new projects. Um, is that a question that can be answered or do we not know until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7782)|
| 2:09:50| know more about the American recovery plan? What, how will this impact future capital projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7790)|
| 2:09:58| So we obviously, sorry, Mayor, I'm sorry. No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| Yeah, I think we, we budget on a yearly basis. So every year we evaluate capital projects. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| we do not anticipate this overage impacting next year's capital budgets. But we do not have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7810)|
| 2:10:17| guidance yet, um, on the American Rescue Act. If we needed to fully bond the balance of this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| use a rescue act, uh, there's, there's a way to do that. And we have, again, capital bonds right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| now are very cheap. They're 1.89%. We've got incredible bond ratings. And we, if we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7830)|
| 2:10:38| do that, we will. But I think right now it would be premature to try to say how we will package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| this from a financing perspective. Um, I do think that much of the intention of the American Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7844)|
| 2:10:51| Act is to address COVID specific items. It can be losses, overages, et cetera. But we will wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| on Treasury to provide that final guidance to us over the coming weeks. And we will be bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| back the strategy once we, uh, once we determine that, uh, the best strategy once Treasury provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| guidelines. Yeah, that's what I was going to just say is that, uh, when these federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7870)|
| 2:11:17| come to us, we'll need to examine what the guidance is, what the allowable expenditures are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| and then format a best strategy for how to apply those dollars to the best interest of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7884)|
| 2:11:30| of the city. And I'll bring it back to Council for your review and approval. That's, uh, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| something that will happen. But we don't have enough information yet to know what that strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| can look like because we don't have the guidance. The, uh, the final point I wanted to make is I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7898)|
| 2:11:45| not clear on why a postponement would not be warranted in this situation. I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| there are partnerships in place, uh, that might make us want to continue to move forward, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| don't understand why a postponement wouldn't be possible, especially when LMU is committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| and LMU, a private institution, uh, who has the funding to make these investments is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7925)|
| 2:12:12| has already made plans to move forward with current development. And so we know development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| will be happening, uh, at this location. Um, you know, KCDC is very welcome to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| with looking into the private development. Of course, those are public dollars, so I would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| that work to pause as well so that we're not paying 50% more than we would have to for projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7952)|
| 2:12:39| that, you know, will be just as beneficial to our community, uh, two years down the road as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7959)|
| 2:12:46| would be if they were finished, you know, sooner. Yeah, and Councilwoman Parker, uh, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| couple of questions in there that I'll try to answer. One, I would not, um, so the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| investment that, um, that Mr. Debusque has made and LMU have made in that tower, I'm not sure if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7978)|
| 2:13:04| we walked away if they would continue with the additional investments in that building. They,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| they are there because they want to be close to a big public sector investment. I would also say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| that the KCDC efforts, that is city property where KCDC is doing their planning. We've asked them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| do it on our behalf. We would not anticipate, uh, city dollars going into that north campus. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8000)|
| 2:13:27| what we are saying is there will be a study done with public input, and then KCDC will take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| property to the market for an RFP, and the market would invest in that. So, I don't think there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| be significant city dollars, any city dollars beyond the value of the land, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| there's a value of the land, and then there's a large historic hospital that has lots of costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| for it. And so, and the delay, uh, is very concerning. This bid, uh, does not have a life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| uh, that just continues on and on. Again, Mr. Bloom, the folks at Messer, the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| market is volatile. Uh, that bid happened in March. It has a 60-day life, and then we're back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| to the drawing board. And so, uh, and then I would also remind you that we have a commitment to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| Clayton. We have a lease that says we would be off in two years. I've already discussed with him a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| six-month extension, an amendment to that lease, so that we could stay where we're at. Um, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| domino effect of delaying, uh, to me is very concerning. So, I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| Can you tell me when that lease, uh, what's the start date of that lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| I cannot get that to you this second, but I know that we're going to need an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| six months. I will email it to everyone on council tomorrow. I will pull the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8078)|
| 2:14:44| I will say I get a lot of questions about the museum, and the public is very interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8084)|
| 2:14:50| updates, uh, on that project. Yeah, and, and I, I will reach out. I've talked with, uh, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| uh, uh, the mayor had a good meeting with Mr. Clayton. It's been a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| just a check-in meeting. Uh, Mr. Clayton, uh, did pause during COVID, specifically because of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| uh, you know, how will museums innovate in the future? You know, before COVID, uh, museums were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| all about touching things and putting on, uh, goggles, and, and so he wanted to wait a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8113)|
| 2:15:20| until he was vaccinated, number one, and then, two, wanted to wait a bit to see how the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| field was going to address post-world pandemic museum spaces. So, uh, I talked to him last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8124)|
| 2:15:33| and he, uh, he's planning a trip to New York, uh, with his team and was on another call with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| a designer from New York, and so, uh, that's moving forward, but I do, I, I don't mind. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8138)|
| 2:15:44| love to get an update, uh, from him about where he's at and try to get that to you, and, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| obviously, you can relay that. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8148)|
| 2:15:57| Um, I just was gonna echo the concern that I think LMU's continued investment and their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8157)|
| 2:16:05| are continued, are contingent upon us developing that site and not leaving them in a lurch there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8165)|
| 2:16:13| Um, I think, you know, I'll let Councilman Thomas speak to that, but from the other side of Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| I know our neighborhoods, um, this, you know, the hospital leaving was a huge blow to us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8178)|
| 2:16:25| left us with the huge unknown of what was going to happen, and I don't think any of us could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| foreseen, um, I think as Mr. Brace mentioned, a war in the Middle East seemed far more likely than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8189)|
| 2:16:36| the pandemic that we've currently been going through, and, uh, lumber and steel have all gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| up exponentially, um, and I think that's going to impact projects down the road. I will say in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8202)|
| 2:16:49| recent tour and visit with, uh, Fulton High School, um, because my child's an upcoming ninth grader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8209)|
| 2:16:57| Mr. Smith, the principal there in the school, they're very excited about the partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| Um, this is game-changing for that school there, so, um, you know, that's important. That's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8221)|
| 2:17:08| really important role we're playing, and that's a win-win. It's definitely eliminated the lemons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| of us losing that healthcare option there, so I'm not really excited about the increased costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8233)|
| 2:17:20| I'm excited that we have a 60-day, um, commitment, and I know that time is ticking on that. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| some contractors are giving people, when they give quotes, it's good for five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| so, um, at this point, if you're looking for quotes in your home project, so the market is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| incredibly volatile right now with that. Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8256)|
| 2:17:43| Any other questions or comments from Council? Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8263)|
| 2:17:49| Thank you. Um, Mr. Brace, if you wouldn't mind just breaking it down real simple for me. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| did we estimate it at, and how much more do we need to, uh, fund this that we did not anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8274)|
| 2:18:02| I'll do very, very simple here. The original project with 9-1-1 was $50.1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8282)|
| 2:18:09| so $50 million, $50.1. We need an additional, uh, $19,992 and $850. $19,992, $850. I have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8289)|
| 2:18:23| with E-9-1-1. There is a proportional increase for 9-1-1 space. I've talked with Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| Director Brad Andrews. He has already communicated the need for 9-1-1 to increase their proportional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| amount, so he will hear that before his, uh, mayors on the E-9-1-1 board. I would anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8314)|
| 2:18:42| he anticipates 9-1-1 shipping in an additional $647,252.85 for their space, so that will lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8322)|
| 2:18:52| the city's total commitment overage to $19,345,598. So, uh, $19,345,598, assuming that E-9-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8332)|
| 2:19:04| makes their commitment for the increases in their square footage costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| So, a little more than $19 million. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8352)|
| 2:19:19| Vice Mayor, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| I did. And so, um, you know, I, like everyone else, you know, was new on council when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| conversation, uh, was going on initially and had concerns about, you know, uh, I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| was Council Member Roberto who stated, you know, would, um, would there be some things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| would encounter along the way that could potentially increase the cost of this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| Um, I don't think any of us back then could have imagined that it would have been a global| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| pandemic that could have some implications and impact to, um, material, like, material cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| specifically. And so, um, while, you know, I'm not happy about it, I don't think any of us are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8396)|
| 2:20:03| but I do see, uh, the need to continue to move forward with the project because if we do look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| at delaying, there is no guarantee that prices will go down, uh, more than likely with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| market that will continue to go up. So, uh, with that said, I will be supporting, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8414)|
| 2:20:21| to look forward with this today. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| Thank you, Vice Mayor. And as, as you stated, uh, when I first heard about this overage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8425)|
| 2:20:33| it was a real sucker punch. You know, it's a lot of, uh, a lot of unexpected expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| And so, I did carefully evaluate the other options. Was it going to make more sense to walk away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| Was it going to make more sense to delay? And we, we considered those options, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8445)|
| 2:20:51| the least bad option. It's not an awesome option, but it's the least bad option for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| for our partnerships, for our commitment to, uh, avoiding blight in the not, in the absence of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| hospital. Um, so, I appreciate that this is not anything anybody would prefer to do, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8463)|
| 2:21:10| sometimes, uh, you have to move forward with the least bad option. Uh, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| Yes, Mayor, you actually said, um, some of the things that I was going to underline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| As you know, Mayor, you and I met, uh, and I met with, uh, Brace, uh, Mr. Brace, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8482)|
| 2:21:30| talked about what are our options now. And I lament, like everyone else, this unforeseen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8490)|
| 2:21:37| uh, cost overrun. A lot of it has to do with COVID. Um, but if we look at what our options are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8497)|
| 2:21:45| this one, unfortunately, just seems the best one. There's really not any other good options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| I don't think, than, than just to go forward. And, um, a lot of the, um, ancillary development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8512)|
| 2:22:00| that would come from this project, I think would, would be a big benefit, and it probably won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| happen, uh, if we scrap the project. And, um, Mr. Brace alluded to a few things when we went, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| Mr. Brace, we looked at the, um, the buildings close by that the dental school could possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8532)|
| 2:22:19| use. Uh, we looked at another, uh, building on the corner of, um, I think it was St. Mary's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8539)|
| 2:22:25| Woodland that could be used for medical facilities. So, um, this is bigger, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8545)|
| 2:22:33| the investment here will actually spur, um, investment in the area, which is, is much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| needed. It's, you know, like everyone else, I lament that this cost overrun is happening. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| but, um, if we look at all the options, I think it's, it's fairly clear by far our best options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8566)|
| 2:22:53| is just to go ahead. Thank you, Council Member Thomas. And look for other ways to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| fund it as well, uh, as Mr. Brace has talked about some of the possibilities. So I'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| I will be supporting it. Thank you. So, uh, Council Member Singh. Thank you. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8586)|
| 2:23:14| I guess my concern was putting good money after bad. And it sounds like we are at a place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8594)|
| 2:23:25| we have to finish this. Um, I've never voted in favor of the money going for the public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8605)|
| 2:23:32| center. Uh, but at this point, it's changing to a lot of community involvement, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8612)|
| 2:23:40| I'm going to vote in favor because I think we're at a point if we pull out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| we start all over again, then it's more costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| Thank you, Council Member Singh. Any other questions or comments? Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| Just wanted to lift up that, uh, it seems the discussion is focused on pulling out rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| postponing or delaying. Uh, and I still see no concerns with delaying the project. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| that does not abandon LMU. It does not abandon any of our partners. Uh, it just does our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8648)|
| 2:24:15| due diligence and ensures that we are the best stewards of our public dollars. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| private entities just have to, uh, make sure that their bottom line still works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| Public entities, we have to be much, much, much greater stewards of the public dollar. So for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8667)|
| 2:24:35| um, you know, I think, uh, we've got a good deal right now with our dollar lease payment with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8675)|
| 2:24:43| KPD site, and it seems like that project has slowed down, uh, because of the pandemic. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8683)|
| 2:24:50| we also can slow down on our end. Um, so I still see no arguments being made for slowing down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8690)|
| 2:24:58| project, for not slowing down the project. Um, it seems like folks just want to do the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| and if it costs 20 million more, oh, well. Thank you, Council Member Parker. Council Member Fugitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8704)|
| 2:25:11| Thank you. I want to speak to Councilwoman Parker's comments about slowing down. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| think there's a problem with slowing down. If we slow down, the prices are only going to probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| continue to increase. Most of the time, prices don't go down the longer you wait, and I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8721)|
| 2:25:28| there is a ripple effect to our delay with the other projects that are being talked about. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8728)|
| 2:25:36| we can agree to disagree on that, but that's why I'll be voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| Thank you, Council Member Fugitt. Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| Are the price increases not due to the demand for lumber in the market at the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8745)|
| 2:25:54| That is one of the reasons. That is one of the reasons. But typically, prices tend to rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8754)|
| 2:26:01| unless demand falls, and we already have a greater demand than there is supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8761)|
| 2:26:11| Well, one thing that we've been told is that we had a shift in our economy during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8771)|
| 2:26:18| where folks were before eating out, going to establishments. Now everyone's staying home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| doing home improvement projects. So I can imagine as things start to open up, people are no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8784)|
| 2:26:30| focused on home improvement projects. The market can shift, and those lumber prices could go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| I'm just making the argument that there could be a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| Yes, ma'am. And we will just agree to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| So I think I'll be on the end of agreeing to disagree because I don't have a crystal ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| that it's not going to go up more. The prices went up because there were multiple hurricanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| in addition to the pandemic, supply chain, people doing home improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8820)|
| 2:27:07| There was the pandemic. Then there was something stuck in the Suez Canal. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| there's just been one thing after another. And the hurricanes aren't going to stop. And every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| time a hurricane hits, the light front lumber prices go up. So for everyone I know in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| construction industry, there's no end in sight. There's certainly a straw that's going to break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| the camel's back. I'm a little concerned about us getting stuck in a position where it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8846)|
| 2:27:32| even more than what we're talking about right now. So I think we just suck it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8852)|
| 2:27:38| And I also have toured the facility that we're using right now as the safety center. It is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| just a matter of a dollar lease for that building. It's literally collapsing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8863)|
| 2:27:50| our staff members that work there, including our court system. If you go into certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8870)|
| 2:27:56| of the building, it's literally spalding and collapsing and falling off. So that is the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| that while I've been on council longer than some, we approved this expense in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8882)|
| 2:28:10| One of the reasons. Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| So no further questions or discussion. Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8895)|
| 2:28:21| Councilman Thomas. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8901)|

| 2:28:48| Councilmember Sandoval. Question carries 8-1. Thank you, Councilmembers for your support. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| like to call recess until 840. Reconvene at 840. All right, everybody. It's 841. Thanks for coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8933)|
| 2:29:03| back. I always wonder if we all will, but here we are. Next item, Mr. Johnson, please read our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8943)|
| 2:29:12| item. 11B is a resolution approving the extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8952)|
| 2:29:16| of the City of Knoxville fiscal year ending 2021 for a total contract price of $169,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8956)|
| 2:29:28| Moved to approve. Motion made to approve by Councilmember Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| seconded by Vice Mayor McKenzie. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8971)|
| 2:29:38| Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote. Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8978)|
| 2:29:42| Yes. Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| Yes. Councilman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| Yes. Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8989)|

| 2:29:55| Yes. Councilman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| Yes. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| Yes. And Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| Yes. Motion carries 9-0. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9003)|
| 2:30:08| 11C is a resolution respectfully requesting the administration to allocate $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9008)|
| 2:30:13| in the fiscal year 2021-2022 budget to reduce and prevent crime as well as fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9013)|
| 2:30:19| interventional programming. Moved to approve but with a substitute resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9019)|
| 2:30:28| I believe the one you read, Will, is the non-amended one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| So a motion on the floor to offer a substitute resolution. Is there a second to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9033)|
| 2:30:42| I'll second. I think it was sent to Council this afternoon. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| Okay. So the substitute motion has been offered for a different resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| and Councilmembers received a copy of that earlier this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9051)|
| 2:30:58| Do we want to show that on the screen? I don't know if that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| I think that'd be a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| Yeah, that's a good idea. And then Councilmember Singh, you have the floor to explain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9063)|
| 2:31:10| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| Thank you. I want to apologize for everything being so last minute, but we had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9071)|
| 2:31:17| conversations and I was working hard with administration trying to bring something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9077)|
| 2:31:24| forward that would make administration comfortable and help my fellow Councilmembers vote in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9084)|
| 2:31:34| favor of this, to feel comfortable with it. One of the things that has been removed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9094)|
| 2:31:42| a number, the $4 million number to pay for these programs, which I don't care for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9102)|
| 2:31:51| but I also have learned a great deal doing, working on this resolution. One is I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9111)|
| 2:31:58| making a request to change the budget beforehand would make it possible for Councilmember to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9118)|
| 2:32:03| that, and it is not possible. So what is good about this resolution is I think the meat of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9123)|
| 2:32:11| is still here, which is I think we need to get a plan together with all kinds of members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9131)|
| 2:32:19| the community at the same table to have a strategy to address more than what Cities United is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9139)|
| 2:32:28| addressing. I respect what Cities United is responding to. Their mission statement is gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9148)|
| 2:32:36| violence to reduce gun violence in Black young men and boys. I think the million-dollar resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9156)|
| 2:32:45| that we have put into that should be able to cover, or we need enough funding to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| cover that mission, and there are many more incidences of violence, potential violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9171)|
| 2:32:58| and intervening with situations before they become violent and into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9178)|
| 2:33:06| Um, yeah, so I just, this has the substance that I wanted, and in here is also that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9186)|
| 2:33:17| there are dollars from the rescue plan, which I think that there are, to pay for some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| project. I'm looking forward to that being $4 million, but that is not in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9208)|
| 2:33:36| Council Member Singh, I just want to first thank you for your long-standing commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9216)|
| 2:33:44| for violence interruption and just to stopping violence in general. I know you've been committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| to this on council, but also this is your passion and your work and your professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| life outside of council as well, so I appreciate that and share that passion in my role as mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9232)|
| 2:34:00| as well. So, violence interruption and other ways of interrupting violence that's acute and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9240)|
| 2:34:09| potentially fatal and other kinds of violence that is less fatal but still damaging and traumatizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| those are acute and critical issues that we need to face as a community, and I really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9255)|
| 2:34:23| your collaborative spirit in offering this proposed resolution, the substitute amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9263)|
| 2:34:30| resolution. It showcases our shared sense of urgency and the importance of engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9270)|
| 2:34:37| our many partners outside the city, because as you well know, many of the things that can best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9277)|
| 2:34:44| help reduce violence and promote healing in our community are things outside the city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9284)|
| 2:34:50| in the private sector, but also in our partners that deal in mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| and criminal justice systems. So, thank you for your collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9294)|
| 2:34:59| Questions and comments from Vice Mayor McKenzie? Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9299)|
| 2:35:05| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Singh, for submitting and bringing forth this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9305)|
| 2:35:12| resolution. This is an issue that continues to increasingly rear its head in our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9312)|
| 2:35:22| in our city, and definitely needs attention. We know that there are several grassroots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9322)|
| 2:35:30| organizations that are doing some really, really good work and, for various reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9330)|
| 2:35:36| are not able to get sufficient funding to just be able to do some of the basic things that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9336)|
| 2:35:43| I see it firsthand with people who have a heart and a passion for this work, and they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| steadily come out of their pocket to do this work, to help support the work, but need the help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9348)|
| 2:35:56| absolutely need the help. And so, I don't know if Director Lomax is on the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9356)|
| 2:36:04| but I'd like to maybe hear a little bit about his thoughts on how we're going to engage with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| these organizations and get them to the table, and maybe look and talk about capacity building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9369)|
| 2:36:17| and how we can help support them, and some of, maybe, the creative ways that that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9377)|
| 2:36:22| So, I don't know if Charles Lomax is on. Yes, Dr. Charles Lomax, Director of Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| Empowerment, is familiar with our efforts and partnerships with some of these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9387)|
| 2:36:33| big and small, and I'd love to, if you could share a little bit about our work with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9393)|
| 2:36:38| and going forward. Absolutely. Good evening, Mayor Kincannon, Members of Council. Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| Lomax, Director of Community Empowerment, 400 Main Street. In our efforts to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9404)|
| 2:36:53| various organizations, and as we look to commit resources, financial and otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9413)|
| 2:37:01| to various organizations, we partner with a number of different groups throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| many of which have come before you all, where we've been requesting funding for a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| different initiatives that these programs have been involved in. And we're grateful for Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9432)|
| 2:37:19| as you all have always done what has been needed to do when we've made those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9439)|
| 2:37:26| We do have a limited resources or limited resource of funding. We have $100,000 that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9446)|
| 2:37:32| utilize throughout the fiscal year that go towards funding various components of a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9452)|
| 2:37:39| different programs, most of which are youth-oriented or are geared towards our young people. 90 to 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9459)|
| 2:37:48| percent of these are enrichment-based as opposed to violence-based, and we continue to do that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| as requests are made to us. And part of the goal with the funding program that we have through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9474)|
| 2:38:00| empowerment grants are to help those organizations that are grassroots or that are fairly new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9480)|
| 2:38:06| that are in the trenches, that are doing the work, that oftentimes aren't able to qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9486)|
| 2:38:12| for a community agency grant. And so we don't have the same stipulations that a community agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| grant does in that the organization doesn't have to be in existence with its 501c3 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9497)|
| 2:38:24| at least five years. And with our grants, you can apply at any point throughout the year as long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| the funding is there, and it kind of outlines and meets the criteria that we are looking for with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9510)|
| 2:38:36| those fundings. And so we continue to work with that. But in addition to just the funding aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9516)|
| 2:38:42| one of the main things that we try to promote is collaboration from across different sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| and we're able to do that through our mayor's roundtable of youth-serving organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9528)|
| 2:38:55| And so we have a number of different organizations, big and small, that are part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| roundtable, and we push partnership, we push collaboration, because oftentimes we find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9539)|
| 2:39:05| a lot of people are trying to do the same thing or the same work, but they're working in silos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| and we try to bring them together in order to do that. And if you look on the website for Empower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9550)|
| 2:39:16| Knox on the city's website, you'll see a number of those organizations that are part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| roundtable. And we've been fortunate enough that our numbers have begun to grow, and so because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| the roundtable became a little larger than we anticipated or expected, we've actually broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9567)|
| 2:39:33| the roundtable up into subcommittees, and we've been focusing on four different aspects, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9573)|
| 2:39:41| education, workforce development, mental health and trauma, and civic engagement. And so these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| the four areas in which our roundtable partners are working, and then we collaboratively come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| together as well to discuss the greater needs of the city. And we're grateful to have an amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9594)|
| 2:40:00| staff that helps to occupy that, including Kathy Mack, Tasha Harris, and then LaKenya Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| has also been a part of that work as well. And so we continue to work with some of our smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9606)|
| 2:40:12| grassroots organizations, again, as well as those that are larger, but we are, again, trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| help them to get to the point where they are sustainable and where they're able to qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9618)|
| 2:40:25| for a community agency grant or other grants that may be out there that can help their program to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| function. Thank you, Director Lomax. Very quickly, I know that there were some organizations, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9631)|
| 2:40:40| trying to find a list on the website now, maybe you can help me with that, but I know that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9640)|
| 2:40:46| were several organizations that may or may not have been on the list. I think some of them with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| the frustration was that they have not had a seat at the table and they've not been afforded the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| opportunity to maybe have the conversation. And so, you know, I'd like to work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| guys or maybe suggest that, you know, there is some type of series where you have conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| whether it's a Facebook Live event or something, and maybe interview some of these organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9668)|
| 2:41:14| and talk to them about what they're doing. Because one thing that I will say is the outpouring of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| people and love across the city who want to help, who want to help with their time and talent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| resources, and just sometimes it's the same organizations that they hear about and the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| that are more grassroots, boots on the ground, they don't get as much notoriety, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9691)|
| 2:41:38| or publicity about what they're doing. And so, if that's something that maybe you would consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| I'd like to work with you on that so we can counsel on the same, to just make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| they have a voice and that we're doing what we can to help elevate them once you guys have met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| with them, to help them get the exposure across the city about the work that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9713)|
| 2:42:00| Absolutely. Our roundtable is definitely open for anyone and everyone that, again, is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9720)|
| 2:42:06| in that vein of work. And we are definitely excited about the potential to partner with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9726)|
| 2:42:13| and for them to assist us and us to assist them. And so, we welcome that and would love to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9733)|
| 2:42:21| anybody to the table. And we meet on a monthly basis, actually, and sometimes even more frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9741)|
| 2:42:29| depending on the subcommittee group. And so, we would gladly welcome new additions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie and Dr. Lomax. Council Member Parker. There is one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9756)|
| 2:42:44| signed up to speak to this. Mr. Johnson, let us know if that person's on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| Council Member Parker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| Thank you. And thank you, Councilwoman Singh, for bringing this resolution forward. I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9773)|
| 2:43:00| disappointed to see how much it's had to be edited down. And it obviously shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9780)|
| 2:43:07| the lack of support from the administration. And that's disappointing. Because at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9787)|
| 2:43:16| in our city's history, it should be easy for us to put towards $4 million at minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9796)|
| 2:43:26| towards violence intervention measures, especially knowing that we have federal funding coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| to support such efforts, and especially knowing that we have a healthy budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| city budget that would support it. I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| It seems like we're getting different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9822)|
| 2:43:51| direction, depending on the content of the resolution. We've had resolutions before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9831)|
| 2:44:00| previously that asked the administration to commit a specific dollar amount to a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9840)|
| 2:44:09| to a certain area of work. I'm curious why we're not able to commit a certain dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| amount to this area of work. Oh, I don't think anyone said that you couldn't leave the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9854)|
| 2:44:20| in there. You could leave the amount in there. It's just that that's a recommendation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9860)|
| 2:44:25| administration. It's not something that would compel the administration to add that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9865)|
| 2:44:30| budget. Because that's that's part of the executive responsibility, rather than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9870)|
| 2:44:35| legislative responsibility. Thank you for that clarification. I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9875)|
| 2:44:43| as a city council that we express our support through a dollar amount of the importance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9883)|
| 2:44:51| this work. Many of the groups that I've talked to who need support and need funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| have significant projects that would not be covered by a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9897)|
| 2:45:05| Many of them are in need of space to carry out their work, and could use funding support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9905)|
| 2:45:14| that. With the price of real estate increasing in our area, that's going to be a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9914)|
| 2:45:20| amount if we're able to really develop a comprehensive intervention in this moment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9920)|
| 2:45:28| truly have a long-term impact and ability to truly create a violence intervention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9928)|
| 2:45:38| This million dollars a year commitment is, I mean, it's a start. But we need the level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9938)|
| 2:45:47| commitment that Councilwoman Singh was discussing. And I would like to show that support through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9947)|
| 2:45:56| city council through this resolution. I would support us adding the $4 million amount back into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9956)|
| 2:46:03| the resolution if there's support for that on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9963)|
| 2:46:11| Thank you, Councilmember Parker. Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| So, when we've had the discussions before about violence interruption, what I heard was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| that was the start, and that we're getting started with a contract with Cities United,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| and that is to identify how we're going to do violence interruption work with existing partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9986)|
| 2:46:33| and people in the community. Is that correct? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| So, it's not a cap and a definitive million dollars per year, on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=9998)|
| 2:46:46| The other thing is the I appreciate Councilwoman Singh bringing this forward and working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10006)|
| 2:46:53| One of the things that stood out to me in the previous version of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10013)|
| 2:46:59| was the creation of a public safety resource center. And my hesitation was the putting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| cart before the horse. And I know that one of the things that came out from asking for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10025)|
| 2:47:12| resolution was that it wasn't in conflict or it wasn't in competition with what's going on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10032)|
| 2:47:18| Cities United. So, I'm a little unclear about what we're doing and what we're starting there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10038)|
| 2:47:24| that initial work with community and community groups and community partners and how that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| differ. So, I think the revised version is more complementary to what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10049)|
| 2:47:38| with Cities United. So, maybe that could get clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| I'd like to speak to some of that, if that's okay. Cities United is a piece, but it is specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10064)|
| 2:47:53| The mission is gun violence with young Black men and boys, which is incredible. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10073)|
| 2:47:59| that is the worst and the first that we need to deal with. But that's not, if we're saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| these funds are to deal with that, and then there's everything else going on in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10085)|
| 2:48:09| and it starts getting diluted by trying to address everything that needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10089)|
| 2:48:15| that's not enough money. I think it is tragic that we just made a decision for almost $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10095)|
| 2:48:24| and everything that I supported that for was all of the community projects that went with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10104)|
| 2:48:33| It was building a neighborhood. It was not just a building. It was resources. It was job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| opportunities. It was housing. When you deal with the trauma and the violence that is existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10120)|
| 2:48:47| within so many people's lives, it enables them to have jobs and to get housing. What is beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10127)|
| 2:48:56| right now is how I imagine this is Cities United is dealing with the most intense problem that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| have right now. I wanted funding. I would still like funding for the second tier of that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10141)|
| 2:49:10| which goes from, to me, it starts with violence in the home, and that's generational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| and it will rear its head someplace sometime and come into the community. The third tier is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10154)|
| 2:49:21| resources. United Way has a grant of $10 million to start working on poverty issues so that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10161)|
| 2:49:31| basic needs are met, and it feels like all of these things together, instead of with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10171)|
| 2:49:37| same groups at the same table. Right now, the University of Tennessee has a violence intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10177)|
| 2:49:42| Public health does. The DA's office does. There's so many different groups doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| and we need to be at the same spot. I never meant to say center as in literal. I meant that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10188)|
| 2:49:55| figuratively, so that was the first reason for the amendments, but, yeah, we have to be at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10195)|
| 2:50:02| same table, and the groups that are doing the work, that's part of empowering the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10202)|
| 2:50:08| Big respect to the larger nonprofits that exist. At times, that's like shopping at Home Depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10208)|
| 2:50:15| instead of a neighborhood store, though. We have to empower the neighborhood stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10215)|
| 2:50:21| so I do want to have, as we organize this, I'd like it to be outside of the city so that other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10221)|
| 2:50:27| groups can put resources into it, like the county, and the county mayor is in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10227)|
| 2:50:33| We need to have those resources at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| and this needs to go beyond what the city is capable of doing. We have to have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10238)|
| 2:50:42| nonprofit partners who are in the neighborhood seeing what's happening involved at that table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10242)|
| 2:50:47| too, as an equal member. If that answered your question. It does, and it really helps explain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10247)|
| 2:50:55| because I think that was part of the concern, is are we doing something that's already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| done, and how do you put a price tag on it when we don't know, you know, we haven't defined and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10259)|
| 2:51:05| had the discussion what it is, so how do you determine what the price tag is in advance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| that? I also really appreciate that you're highlighting that it goes above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10270)|
| 2:51:17| the city. There's so many of these issues. We all have a lot of constituents that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10277)|
| 2:51:22| really concerned. Everybody's angry and hurting right now for the families and the children in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10282)|
| 2:51:28| our community, and everybody wants to know how to help, and a lot of it goes beyond us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10288)|
| 2:51:36| There's so many things that are outside the reach of city government, the health care issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10296)|
| 2:51:42| I'm on the strategic planning committee for Knoxville Education Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| and we keep talking about things like third grade reading level and education and achievement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10305)|
| 2:51:50| graduation, and all of these things play into that, and they're not within, there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10310)|
| 2:51:57| that we can legislate at this body to change some of these things that are all factors, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10317)|
| 2:52:03| that's the frustration to me, is that it's multifaceted. We can't sit here and say we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10323)|
| 2:52:09| going to throw $4 million at something or $10 million at something and solve a problem until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10329)|
| 2:52:14| all the partners are at the table and participating in the solution, and I will say, I hope I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10334)|
| 2:52:21| out of turn speaking here, but when we have these conversations with the strategic planning group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10341)|
| 2:52:26| working on Knoxville Education, people are like, we've been talking for a long time about meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10346)|
| 2:52:31| third grade reading kind of as a bottom achievement level that we keep not getting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10351)|
| 2:52:39| and people are tired of us, not us collectively as a group, but as a society, constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10359)|
| 2:52:45| acknowledging we know what the problem is, we just aren't making it, and we're not solving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10365)|
| 2:52:51| the problem, so I think it's really important that people accept that we all have to be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10371)|
| 2:52:57| the table, all entities, all government levels, otherwise we're spinning our wheels and throwing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10377)|
| 2:53:04| pebbles, and it's super frustrating, so I would rather see something that's multi-governmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10384)|
| 2:53:15| you know, or multifaceted, you know, the schools, the county, the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| the federal partnering on something to actually make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10400)|
| 2:53:29| Council, before we move to the next council member comment, Raquel Brown is the one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10409)|
| 2:53:35| who has spoken up, who signed up to speak on this item. Ms. Brown, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10415)|
| 2:53:46| Ms. Brown. Mr. Johnson, is she on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10426)|
| 2:53:49| She is, ma'am. She's using an old version of Zoom, so I had to promote her to be a panelist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10429)|
| 2:53:56| Okay. She needs to unmute herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10436)|
| 2:54:00| Ms. Brown, can you hear us? Can you speak so we can see if we can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10440)|
| 2:54:08| Yes, I can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| Okay, thanks. Please start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| and then you'll have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| Thank you so much. My name is Raquel Spencer Brown. The address is 7031 Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10458)|

| 2:54:30| members, but I wanted to address a few issues. It is good. First, Mrs. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10470)|
| 2:54:36| thank you so much for speaking up because I agree we should not have backed down or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10476)|
| 2:54:40| $4 million should not have been omitted from the ask because that is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10480)|
| 2:54:47| Again, we will be a complement, a tool to assist Cities United. Cities United seems to be more like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10487)|
| 2:54:54| a consulting firm. They'll be able to come and tell us how to develop these teams, but if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10494)|
| 2:54:59| funds is not available for them to actually start and train these teams, then the project is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10499)|
| 2:55:07| to fail. Also, if they start their projects, their projects is normally closer to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10507)|
| 2:55:14| where the violence is. Just like the police, there's a lot of reactive services, violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10514)|
| 2:55:20| interrupters, trauma and crisis teams. Those are where they're focused, but we're asking for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10520)|
| 2:55:27| $4 million to do the work that will try to hopefully stop allowing these incidents to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10527)|
| 2:55:34| progress to violence, to the gun violence outreach. So what we're trying to do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10534)|
| 2:55:41| there has to be additional different type of programmings for prevention and intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| They have to be broken down by age groups because one won't fit all sizes. So for to build healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10545)|
| 2:55:51| brains and stuff, we need programs from zero to eight years old to try to teach those family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10551)|
| 2:55:57| members how to protect these children and how to teach them particular skills. Then the other age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10557)|
| 2:56:02| groups that may be nine to 14, they may learn a different skill. It may be prevent for some who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10562)|
| 2:56:08| have never been exposed, or it may be intervention for those children who have already been exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10568)|
| 2:56:13| to violence or a community full of violence, domestic violence, different type of ACEs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10573)|
| 2:56:18| traumas, which includes sexual, verbal, physical abuse, substance abuse, a parent in and out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| jail. So if we can offer those additional programs on the community level, then it will help those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10584)|
| 2:56:30| at the end where if someone seeps through and there is a violent act, that would be where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10590)|
| 2:56:38| Cities United and the police department would take over. But again, there's no way in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10598)|
| 2:56:46| that $100,000 can save any of this. And the reason why $4 million will be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10606)|
| 2:56:52| because if Andre starts with just one program, if he just does the interrupters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10612)|
| 2:56:57| and the case management, the trauma, and other services aren't already put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10617)|
| 2:57:02| then it's going to fail, because they each need each other to stand. So it's very important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10622)|
| 2:57:07| we have everything put together so we can all run at the gate evenly right on time. So when one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10627)|
| 2:57:13| goes wrong, another one's already in place to catch all, to help people be, to build support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10633)|
| 2:57:19| to help them through the journey and help them not be falling through the crack. So it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10639)|
| 2:57:24| important for the money to be allocated so we can do that. I like to say we're on a campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10644)|
| 2:57:32| Leaves Against Lives. There is in the budget, I only found it, it was under public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10652)|
| 2:57:37| we're in the budget 19, 20, and 21, there's $8 million for trash and leave pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10657)|
| 2:57:44| And we're saying that we have $100,000 to fix the violence and stuff that's going on in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10664)|
| 2:57:50| community. And for those who are in power not to speak up enough to say that is not enough for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10670)|
| 2:57:56| to do anything for the children, thank you, that is a start, that is a start for us to do workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10676)|
| 2:58:01| development. But if the hearts are broken, if the minds are broken, if their spirits are broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210420?start=10681)|
