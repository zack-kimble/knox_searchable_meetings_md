| 2:14:25| And I'd like to offer this body, I was asked about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8065)|

| 2:15:04| I've got 37 years' experience in the Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| I'm a crime fighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| And if you choose me, that's what the Sheriff's Department will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8111)|
| 2:15:18| I don't play golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8118)|

| 2:15:32| I've not done a Police Department budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| But I have done a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| When I was the Master at Burlington Lodge, we did a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| And I've helped with the budget at FOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| And you asked me about supervising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| I've trained police officers, new police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| I've trained new investigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| You can call that supervising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| I chose to be an investigator in the career development program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8161)|
| 2:16:10| I started in the Police Department in the 80s, 82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8170)|
| 2:16:19| And I chose the investigator field rather than the supervisory field because, as I said, I'm a crime fighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8179)|
| 2:16:26| And that's why I didn't choose the supervisory field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8186)|
| 2:16:35| But if you pick me, that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8195)|
| 2:16:42| We'll fight crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8202)|

| 2:23:32| Mr. Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8612)|
| 2:23:42| Who are we missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8625)|
| 2:24:04| The Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, we're back from recess to start our installation service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8644)|
| 2:24:13| First, we will have invocation by Gail Lyons, chaplain of the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8653)|

| 2:24:42| Let's pray together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8682)|

| 2:25:33| Thank you, Father, for this day, and I commit these precious people to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8733)|

| 2:25:43| Can we stand for the pledge of allegiance to the flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8748)|
| 2:26:08| We will now have remarks from our mayor, Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| Thank you, Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| Let me begin by saying congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Congratulations on a couple of fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| First of all, congratulations on what I thought was a magnificently run process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| People had an opportunity to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| They could have their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| I think the 11 commissioners who were in place listened and made wise, wise decisions going forward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| So for that, I applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| To those of you who are coming into office, you have a magnificent opportunity in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8798)|
| 2:26:45| Together, we have a truly revolutionary opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| At this point in time in our community's growth and our community's history, we can take a quantum leap forward to ensuring that trust returns to our government, that we act in a civil manner, that we do the right things, and together we build a community that each and every one of our citizens can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8809)|
| 2:27:07| I think in the next couple of months, there are some wonderful things we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| Together, we can go forward and make a giant step in ensuring that every one of our children go to great schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8831)|
| 2:27:18| We should never allow a child's education to be determined by their zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| And looking forward, our children today need that education more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| That's a huge part of our budget and something we'll be working on together, I hope, and I'm optimistic that we can, along with the Board of Education and the school administration and our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8846)|
| 2:27:35| Secondly, we are really in a unique position as it relates to employment opportunities for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| Right now, Knox County has the lowest unemployment in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8864)|
| 2:27:45| Family incomes are at an all-time high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Capital investments are at unprecedented levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| But together, we need to build on that, just not accept the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8870)|
| 2:27:54| And we have a workforce summit that's coming up on March the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| I hope that each and every one of you will plan to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| We need a blueprint to ensure our community's future economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| And together, that's something that we can work for and achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| I think we also have some obligations we need to fulfill to our senior citizens and our veterans and to our young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8888)|
| 2:28:15| And those are obligations that we should take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| I hope that you will visit our senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| I hope that each and every one of you will make an opportunity to visit our Veterans Administration Nursing Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8900)|
| 2:28:26| which wouldn't have been possible in this community without the commitment of our Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| And I hope you'll take some time to deliver mobile meals so that we never lose sight of the fact that there are some in this community that are less fortunate than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8910)|
| 2:28:39| And it's our obligation to make certain that their needs are addressed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| I hope you'll spend some time visiting our pre-kindergarten program and also look at our birth-to-kindergarten initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8922)|
| 2:28:49| Cutting-edge-type programs that are going to ensure that future generations of Knox Countians are competing on a level playing field from children across this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8929)|
| 2:28:58| And also, as we go forward, I hope we can return to working together in the most civil fashion possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8938)|
| 2:29:05| I think in the last election, our citizens sent a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8945)|
| 2:29:09| They said they're tired of the discord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| They want us to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| And you have my personal commitment that I'm going to go beyond meeting you halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| I'll go as far as it takes to work with you in any way possible to move this community forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| So, again, we have a wonderful opportunity ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| This is a great time, I think, to be a leader in Knox County because the citizens want us to do good things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| and now it's our obligation to fulfill their desires and push this county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| So, again, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| I think Commissioner Strickland will be mentioning we have an orientation session scheduled on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| I hope each of you will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| We'll try and give you the information you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| And any time that the mayor's office can be of assistance, we stand ready and able to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8986)|
| 2:29:51| Again, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| I'm proud to be your partners in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| Best wishes as you go forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080220appointmentsswearingin?start=8997)|
