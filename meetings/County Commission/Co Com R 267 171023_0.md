| 0:01:00| The first item on the agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=60)|

| 0:01:07| Could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Sharon Smith, 3109 T Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, thank you for the opportunity to come before you to speak at public forum this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=75)|
| 0:01:22| I am currently representing the Friends of the Library, and we are just here to thank you for your support of the Knox County Public Library System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=82)|
| 0:01:30| Marita Black and her staff do a phenomenal job here for us at Knox County, and we are thrilled to support them in their endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=90)|
| 0:01:38| From programming to storytelling, imagination library, they're currently doing the initiative of the Big Read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=98)|
| 0:01:48| There are so many good things happening all around us here in Knox County through our libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| and we just ask for your continued support and to think about us when it becomes budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| and if you have any questions, we're always available to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| But, again, we're just thanking you for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| We have provided some special desserts for you tonight, so I hope you enjoy those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| Matt Harris, if you will give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| Standing in for Matt Harris, it's Jacob Gibson at 1002 East Nokomis Circle here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you, Chairman, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| I'll be as brief as I can, and I've submitted a letter for your review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| Maybe after the meeting you can take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| That was just a few moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| I'm here on behalf of Verizon Wireless with respect to the Wireless Communications Facilities Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| which will be before you a little later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| and we've been glad to be participative along the way with the NPC and particularly with Jeff Archer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=169)|
| 0:02:57| in arriving at the proposed ordinance that's in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| We've still got a few minor things that we'd like to see revised at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| and I'll breeze through those if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Section D-3, the new tower development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| Section D-3 requires that all new cell towers are either type 1 or type 2 monopoles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| and we've got no problem with this except that there is an exception for cell towers to be above the 200-foot height requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=198)|
| 0:03:27| that the ordinance allows, and where you get above 200 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| we would argue that the structure should either be guide or lattice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| and in fact a type 1 or type 2 monopole structure that is in excess of 200 feet is very wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| and kind of a monstrosity and I think probably undermines the aesthetic spirit of the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| So we hope you keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| The other thing, number two, is the setback requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| There's 110% of the height of the tower setback requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| and obviously this is for safety reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| so in the unlikely event that a tower collapses, that it doesn't fall on other structures nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| towers these days are designed to sort of collapse in on themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| and we would argue that with the certification from a structural engineer that a tower is designed to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| and in the unlikely event that it collapses is assured to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| that this setback requirement ought to be relaxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| And a lot of municipalities are doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| Number three of four, I'll be done very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Section E provides that any tower within an industrial office or commercial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| that is within 200 feet of a residentially zoned property shall be a type 1 monopole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| and shall not exceed 125 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| The 125-foot height limitation, respectfully, we would argue is an arbitrary limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| There's no real reason for this number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| and in fact when you impose that kind of restriction on the height of a tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| you have to build more smaller towers in order to provide the coverage that people expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| Where you can't build more smaller towers, people are left without the coverage that they expect and they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| Number four, finally, maximum tower height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| We respectfully submit that the tower height limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| applicable to non-residential zoning districts be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| At present, under the table in the ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| heights in industrial districts are limited at 200 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| heights in office commercial districts at 150 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| and heights in all other districts at 125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Again, we feel these numbers are somewhat arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| And it's worth noting that carriers don't build towers any higher than they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=341)|
| 0:05:50| It's expensive to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| So there's not this concern that we're going to build to the moon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| We hope to arrive at something that's safe and aesthetically pleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| and which balances those needs with the needs of consumers here in Knox County for good coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=361)|
| 0:06:09| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Jacob, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| You had mentioned that other municipalities have been going in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Can you cite what other municipalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| I can't point to any specific ones. I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| But I'd be happy to follow up in a supplemental email or brief to you with those examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| Okay. Thank you. That would be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Sure. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| If you would, please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| It's Barbara Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| This afternoon I sent to you folks an email containing a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| When I was with you at last month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| I had a lot of questions regarding the behavioral health urgent care center that's in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| and I wanted to follow up because I was asked to present those questions in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| So I did that, and I also provided you with some other information regarding other grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| that Helen Ross McNabb has received, specifically the one on the 2013 through 2016 pretrial diversion grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=448)|
| 0:07:38| And I have brought with me tonight some printouts of what I sent you in case any of you needed to have it printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=458)|
| 0:07:47| But I just wanted to present this information to you so that you could understand where we're coming from in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=467)|
| 0:07:57| and also understand how easy it is for programs and grants to get diverted into morphing into something other than what was intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=477)|
| 0:08:10| That grant that was given to Helen Ross McNabb for nearly a million dollars was intended to divert 1,250 people through the pretrial process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=490)|
| 0:08:22| and in actuality diverted less than 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| So we are concerned that the money that's being invested by Knox County into this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=506)|
| 0:08:37| is going to what it was designed to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| Now that this building is in our neighborhood, we want you to understand we want it to be a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| We want it to be a success because that way we will feel that it was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| We want to make sure that those funds are going to what they were intended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| and that the people that were intended to be served are in fact served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| And we also want this program to provide insight into what works and what doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| when it comes to pretrial diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| So we are telling you that we are willing to help and we are willing to participate in oversight on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=562)|
| 0:09:33| or in any other way you think is appropriate for us in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| We hope that you will use your influence with the mayor and direct him to have those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=580)|
| 0:09:50| who are responsible for oversight within the county to work with us and to help us participate in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=590)|
| 0:10:00| The mayor, this is his last term and y'all are going to have this around for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| And we're just hoping that it doesn't turn out to be a tar baby from which you can't extrapolate yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| So we're hoping that we can work with you and any other information that we can provide for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=612)|
| 0:10:20| we will be happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Ms. Koch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I've looked at your list of questions and these are all very good questions to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| if we're getting good utility of our tax dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| I would like for you to get with Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| I think he will be the person that from the county will be coming up with how we measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| and judge the success of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| He may be able to get you your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| I just want to say thank you, Ms. Koch, for coming out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| and telling us that you're going to work with all of us because we all want the best to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| And I can assure you, I think I speak for everyone on here on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| we will make sure that it is being done what was supposed to be in the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=673)|

| 0:11:24| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Ms. Koch, in your letter on number three, it calls for a community policing station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| and a reception center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| What is your interpretation of what this should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Well, we would like to see at least what the Sheriff's Department calls precinct kind of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=702)|
| 0:11:51| that it puts a visible presence of officers on a regular basis, not just an office somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=711)|
| 0:12:00| We would like to know that there is a backup plan, a contingency of people that are available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=720)|
| 0:12:11| that could be immediately accessed at that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| We don't think that's unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| The Sheriff has things located in different, I've seen them in like shopping areas, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| So we would like to at least have that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Like a substation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Exactly, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=752)|

| 0:12:58| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=780)|

| 0:13:04| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| The ayes carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Mr. Nystrom, would you like to head down to the podium and Mr. Schauss or Trustee, are you in the off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Madam Clerk, would you please read the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=796)|
| 0:13:24| Whereas Jim Costa has been a volunteer of the Knox County Schools English Language Learners Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| at Bearden Middle School for the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| And whereas Jim Costa volunteers approximately 200 hours a year, which amounts to 2,000 hours over the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| And whereas Jim Costa is bilingual in Spanish and has some knowledge of other languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| And whereas Jim Costa's volunteer service at Bearden Middle School is in addition to his long history of volunteer work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| teaching ESL classes at various locations around Knoxville, especially Central Hispano these past six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| And whereas each school year Jim is assigned to one or two students who are struggling in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| and he works with them one-on-one on a daily basis in the school library or in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| to support their instruction with explanation and or translation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| And whereas Jim Costa has provided significant support to many students at Bearden Middle School over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| and he has become an invaluable asset to the English Language Learners Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| And whereas each year Jim likes to quip that he will volunteer again if his pay is doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| And upon an affirmation response, he'll say, nothing times two is still zero. I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| And whereas Knox County desires to recognize and thank Jim Costa for his service and contributions to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| and the many students he has positively impacted and advanced over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| Now therefore be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| The Knox County Commission hereby honors Jim Costa for his volunteer work at Bearden Middle School and Central Hispano| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| and his unwavering commitment to supporting the education of English Language Learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Jim Costa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the Public Welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| Ed Schaus, 1301 Wilshire Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| My son went to Bearden Middle School, 09 through 12 and so I had some fond memories of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| and developed some friendships there, which I still have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| And I actually chose that as my principal for a day, which I think we got coming up next month, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| And it was mentioned to me by a couple of the teachers, the hundreds if not thousands of hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| that Jim has devoted to the school and teaching, helping to teach foreign languages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| at of course zero pay and the things that were mentioned in the resolution that he's done around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| So I just want to thank Commissioner Nystrom and Chairman Smith for sponsoring the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| to honor a citizen like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Someone who does just something at no pay just out of the love of helping kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Mr. Costa, you want to say a word or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| I just want to say that this is indeed a great honor and it's one of the biggest honors of my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=977)|
| 0:16:26| I spent all my working years as a chemical engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| I was in the Peace Corps due to various places I've been around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| I speak several languages and when I retired I needed a reason to get up in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| and this has certainly provided it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| So it's probably helping me a great deal more than it has helped the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| I want to thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1011)|
| 0:17:21| Next on the agenda, Commissioner Nystrom will you give the devotional please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1041)|
| 0:17:37| Sure, my pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1057)|

| 0:17:55| and opportunities to improve our community that you often give us at County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| and through our public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| For all of us in this room, I always want to remind myself and all of my peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| that there are other folks in other places, in other parts of our world, other parts of our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| that would be grateful to have the problems that we get to deal with every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| And I truly mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| And Lord, I'm absolutely grateful for it because there are so many folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| who are not as lucky as us to be here in Knoxville, Tennessee, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| and in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| We're very, very fortunate to be here and we're absolutely grateful for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| So please guide us in our deliberations and in your name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1118)|

| 0:19:41| I have two additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1181)|

| 0:19:46| Two withdrawals, R-17-10-102, R-17-10-201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1186)|
| 0:19:55| One defer, that is R-17-10-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1195)|
| 0:20:08| Do I have a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1213)|

| 0:20:20| Have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I did need to ask Dwight one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1223)|
| 0:20:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Dwight, did you get the paperwork for R-17-10-407?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| I was trying to make my way to the podium to request a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| We actually did get the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| but the American Public Works Association contact was off on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| We got the paperwork back today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| but Mr. Starkey, who has been helping us with the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| is off today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| So we actually have the matter worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| but we need to defer at 30 just to get everything nailed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| What number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1259)|

| 0:21:15| This 30-day, would it delay you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| We're still okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Because we could do it pending, but you're okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| I think we'll meet our timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=1287)|

| 0:51:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Well, you re-do the nominations, but you can make a nomination at all before it'd be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| And I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3115)|

| 0:52:03| Do I have a motion to cease nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3128)|

| 0:54:39| Congratulations, Mr. Covington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| Madam Clerk, will you insert the names into the blank spaces and read Resolution 1710?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| That will be a resolution appointing Billy Stevens and Michael Covington to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3293)|
| 0:55:03| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| And the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Thank you to everyone, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3314)|
| 0:55:32| Okay, the next item is Resolution 406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| It's listed on page 11, but I'll be reading the revised version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| It is approving a memorandum agreement for the acceptance of $260,000 from LeConte Development, LLC for right-of-way access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3339)|
| 0:55:49| and for completion of required roadway improvements within the right-of-way for Chapman Highway and Access Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3349)|
| 0:56:00| I need a motion to start discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| I'd like to make a motion to approve, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Yes, I'd like to hear from Mr. Vandebate, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Commissioner Daly, Dwight Vandebate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| A lot of progress on this agreement this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Again, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| It came to you much later than we would have preferred, but I just don't know that that could have been helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| Everybody was working furiously on it to get it moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| We have retooled the arrangement substantially to put us in a position of more comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| and I think resolve some concerns that Mr. King may have had on behalf of his clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| The fundamentals of it have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| If Mr. King's client proceeds with the acquisition of this property, they will pay Knox County $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| Knox County will undertake to improve what's shown in Exhibit A as access road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3418)|
| 0:57:06| That is a public road, so all of the work that we will be doing would be improvements to the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| Those will include basically two major elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| One is simply improving the existing surface that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Mr. Snowden had an opportunity to drive it this week and found it in a state of pretty substantial disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| It's in need of maintenance anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| And then the addition of the facilities within the right-of-way that would be necessary for the site development to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| It takes out all of the complicated aspects in the first version of this that we were somewhat uncomfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| and I think Commissioner Anders, you may have alluded to these, receding and billing and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| All of that is out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| We simply agree that we will make improvements to a public facility within the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| and that the applicant will pay for the access control break as required by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| We're comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| I believe Mr. King is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| I shouldn't speak for him, but we have worked on it throughout the week, and I think we're in a pretty good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| I would be remiss if I didn't single out Jill Rosberg for endless patience and tolerance and hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| for coming back to us on iteration after iteration after iteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| And if you ever get fed up with her, Mr. Armstrong, you can rest assured we have a place for her at Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3500)|
| 0:58:29| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Yes, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Just for record here on this exhibit, A, this is going to be a new entrance off the exit ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| That is the access control break that Knox County is being compensated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3517)|
| 0:58:45| And TDOT will be responsible for the new entrance or the improved entrance on Chapman Highway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| As far as the work between, that's an interesting little angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| We would not be involved in the work on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| That stretch of Chapman Highway is in the city, so that would be between Mr. King and his clients and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3540)|
| 0:59:08| That area that's shaded in blue, that's the limits of the area where Knox County would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| I understand. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| Mr. Law Director, I'm sure you've read over this and everything in order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| Everything's in order. The rest of it's just a matter of policy, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Dwight has explained it very well, except with the limitation that you can't have Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| I thought I'd throw that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Otherwise, everything seems good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| A second to that motion on you cannot have Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| I had a chance to glance over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| This area needs to be improved and get it to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| I'm for it and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| One of the concerns that I spoke to last week is that it is in some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| It'll be in the city and hopefully it'll stay in the county for the next four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| That was one of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| That's not in the memorandum and I'm not asking it to be put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| Mr. Keegan, could you tell us a little bit about the development and what the plans may be, if you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| I know a lot of times they're secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| There will be multiple occupants, I think somewhere between three and five, probably, in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3626)|
| 1:00:39| We've been working pretty furiously on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| keeping the connections alive with some of the current people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| who have expressed and backed up their interest in being an occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| We think we're still in decent shape with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| I'm not at liberty at this point to start talking about who they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| but there's considerable interest in that particular area and that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| On the issue about hoping that it remains in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| help me, Mr. Law Director, there's no more involuntary annexation by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| You can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| The only way they can do it is if your client requests to be annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| I think I can deal with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| I can tell you my client won't be requesting it, but better yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| there will be a property owners' association on the development of this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3703)|
| 1:01:52| and anybody who has an ownership interest in the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| is automatically a member of that property owners' association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| The bylaws and the charter and all will be developed in such a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| that no association member will be permitted to ask to be annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| So I think that will deal with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Very good. That's great to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| You know, last week we discussed it, and I see this not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| with TDOT out of the picture, I see it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| I see that you're paying fair value market for this according to the federal codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| and all we're doing is approving, it would be like a brand new resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| to do an entrance to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| So there's not really, I don't see anything wrong with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| I look forward to it, and I hope it goes through 10-0 tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Yeah, Dwight, how did we, I guess the concern everybody had last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| was how do we facilitate the transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| and you're saying now they're going to pay us the 260| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| and we're going to make the improvements at our cost through that 260?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| We will convey, those funds will convey from Mr. King's client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| They'll go to finance, and we'll ask them to set up a work code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| so that we can charge to those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| However, the back office aspects of that are handled by finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| It's fine with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| It's just our intent not to charge our expenses to an existing project or other account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| So what happens if we find something that this $224,690 becomes $275,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| What happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| We assume the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Now, I'm comfortable with the numbers that we've given this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| but it's a good question, fair question, and we do assume the risk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| On the other hand, we are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| we're making improvements to a facility that we already own and maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| That is a much more comfortable place for us than what we previously had under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| The other thing I'd always say with a high level of confidence is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| when I hand a project like this to Jim Stoden, it's just bulletproof, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| I mean, it comes in on time, on budget, and nearly effortlessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| So we are assuming the risk, but it's not something that's going to keep me awake at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| I'd just kind of go back to we had an agreement with a developer at Oak Ridge Highway and Beaver Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| and it didn't end well, and so we need to make sure that we're not on the losing end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| I'm for this, but this has happened before, and we were on the losing end by hundreds of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| and so I don't want that to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| The one thing I would say, Commissioner, is there is an existing road there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| and we're going to be making improvements to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| So this doesn't entail some of the risks that we would have to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| if we were just plowing new ground entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| I think we're in a comfortable place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| The resolution calls for $200,000 in exhibit, and Commissioner Anders brought up the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| Your exhibit B says $224,690.31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Which number are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Really, in the memorandum of understanding that you have that I think Daniel Sanders prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| it should reference only $260,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| and those are the funds that are going to convey from Mr. King's clients to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| The exhibit B is simply a takeoff, basically, of what we anticipate our construction costs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| to finish out what's in exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| The remaining funds would simply, I assume, just go to the general fund of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| So really the only material figure for this discussion is the $260,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| that Mr. King's clients are going to pay to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| Beyond that, it's possible we'll bring this thing in for $190,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| It's possible it'll cost $210,000, $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| There's some contingency funds in there, construction being construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| I can't stand here and give you an exact to-the-penny figure of what this is going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Obviously it could come in on the low side, it could come in on the high side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| We're completely comfortable it'll come in under the $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| Obviously we'd like to bring it in at the figure that's in exhibit B or below, but only time will tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| Yeah, but we're going to spend up to $200,000, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| No, sir. We're taking on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| For the right-of-way access and the expenditure, up to $200,000 of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| I need to read the new header over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Are we on the new resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Look at the new resolution header.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Go to exhibit B, last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Yeah, exhibit the header of the new resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| Exhibit B calls for $224,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| The new 406 that you got before you is what you need the header to look at, not the printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| Hopefully we can get down there at that low, so thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| If we're taking on this project and we're going to do it ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| do we have any guarantees or bonds that the project will be completed, their private development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4046)|
| 1:07:34| The agreement that you have actually doesn't obligate us to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| nor does it obligate Mr. King's clients to convey funds unless they're able to obtain all necessary permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| So a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| I'm glad you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| If for any reason this project doesn't proceed, funds don't convey from Mr. King's clients to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| and Knox County does not undertake the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Both sides, we believe, are protected in the agreement that you have before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| We have a proper motion before us in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4099)|

| 1:08:41| Reverse reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| It says defer, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Yeah, I left it off of the defer, so it has to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| Do you still wish to defer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4134)|

| 1:09:34| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Yeah, I'd like to, if we can, if we can fit it in our three items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| I'd like to make a discussion item of fixing the urban growth question that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4179)|
| 1:09:50| There still seems to be MPC not agreeing with our law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| and so I think we need to get clarification and get that fixed legislatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| It's hurting our county financially, long-term financials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| and so we need to get something clarified on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| And I would also even throw out the discussion of the Private Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| that enables the MPC to overstep in such a way that they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| we have an elected law director and the MPC is making decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| and even if you get in, as we discussed, the sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| they've essentially passed a tax onto the, they've chosen a revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| or chosen some things in there that could cost us long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| I think that's questionable, so we need to have that discussion about MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| especially urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Is this the discussion item for the legislative meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Yes, we're talking about what we want to bring up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| I would like to bring up the DUI bill that was passed a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| that not only affects the solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| it affects the attorney generals and the prosecution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| so I'd like to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| That would probably be another private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| Correct, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| This is all we're going to ask our state reps to try to do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4278)|
| 1:11:26| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| One of the issues that I have that I wanted to ask them is the setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| and approving where modular housing goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| Once you set a modular house, you cannot, from what I understand from codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| is we cannot do anything about when it's resold, if it's an older home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| giving a CO inspecting it, see if it meets the standard of a living structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| where people move into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Also, they're not required to pull a set permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| which means some of the people get upset on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| and it doesn't meet the setback regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| and therefore it comes right back on the individual to have to pay to reset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| that structure on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| There's some way we've got to protect the citizens that are buying those modular houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| That all goes through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| We've got instances where a double-wide two-unit set apart for over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| is exposed to the elements, then it's put back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| Is that still livable when you put those two in there since it's been exposed to the elements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| And we cannot inspect, from what I understand from codes, inside that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| That's one of the issues I would like to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| The other issue is this finger annexation that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| There's been instances in the last little while in our district, in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| where we have an accident and you have one show up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| no, it's not in the county's jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| and the city shows up and they say, no, it's not in ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| and it just kind of goes back and forth and the accident sits there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| One of them had to sit there for over an hour before we got a state trooper to come and write up the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| So we've got to figure out how we can make this more, how you can decide whose jurisdiction it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| But this finger annexation is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| We need to make it to where you can tell where the differences are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| And that's one of the other things I want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| I bring it up every year, but it's a good year for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Lowering the administrative fee on sales tax that they return to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| We get charged one and an eighth percent for them to return our portion of our sales tax to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| and that's about $12 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| That's a big chunk that we could give back to the schools along to the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| We're paying $50,000 a year for situs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| How many mistakes are made in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| What's an average number a year that the state makes a mistake on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| So if you're going to charge us $12 million, let's get it right, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| Yeah, so we can get you that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| So usually we've never paid him under $50,000, which means he's always found $50,000 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| More times than not, it's $300,000 to $500,000 a year in mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| Also we include in that, which we will have to stop soon, is hall income tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| and that one gets to be quite large as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| I don't understand in the year 2017 why it would take you so much time to charge us one and an eighth percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4494)|
| 1:15:05| to refund us our portion of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| Because they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Because they can and they like that revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| There's no other reason behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| And I'm not saying take it all away but stair-step it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| As you are stair-stepping away hall income tax, stair-step away the administrative fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| Or don't brag about a $100 billion surplus, one of the two, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Mr. Caldwell, you may recall that we had Representative Zachary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| and Senator Briggs file that bill for us last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| It did die in the Senate committee because, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| half the committee members didn't realize their counties were paying a sales tax administration fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| and, number two, they didn't want to have Knox County be exclusive on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| I've talked to a couple of our delegation on this, and they're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| they understand where we're coming from, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| if we take that away from the Department of Revenue, where are we going to get it back someplace else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4577)|
| 1:16:25| I have talked to the Lieutenant Governor about sitting down with him and discussing this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| but at this point, unless we can get our own guys to agree, I don't think I'll pursue that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| I would say they could take it away from their revenue growth they show every year on their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| Well, the Director of the Department of Revenue said the sales tax administration fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| accounts for about $30 million of their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| I would say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| But, once again, they have growth every year, so if you can, we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| They didn't ask us where we were going to get our income tax money from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| They can do it if they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| I don't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| On that same note, I believe we've got the Tennessee County Commissioners Association meeting coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| This strikes me as one of those issues that I'm curious if we're the only county that is ringing the bell on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| and it seems as if that's one thing that if you look at it as a marathon and not a sprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| it might take two years of going to session in Nashville to influence this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| but we would probably be better off if we could start some grassroots work to inform our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| through the Tennessee County Commissioners Association to try and get other counties around the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| to get behind this talking to their representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| so we don't seem like we're one squeaky wheel in the state just asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| I mean, we all know it'll take, unless our representatives in Nashville are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| it takes more than two or three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| This would take a lot of folks to vote for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| and the only way we would get that would be if we had grassroots lobbying throughout the whole state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| That's a very good point, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| To follow up on that, Mr. Schoonmaker brought that subject up at the conference, I believe, last October in a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4702)|
| 1:18:32| and everyone, every commissioner in there was shocked that they were getting charged that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| So it has been brought before, and I'm sure Commissioner Schoonmaker will bring it up again at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| but it has been brought up, and they were shocked that they were getting charged that much in this day and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| So the ideal is out there, and I'm pretty sure we'll pursue it again in a week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| I would think that over the years, if we inform in this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| and then get there the public policy people for TCA to try to help lobby this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| that would be smart, and it's not going to happen in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| but I would think in a couple years we might be able to move the ball on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4749)|
| 1:19:20| Okay, did they give us a number of items we need to have this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Generally three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Generally three. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| That was a moment ago I was going to turn my light on and say that's what I thought we had done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| I really like the format that we're going to be under this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| and the county commission and the delegation will meet for an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| then there will be a lunch break, and then the delegation will meet with the Board of Education for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| Now, all members of both boards or both bodies can be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| but one hour will be about county commission, one hour will be about the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| and we have a list here of six or seven items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| Maybe we need to look at that list again next month and move our way down to maybe three or four items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4804)|
| 1:20:13| I have five items, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Yes, we have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4815)|
| 1:20:24| So we will have a further discussion next work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| I would suggest we have it as a discussion item again next work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Mr. Chairman, could you all email that list out beforehand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Discussion regarding the Audit Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| The Audit Committee met last week, I believe, and I was wondering if someone would like to give a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| I would like to address one issue or one item that the Audit Committee may be bringing a resolution to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4860)|
| 1:21:08| to discuss the charter as it relates to how we select and how long we retain an external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4868)|
| 1:21:19| There is some discussion that we might put out requests for qualifications every four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4879)|
| 1:21:28| and work with an external auditor for an unknown number of terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4888)|
| 1:21:37| That would be a change from what is required in the Knox County Charter right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| in that we can have an external auditor for a set number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| maybe renew it for a set number of additional years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| but at the end of two terms, then we have to go to a new external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| The discussion that will be before us within a month or two would be about how to change the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| This would require a direction from the law department about what might be legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| and then placed on as a referendum kind of idea or option at a general election maybe next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4935)|
| 1:22:30| I think that was the major item coming out of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| I thought the chairman of the Audit Committee did an excellent job of going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| and looking at actually what the charter of the Audit Committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| and going through it point by point and seeing if we're actually meeting all the objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| He's actually called for the next Audit Committee meeting, for instance, under other responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| They want to discuss risk assessment and risk management regarding the county's major policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| And so they're asking Mark Jones to attend there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| The other thing is there was a discussion item about the continuation of the officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| in the Finance Department of Knox County because within less than a year there's going to be a regime change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| And the chairman of the Audit Committee is very concerned that the relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5005)|
| 1:23:32| and the personnel that Knox County has currently on staff is doing such a phenomenal job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| that they'd like to see that continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| And most of the staff that's been in the county finance department has in excess of 15 years experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5022)|
| 1:23:51| So the point being you want that continuity to not only work with your internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| but your external auditor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| The other thing is the internal audit did a report back on the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5040)|
| 1:24:09| And they found like seven significant findings where the hotel-motel tax collection department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5049)|
| 1:24:17| had not kind of lived up to what they were supposed to be doing, I guess you could say, in simple terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| But it's all online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| You can read exactly what was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| One of the things was even though it was a minor dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| the individuals in the hotel-motel tax department for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| did not understand that their direction derived from a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5078)|
| 1:24:45| that was instituted through the Tennessee General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| And so they were forgiving penalties and interests on fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| because they were using the state rules instead of looking at what Knox County is chartered with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| So again, it was a very insignificant dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| but it was like they didn't know which rules they were supposed to be following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| And then also I think there was a discussion from one commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| that the report for the river sports outfitters should be completed in the next like three to five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5117)|
| 1:25:26| And that was basically about it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| Discussion of the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Commissioner Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| We met last Monday, and we did address the moving of the devotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| and the pledge to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| That will be in a resolution, I believe, next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| And the law department met with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| and we discussed at the Rules Committee some changes on emergency meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| and some clarification in I think three, if I'm not mistaken, Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| We've got three areas to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| I thought we might have that, but I apologize to Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| I did not tell her to get that to me, to get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| So as soon as she gets these new resolutions, we will send them out so you will have time to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| I hate to get information like we did a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| and we don't know what we're looking at five minutes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| That just aggravates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| But we will have another Rules Committee meeting on November 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| Drew, if you will check and see if this room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| If not, we'll meet in the commission room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| So look for some information coming before the Rules Committee as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| I wanted to add one thing, set in on that meeting and the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| In our work session, we do not have a public forum area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| And maybe not public forum is the correct word for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| but since we do the bulk of our work and have our discussions during the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| I thought maybe we need a place there where if somebody is in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| and they wish to address something that we will be discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| that they could let us know about it so that we're able to recognize them or not put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5237)|
| 1:27:29| I don't necessarily think it needs to be public forum where they can come up and just talk about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| Maybe we'll call it public agenda input or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| I think it needs to be consistent with your other agenda meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| It's just easier to call it public forum so that way they feel like they can come up and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| But I've often wondered if there's somebody sitting out there and we put something on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| they haven't had an opportunity to say, look, I'm here to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5269)|
| 1:27:58| Mr. Chair, it had been suggested by someone that we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| that they have a sign-in sheet and the item that they want to speak upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| and their name, the correct pronunciation so you will be able to pronounce their name correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| And also we suggested that these agenda items or work agenda items be numbered also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| so it will be easier for someone to say, hey, item number 61 or 43 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5302)|
| 1:28:29| We won't be saying having to turn a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| So we did discuss that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| So it's been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| Okay. And you're also meeting Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Can I just make a suggestion to the Rules Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| And it's reference to what you mentioned a minute ago about this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| that we just passed for the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| Behind the scenes, the law director's office did a tremendous amount of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| In fact, this resolution wasn't even printed until 4 o'clock today, which to me that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5336)|
| 1:29:05| This was not an emergency on the part of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| because we're not going to even start road construction until who knows when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| So is there a way that we can have a system where if it's on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| and if all the paperwork is not in by, say, noon on the Thursday before the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| that it gets an automatic 30-day delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| Because, I mean, between the commission staff and Jill and the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| they went crazy on this thing to try to get it to us by 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| And to me that just seems like a lot of work that we could have easily had everything ready for a November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5376)|
| 1:29:54| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| I believe that's everything before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| Is there any announcements that would like to be made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| Commissioner Ryde.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| I would like to give a large thank you to Knox County Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5408)|
| 1:30:18| Mike Dinella organized a work crew at House Mountain State Park, which Knox County looks after the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5418)|
| 1:30:27| I believe they formulated work that was going to go from, like, 8.30 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5427)|
| 1:30:35| And Mike ended up with getting out enough volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| I think they finished up at noon or shortly after noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| They had an excellent work day, and they did a significant amount of work on trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| and switchbacks and fence and stepping stones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| And I just want to thank Mayor Burchett for the work that Parks and Rec. did at House Mountain State Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5454)|
| 1:31:03| And then I want to make a plug for next Monday, I believe that's tax sale day number 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5463)|
| 1:31:16| excuse me, property that is for sale on the courthouse steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| but it would be in this room here for people that are behind on property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| That's next Monday at 10 o'clock, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| I do that on behalf of former Commissioner Ed Schaust and the current Knox County trustee, Ed Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5490)|
| 1:31:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Open streets will be this Sunday from, gosh, 4 to 6, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5513)|
| 1:32:01| It's in the afternoon, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Open streets down Sevier and Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| Ask the commissioners tomorrow night at the Low That Barbecue from 5 to 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| and I want to thank my three fellow commissioners for wearing pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| You are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| Yes, I wanted to announce that our mayor, Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| will be out at the Fountain City Library this Thursday, October 26, from 5 to 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| And then after that, you can come on down to Fountain City Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| We're having our annual spaghetti dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| It's 4.30 to 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| And also I wanted to announce, as we all got the memo about Mayor Burchett announcing the effort to raise funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5567)|
| 1:32:57| for the wreaths at the Veteran's Cemetery, I've had several calls on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| and that is going on now that you can sponsor to have wreaths to be put on the Veteran's Cemetery in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5582)|
| 1:33:13| And the deadline is November 27, and you can go online to get all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5593)|
| 1:33:23| I forgot the most important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5603)|

| 1:33:36| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| I wanted to let you know that the East Tennessee Military Affairs Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5618)|

| 1:33:51| You can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| Patrice over at the Knoxville Chamber is helping pull together tables for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| So please come out to support our veterans on the eve of Veterans Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| And on a completely unrelated note, if I might take personal privilege like Commissioner Daley did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| tonight my son is ranking up in scouts on his way to Eagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| He's getting about four merit badges tonight and is moving up in rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| He's got a Court of Honor tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| So if he's watching this on the home, if we taped it or if this is on in a rerun, I want to say, Trace, we're very proud of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5655)|

| 1:34:49| and we will be there to read and give them the proclamation we passed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5689)|

| 1:35:44| They do quite a bit of work for the county, and they're unpaid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| But they take in neglected horses from Knox County Animal Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| They're having an event at their place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5752)|

| 1:36:47| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| I recognize Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| Mr. Chairman, two matters you and I had talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| and I had talked about two matters involving the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| one of which is bottom page 18, 1I17RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| the request of Joyce Webb for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| Ms. Webb is here tonight, so that will not need to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| It will go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| She will address the commission in connection with that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| rezoning matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| But the next one on the agenda, 7D17RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| request of Clearwater Partners, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| I would ask that that be postponed for 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5861)|
| 1:38:02| I'll make a motion to postpone the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5892)|
| 1:38:23| First item is 9-B-17-SP, request of Knox County Commission for H.E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| Biddle III for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from R.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| Rural Residential to LDR Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| located on the southeast side of Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| southeast of Steel Road, Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| I am here on behalf of Mr. Biddle, and he is here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| Would you like to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| MPC report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| Sir, will you be speaking for all three of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Will you be speaking for all three of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| I believe so, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Let me go to MPC for their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| And do you need my name or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Not yet, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Well, I just want to do no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| We're going to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I just wanted to get you down front here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 13-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| to recommend denial of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| The Commission felt that the density proposed in the sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| would be detrimental to the site due to the topography of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| There were several comments made regarding the amount of grading that could occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| if the density permitted under the sector plan change were approved for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=5996)|
| 1:40:05| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, let me give you a little history on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| It has been zoned at planned residential at two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| and that is because under the urban growth boundary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| which I think Mr. Buch and Mr. Armstrong agree is no longer in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| this was in the rural residential zone, and only two units per acre were allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| Pursuant to that zoning, a concept plan was approved for homes, single-family detached homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6039)|
| 1:40:50| I've handed this out, and I'd like to pass that out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6050)|
| 1:41:09| You have in this overview a grading plan for the property prepared by Billy Fulgen of Fulgen-McIndoe Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6069)|
| 1:41:24| That shows a red or pink area that would be graded at two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| Mr. Biddle is now proposing 12 townhouses at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6091)|
| 1:41:39| To get there, he would require an amendment of the sector plan from rural residential to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6099)|
| 1:41:47| and an amendment or a change in the zoning from planned residential at two units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6107)|
| 1:41:54| to planned residential at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| The matter came to MPC back in the early summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| They denied the change in the sector plan and the rezoning because of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6124)|
| 1:42:14| It was appealed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| You all in July sent it back to MPC for consideration of low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6137)|
| 1:42:27| and planned residential at up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| As Mr. Green just reported to you, the MPC recommended that the zoning and the sector plan stay the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6153)|
| 1:42:42| because of the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| What Mr. Biddle is proposing are townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| And if he was able to build the townhouses, he and Mr. Fulgen, his engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| have agreed that only that portion of the exhibit I handed you all designated in light green would be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6177)|
| 1:43:07| Therefore, there would be less land disturbance than there would be building single-family detached homes at two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6187)|
| 1:43:18| As a matter of fact, there would be four 3.9 acres of less disturbed area on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6198)|
| 1:43:26| and there would be 36 percent less earthwork on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6206)|
| 1:43:33| So this, in effect, would uphold what MPC is concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| the land disturbance and the hillside disturbance on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| So that's why we're asking you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| I might point out that the entrance to the property would come out onto Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| directly across from a shopping center where Food City and other stores are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| And there's already a traffic light there that would govern traffic coming in and out of the shopping center in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6241)|
| 1:44:11| So you have basically all of the amenities there, and you have a traffic light already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| and the developer would line up with that traffic light there at Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| The utilities are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| You all heard a discussion last month about Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| It has really become a completely new neighborhood over the past 10 or 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| Right now, thanks to what Knox County Commission has done, as soon as the middle school is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| you can go from K-1 through the 12th grade at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| You have, at Pellissippi Parkway, Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| And I think there are somewhere around 10,000 students there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| so you can get an associate's degree and never leave the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| Also, you've got grocery stores, commercial developments around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| that basically provide all the services a homeowner would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6313)|
| 1:45:21| Furthermore, on the east side of Pellissippi Parkway, you have Westbridge Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6321)|
| 1:45:29| and then you go over towards Byington Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| You have all these other businesses over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| So you can live, grow up, go to school, and work within a very small area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6335)|
| 1:45:44| And that's the driver for people wanting to live out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| And there is a demand for affordable housing that you can have with townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| that you cannot have with big houses on big lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| I'm guessing, I'm not a realtor, but I'm guessing that Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6360)|
| 1:46:07| has the highest demand for new homes of any area in Knox County at this particular time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6367)|
| 1:46:16| for what I have just pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| So, Mr. Biddle, is there anything I need to add to your discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| That's why we're asking for you all to amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| to permit low-density residential at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| and amend the zoning map to allow up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| And if I have any time left, Mr. Smith, I'd like to reserve for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| I may have exceeded my time. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Would you come down, please? State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6414)|
| 1:47:01| Good evening. My name is William Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| And I've been in discussions with neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| and he's talked about the development of Pellissippi, the parkway and the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| and the schools and all of these things are great, and they are still ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| But he didn't get into the consideration of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| and what is going to happen to this area for living purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| And so I'm here tonight, and we seek –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| I'm sorry I'm going to read this because I don't want to take up too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| We seek your decision to deny this appeal for Mr. Biddle for two rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| I believe statements from our neighbors have been submitted to you and to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| in answer to the issues that were scheduled for this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| Now, as we understand it, these documents are also fully accepted as part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| Now, if it's not, we would like to know about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| and just get an understanding of where we stand in the written statement regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| Now, the zoning should remain a two-dwelling per acre as determined by this state growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6491)|
| 1:48:21| Now, the requested rezoning for five dwellings per acre is resulting, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| in about 144 units and is not in keeping with the immediate neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| And the hillside and ridgetop protection plan we call – I've abbreviated to HRPP –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| is designed to preserve our beautiful hillsides, our beautiful ridges of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6520)|
| 1:48:49| And we feel that it should be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| Now, the HRPP determined that a maximum of 62 houses could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| Two new subdivisions under construction right there within one mile of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| currently comply with that HRPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| The 144-unit subdivision will access at Steel Road and Hardin Valley Road intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6547)|
| 1:49:13| and that's not a good intersection right now because of the traffic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| It's going to be compounded by this because of the access to this development right at that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6560)|
| 1:49:28| And it's going to further increase this congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| Now, the 44-unit subdivision will add traffic also to the increasingly crowded Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6573)|
| 1:49:40| as just discussed, and the increasingly crowded and soon-to-be-impossible North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6580)|
| 1:49:48| We feel that the responsible development of this property is in keeping with the 62 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6588)|
| 1:49:57| The 144 units we don't think is a responsible development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| especially since you just mentioned that there's going to be a 30 percent upheaval of that hillside to accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| The MPC staff recommended that this rezoning request be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| Now, the MPC board voted unanimously to deny the rezoning request based on the merits of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6615)|
| 1:50:24| We request that the county commission also deny this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| Yeah, my question right now is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| I'm looking at the topo map on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Looking at the proposed drawing that Arthur brought, it looks like the color topo, I guess the gray, is the ridgetop, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6645)|
| 1:50:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| So it looks like this development does, everything is inside the ridgetop, the cutting of the ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| Is that how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| Based on what I recall in looking at the topo I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| they've tried to avoid the steeper areas and maintain the development on the less challenging topographic sections of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6671)|
| 1:51:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| So was the total denial, what was the denial based on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| Was it based on the urban growth plan or was it based on the hillside and bridge protection plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| Primary forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Also the sector plan for this area was updated and adopted about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| and the commission felt that with the recent revision or updating of the sector plan that that sector plan should remain valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6701)|
| 1:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| So you're basing that solely on the hilltop plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| What if it were three units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Would it still be the same hilltop protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| Hilltop protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| Because you've approved it at two and it's the same footprint at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Why did you approve it at two and not five, and the footprint's the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| That's my struggle really right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| And the challenge is that in looking at the zoning, we can't rely upon a particular plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| and the feeling of both staff and the commission was that we had to consider all types of development alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6741)|
| 1:52:29| if it were zoned for five units per acre, which could be something as sensitive as what Mr. Seymour provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6749)|
| 1:52:38| or something as egregious as grading the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| And so we can't, again, at the zoning stage, we can't rely upon one particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| We have to look at all options that would be available under that five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| That's what I have for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| I'll just be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| I'm really in the middle on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| I think it's somewhat a developable piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| but I'm uncomfortable by turning it loose to a total of five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| That's kind of where I stand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| I don't know what the rest of the commission feels, but, I mean, it's the drawing that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6798)|
| 1:53:24| and trying to put it on the topo map, it looks like the road goes right over the steepest part of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| Is that not the way you see it, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| I don't have the topo or the KGIS in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| I've got a black and white of the topo that's pretty small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| so I'd hate to comment on it given the information I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| Mr. Green, I was looking over the draft minutes from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| and Leo La Camera makes a statement in here something about plan for 62 lots was approved contingent upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| getting a grading easement on the property to the west, but that did not get finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6847)|
| 1:54:13| What do you suppose that meant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6853)|
| 1:54:20| I believe that was with regard to the driveway, and if I'm correct, I looked at Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| He has acquired that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| That's near the connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| If you look at the connection to Hardin Valley Road, the property, the road curves through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| Actually, it appears an adjacent property, but that has been attained by Mr. Biddle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| and so that's no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| Can you give your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| Rusty Biddle, 10784 Hardin Valley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| I have not attained that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| Through working with Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| we shifted the road over a small amount as to not have to have that grading easement on the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| If I could say one other thing to speak to Mr. Anders' concern, and I've made this clear to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| the plan that is currently approved, we plan to use that same exact road structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| and not change it in any way other than to make the road steeper going in to disturb the slopes less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6923)|
| 1:55:30| I don't mind being held to the road layout that is currently there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| other than that one area down at the bottom that we had to shift a little bit to get off the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6934)|
| 1:55:41| We're trying to use the exact same footprint that was approved before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| but we will be moving a considerably less amount of dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| and disturbing considerably less amount of land as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| I think the only problem with that is if you've got the zoning and then turn around and sold it tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| you can't hold that next owner to the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| So I don't know that we can make that stipulation based on this site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| I'd ask Dan Kelly, last time we came through, if I could submit my concept plan at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| Unfortunately, that's not allowed, so my hands are bound there. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| Arthur Seymour again. I think MPC certainly can hold us to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| because we're asking for a planned zone that will have to go back for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| I've given Mr. Green a copy of the exhibit I gave you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| and he and his staff certainly have the authority to hold us to that on the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| and we're happy for any condition that you all want to put that we will disturb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| no more than what is shown on this exhibit from Mr. Fulcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| And that could be binding on any subsequent purchasers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7014)|
| 1:57:03| Mr. Johnson, do you have anything else you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| Bob Vallica, 1833 O'Ranchell Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7030)|
| 1:57:21| I've heard at one of their meetings is if the number of units exceed, is it 75?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| Traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Traffic impact analysis needs to be done on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| There's no mechanism I'm hearing here tonight at the two points that are being under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| that say this will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| Like Mr. Andrews has said, if Mr. Biddle sells the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| none of the guarantees that you've given tonight are legally incumbent on the new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7068)|
| 1:57:57| If you're changing it to five, it's carte blanche, as the MPC has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| And that's the reason that they've denied is because there's no specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| here's what we're going to do plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| And so what you need to do is start like you did with initial, like all projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| Like the Healy Homes did next to O'Ranchell Trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| They started and went through the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| And now they're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| If you want to do 144 townhouse units here as a county, follow the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7108)|
| 1:58:37| Have a traffic study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| Evaluate the ridge top plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| See how it fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| It seems like the cart is getting in front of the horse in this process at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| Go back and come with a specific plan that you're going to use that's just going to be built here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| and evaluate that on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| Right now the only thing I see above you guys there is rezoning and rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| with nothing about what's going to happen if you go to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| No guarantees that the HRPP will be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| No guarantees that the traffic studies will be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| I think that's what the MPC is trying to say in their denials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| When I watch the videotape online, it's real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| Just follow the whole process from beginning to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| and all these issues will be asked and answered and looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| You may very well wind up approving three or four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| but it won't be based on promises and assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| It will be based on cold, hard facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Just to clarify a couple of things, the process that's being used is the correct one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| It is somewhat challenging in that you have to provide the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| with the parameters within which to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| before the property owner can prepare plans for that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Once the plans are prepared, they're reviewed and must comply with certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| One of those is if there are more than 75 units, a traffic impact analysis is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| Those are the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| We don't require someone to come do a plan for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| before we consider rezoning that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| We set what we feel is a logical process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| We set the parameters, and as the development plan unfolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| the standards come into play at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| In terms of setting conditions on zoning, that's a slippery slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| and I'm sure Mr. Sanders can provide more information with regard to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| but the setting of conditions is not always smiled upon by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7255)|
| 2:01:05| Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| This board has authority to impose conditions on a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| What we have to be careful of is to avoid contract zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| where we have negotiated an agreement with the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| and according to that agreement, granted the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| In the past, you all have imposed conditions with respect to roads and access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| There was one that I can remember on Outlet Drive where the board passed the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| subject to the condition that access to the property be off of a certain road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| Those are unilateral conditions imposed by the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| or the grant of the authority to use the property, and those are legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| What you can't do is negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| You can't have a quid pro quo with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| In this particular case, the zoning could be conditioned on placing the road in a certain place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7328)|
| 2:02:19| or conditioned on access at a certain place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| Then the question does become, what are the particulars of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Do you have information in front of you sufficient to make those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| in a reasonably articulate way that will be enforceable later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| that gives direction to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| when it then does the planned residential review later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7362)|
| 2:02:49| Those are more technical issues, and I'll let the MPC talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7369)|
| 2:02:57| There is a record here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| Can the board look at some document in the record and say this is a condition of the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| that then can be enforced by the Metropolitan Planning Commission in a later review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| That's more of a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Mr. Law Director, could the sector plan be changed to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| and the zoning at five units per acre be conditioned upon attached townhomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7399)|
| 2:03:26| Excuse me, conditioned on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Attached townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7408)|
| 2:03:36| I think, yes, it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| because it's not been in a condition that's been negotiated with the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7421)|
| 2:03:49| It appears to be a condition that is imposed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7429)|
| 2:03:56| Yet, before you get to that point, you still need to pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| and meet the particular requirements in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| for granting the rezoning and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7445)|
| 2:04:11| Those are well outlined. We're well familiar with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| It's on the applicant, it's on the property owner to establish those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| and to prove to you that they've been met before you then have the authority to grant them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7460)|
| 2:04:29| It's a fairly lenient standard of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| but normally in a situation where we have an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| we'll have a record from the Metropolitan Planning Commission that establishes those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| In this situation, we do not have such a record from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| In fact, they denied both applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| It's still within the legislative body's authority to grant it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7492)|
| 2:05:01| but you need to be cognizant of the conditions that are necessary to exercise that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7501)|
| 2:05:09| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Mr. Green, this is the second time it went to MPC commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| Was there any big, you know, 7 to 7 vote or 8 to 7 vote or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7517)|
| 2:05:25| or is it still a unanimous denial basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| It was a unanimous denial, 13 to 0 yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| I mean, I think, again, the MPC had two shots at this and they came back and didn't even waver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7534)|
| 2:05:43| To me, that should send us a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7543)|
| 2:05:57| Any more discussion or do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7557)|
| 2:06:04| I'm prepared to make a motion if Commissioner Anderson's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7564)|
| 2:06:12| I just think 5 is risky, and I think there's too many unanswered questions as to what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7572)|
| 2:06:21| I'm a little unconfident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| This goes all the way up the ridge and it hits a lot of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| and I'm not a huge fan of the ridgetop protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| but I think we've had some issues on the front of this property before with drainage and dirt and sediment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| and so I'm just a little nervous about this, looking at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| and studying the property a little bit, going out there and looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| I don't know what the right answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| I want somebody to be able to develop it because it's their property, but what's the grade up the hill there, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7606)|
| 2:06:56| On the plan we're approved on, it's 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| We're trying to take it to 16%, which disturbs less dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| That's our whole purpose is to make the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| So the road will be on a 16% grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| That's correct, which is within the Knox County guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| It's 12% right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| It's 12% right now, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| But you want to take it to 16% for the townhomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| That allows us to disturb less of the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| That's the whole purpose in going steeper with the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| You don't have to do as many step-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| If we're doing a large seat for a house, it's a 60-foot house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| you have to have about a 100-foot wide pad, which puts these huge two-to-one slopes between every pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| If we're doing a 20-foot wide product, we can step between the product about one foot eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7659)|
| 2:07:44| and we don't have to do any of those big cuts in the sides of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| That's why the earth volumes went down so tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| Explain the 3.9 acres, 18% less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| So you're disturbing four acres less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| So these units are so much smaller, we don't have to grade the lots as deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| and, as well, the road being steeper cuts the volume of dirt down tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| We're probably cutting 8 to 10 feet less into the slope with this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| versus the plan that's already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| We're using the exact same road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| We're just not cutting into the slope as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| Mr. Green, what's the acceptable grade of road in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| It's up to 18% with special approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| And you may not know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| Rusty, what's your road that comes off of Hardin Valley up to Carmichael?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| Valley Vista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| I think it's 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7724)|
| 2:08:52| Sixteen percent grades are used quite often in subdivisions with steep grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| It's pretty normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| I drove up Valley Vista the other day, and it's a decently steep road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| Four more degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| Again, it's just a short portion of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| It's not the entire road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| It's probably several hundred feet, and it rolls into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| and then as you get to the top, it rolls back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| Take into consideration what we're approved to do currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| and you guys don't have the plan before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| but when we get to the top of the ridge, we are cutting and filling that whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| so it's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| If we do the townhomes, once we go to the top, we can follow the terrain more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| and not have to cut all those ridge tops off, if that makes sense to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| We're trying to disturb less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| That's the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7780)|
| 2:09:51| Could I not be held to the same exact road system that's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| with less disturbance of the earth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| If there can be some restrictions put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| Mr. Biddle, I was looking at this map of the non-disturbed area here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| and it's the one in the green that's going to be disturbed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| The red is the one that's currently approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| The green is what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| So how much setback do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| It looks like there's a big setback from all the property lines there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| We're not disturbing any of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| That's the whole goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| So any area that's not green would not be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| Okay, but what I was asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| it looks like a good portion of the property is not being disturbed now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7849)|
| 2:10:55| with this current plan that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| Do you know how much less property will not disturb this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| Do you have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| It's four acres less that we would be disturbing over what's currently approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| So that's the red area that you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| The red is the currently approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| The green is what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| I wanted to comment on what Mr. Schoonmaker said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| about MPC denying this for a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| We sent this back to them at LDR, and they denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| They often deny things that we do that we send back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| They have somewhat of a different objective than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| As the legislative body of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| we're in charge of making sure we have enough growth for taxes to open schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| to keep everything functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| They don't have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| That's the things that we have to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| I have one more question for Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| So we've got a one-year-old sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| with no comment by a property owner from the last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| What's the change that says we should legally change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7930)|
| 2:12:18| One, there has been an uptick in development in the area, demand for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7938)|
| 2:12:26| There has been a new school under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| I think simply, and at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| it was thought that the urban growth boundary plan was still in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7953)|
| 2:12:40| and it has been discovered that when Knox County Commission approved that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| the approval expired on December 31, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| It could have been renewed, but it never was renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| There is continuing population growth in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| continuing school improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| and eventually continuing road improvements in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| You already have the infrastructure, traffic light there, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| So I think this was maybe an oversight in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| or it was done because this area was thought to be in the rural residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=7995)|
| 2:13:22| which Mr. Armstrong has determined no longer is binding on Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8002)|
| 2:13:30| because of its earlier approval of the urban growth boundary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| which expired in December of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8015)|
| 2:13:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| In this whole process that you're trying to attempt to cobble together here with your rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8035)|
| 2:14:02| where would the traffic impact study fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| What if it comes back and says this is too many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| That's the question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| It seems like the process is getting jumbled here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| not following a nice, straight, logical path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| It follows the path that's set out in the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| The traffic impact analysis is submitted with the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| for the use on review subdivision or the plan approval of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8069)|
| 2:14:36| Traffic impact analysis identifies potential traffic problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| and identifies solutions to those problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| and recommendations for implementing those solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| So it comes with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| Prior to approval of the development, the traffic improvements have to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8089)|
| 2:14:56| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8096)|
| 2:15:03| It's our normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| When the traffic study is done, it is done on the use on review and concept stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| which would be the next two stages, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| I'd like to make a motion that we uphold the MPC decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| and deny the low-density residential sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8122)|
| 2:15:35| I'll second it for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8135)|
| 2:16:03| Point of order, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8163)|
| 2:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| All right, if it fails, I guess you've already just had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| Does it lock down the property for the next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| No, that's only a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| This is a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| This is a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| But if this fails, the zoning can't change, so it would just go away, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| Put it back at ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| The zoning could be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| We're talking sector plan right now, not rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| And I feel that the LDR should be the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| And we can come back later and set the density on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| So I would make a substitute motion to approve the sector plan change to LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8207)|
| 2:16:57| We can still discuss the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| Yes, well, that's the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8221)|

| 2:17:49| So now we have to have a similar discussion on zoning, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| Zoning, now we talk about zoning density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8272)|

| 2:18:39| Could we postpone the zoning for a month and come back with some fairly detailed engineering plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8319)|
| 2:18:46| that are not final for submission of the use on review but show you exactly how we're going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8326)|

| 2:19:09| And we will try to get those plans right away and then just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8349)|

| 2:26:41| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended 13-0 in consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| that the Commission approve the requested agricultural zoning for the 3-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| The rezoning would bring the existing buildings on the property into compliance with the zoning standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| allow additional residential development, and would be consistent with the sector plan designation for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8821)|
| 2:27:08| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| Make a motion we approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8833)|
| 2:27:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8838)|

| 2:27:27| Item 1-I-17-RZ is a request of Joyce Webb for rezoning from T Transition and F Floodway to OB Office Medical and Related Services in F Floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8847)|
| 2:27:38| Property located northwest side of Ebenezer Road, northeast of South Peters Road, Commission District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8858)|

| 2:27:49| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| Can we get the report of the MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended 14-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8875)|
| 2:28:02| that the County Commission approve the OB zoning and floodway zoning for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| This is a 2.23 acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| The OB zoning is compatible with the scale and intensity of surrounding uses, and would allow development that is consistent with the surrounding uses and with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8890)|
| 2:28:20| The current floodway zoning of the property would remain, and any development would have to comply with the flood regulations for development of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8900)|
| 2:28:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| My name is Joyce Webb, 10116 North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8917)|
| 2:28:47| I am here because I realize that the property that I'm asking to be rezoned has about 30 businesses within 3 quarters of a mile of 717 Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8927)|
| 2:29:07| The property is leased at this time, and I expect it to continue to be for a long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8947)|
| 2:29:14| Everything is very satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| I'm only asking for rezoning because should the doctor decide to relocate, then I would need to lease the property again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8956)|
| 2:29:29| and it would be rather difficult because it has two buildings on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8969)|
| 2:29:35| and it really would be best if it is in line with all the other property within 3 quarters of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8975)|
| 2:29:52| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| Mr. Green, would this not be changed from the OB zoning to the new supportive housing classification that we just got approved that was designated for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=8997)|
| 2:30:10| The zoning change would allow that use given the recent revision to the OB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9010)|
| 2:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9018)|
| 2:30:28| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9032)|
| 2:30:41| I represent the current lessee on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| I'm just confirming that it's currently zoned transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9047)|
| 2:30:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| The same use that is made of the property now, supportive housing, can be done in both the transition zone and the OB zone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9055)|
| 2:31:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9069)|
| 2:31:22| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Motion to approve MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9083)|
| 2:31:30| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9099)|
| 2:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| Item 7-A-17-CP is a request of MPC to adopt resolution 7-A-17-CP, approving the East Knotts Community Plan, updating the 2010 East County Sector Plan, and amending the Knoxville Knotts County General Plan 2033, and recommend the Knotts County Commission also adopt the plan by a vote of 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9105)|
| 2:32:15| MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| The plan before you for adoption is the culmination of about a year's work by the community in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9138)|
| 2:32:27| The plan outlines recommended policy changes and actions to preserve the character of the community while managing the growth and development that is sure to come to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9147)|
| 2:32:38| There was a fairly extensive public outreach as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| There were community meetings held at what for MPC and the community were unusual times, a Sunday afternoon ice cream social at a senior center, Sunday afternoon gathering at Seven Islands Birding Park, as well as the work of the stakeholder steering committee composed of members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9162)|
| 2:33:01| The community and the MPC recommend this plan for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| The question, I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| The things that are included a lot are the option of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9195)|
| 2:33:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| Is there anything in this plan that is prescriptive or new regulation of existing property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9207)|
| 2:33:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| Or existing uses or proposed uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| There are some additional tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| In fact, the staff is working on a rural preservation zone that will provide another tool for preservation of agricultural lands, but it's just a tool that property owners could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9223)|
| 2:33:58| Neither the MPC staff nor the planning commission will impose that on anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| It would have to be at the request of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9242)|
| 2:34:07| Also, recently it's been adopted the rural retreat provision that allows those who want to operate wedding venues or other event venues to do that legally, but, again, that's a request from the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9247)|
| 2:34:26| There's nothing in there that we would place on the property without the property owner's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9266)|
| 2:34:34| There's been a significant amount of work and meeting and an out-of-state advisor brought in to help formulate this plan, and it's what the people in the area are looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9274)|
| 2:34:50| and I make a motion that this request to MPC be adopted per their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9290)|
| 2:34:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| Proper motion to second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| This is Ordinance O-17-10-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| It's amended in Knox County Code Appendix A Zoning, Article 3, Section 3.20, Article 4, Section 4.92, and 22 zoning districts within Article 5 regarding standards for wireless communication facilities and rescinding the adoption of the wireless communications facility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9316)|
| 2:35:34| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9334)|
| 2:35:43| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9343)|
| 2:35:56| Can I get a report of the MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| I appreciate the support of the commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| There will be another vote, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| We're just getting you started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9366)|
| 2:36:07| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| I'm trying to get a word in before the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| The staff worked for quite some time on this ordinance amendment trying to reach a reasonable compromise between the providers of telecommunications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9372)|
| 2:36:23| and the residents who use it but don't want to see the facilities necessary to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9383)|
| 2:36:31| We've addressed a number of concerns and issues identified by the telecommunications industry with only one provider having additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9391)|
| 2:36:42| The height can be varied based on justification provided by the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9402)|
| 2:36:49| Even though the ordinance says 200 feet, the towers can go higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| If there's a technical reason, they can't meet the provision of service with a tower of less than 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9414)|
| 2:37:02| There are standards for spacing that can be varied if there are technical reasons for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| We went with the monopole type in lieu of the lattice because of the more aesthetically pleasing appearance of the monopoles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9427)|
| 2:37:18| I have seen monopoles more than 200 feet in height, and they are bulky, but they are less intrusive than the guide or the lattice-type tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9438)|
| 2:37:28| We've tried to address the setbacks to protect residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| Even though the tower may be in another zoning district, the setback is to protect those from both safety hazards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9453)|
| 2:37:42| any unwarranted safety or unexpected safety hazard, but also the aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9462)|
| 2:37:47| Again, we've tried to reach a balance, and the staff has worked quite some time, held public meetings, public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9467)|
| 2:37:54| worked with the representatives of the industry, both the providers and the cell tower companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9474)|
| 2:38:00| and addressed the majority of their concerns with only, after spending almost a year on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9480)|
| 2:38:05| only four concerns identified, and we think those are probably a bit over the edge of the compromise that most people have accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9485)|
| 2:38:18| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| When they first started putting cell towers and it was coming into Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| they put a provision in with most providers back then in our zoning issues that you could address these issues on a use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9506)|
| 2:38:37| the height, the way it looked, and things like this, and it was done on use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| and it gave the public a little bit more input on that use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9523)|
| 2:38:50| Why was the change made to what we're doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| What we've done is, if there's an increase in height or a decrease in the spacing or other special standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9534)|
| 2:39:03| it is a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| The towers in the industrial and commercial areas would be permitted administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9545)|
| 2:39:11| What we're trying to do is work with the tower companies to have them locate in those areas where the towers would have less impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9551)|
| 2:39:20| If they're in residential areas, they would still be a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| We're calling it a special permit as opposed to use-on-review, but it would require public review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9565)|
| 2:39:32| Again, we're trying to make the path easier to put them where there's less opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9572)|
| 2:39:40| and a bit harder path to put them where there's likely to be some concern or some residents who want to be involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9580)|
| 2:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| Mr. General, I guess we've talked a little bit about in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9594)|
| 2:39:59| and I haven't been as detailed in reading it yet as I'd like to have been, but knowing there's a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9599)|
| 2:40:07| are we looking at utility poles becoming cell phone towers in the near future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9607)|
| 2:40:13| That's more of the small cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| There is a move to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| What we're seeing is that the equipment is placed at a lower height and there's more equipment, less space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9618)|
| 2:40:25| and they're using utility poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| Are they using current utility poles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| They're using current utility poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| So we're not adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| They're not adding at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| And MPC staff work with the legal staff and with the engineering and public works primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9634)|
| 2:40:43| with engineering and public works to develop a separate set of standards for those small cell facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9643)|
| 2:40:50| that are located on utility poles within the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| And that's reviewed at this point administratively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| and there are some very good, what we feel are good standards, to God knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| that address the use of the poles, the location of that equipment, the size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| trying to make them as unobtrusive as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| Out in Pellissippi, between Kingston Park and 40, there's a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| I think it's a three-faced billboard, three ways, two or three ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| and it has a large cell phone tower in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| Have you seen that, and is that something that we've, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| if you have what some would consider a sign of blight, go ahead and put your cell phone towers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9689)|
| 2:41:35| Is that something we've tried to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| I've seen that, and we encourage that type of cell facility placement in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9696)|
| 2:41:44| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| Gerald, the small cell towers on the utility posts, that is part of the 5G push?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9706)|
| 2:41:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| In our latest magazine by NACo, there was an article in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9714)|
| 2:42:02| and there was some question about the radiation levels projected off of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| because of the depression and the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| Is there any consideration for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| And also, what do we do with these when we get out into subdivisions that have underground utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9731)|
| 2:42:17| and there are no utility poles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| The information that we've seen, and it's evolving, stated that the radiation was not a hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9740)|
| 2:42:27| Again, that's evolving, and more research is being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| but we'll keep an eye on that and watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| If it's a new tower to facilitate the small cell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9755)|
| 2:42:44| then we would treat it under these provisions as a new cellular communications facility device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9764)|
| 2:42:52| And also in the article there was the FCC committee on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9772)|
| 2:42:58| has still not set their finalized plans on the rollout, have they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| They have not, and there's some speculation that the FCC or even the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9782)|
| 2:43:10| could undo all the work that's been done on the local ordinances to manage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9790)|
| 2:43:17| That's what I was going to wonder. That's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| When Brad was mentioning the utility poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| KUB has agreed that they can put the small cell towers on KUB poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| but Lenore City Utilities, which covers the vast majority of West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9812)|
| 2:43:38| at this point has not agreed to allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9818)|
| 2:43:42| And if you look what the town of Farragut did on Parkside Drive in front of Red Robin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| you can see the green light pole with the small cell structure attached to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9827)|
| 2:43:54| and then the equipment is buried in a vault below it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| But that's what the trend is going to be in commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| Okay, what about on a residential, back to my subdivision with underground utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| in the right-of-way there, who will place the pole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| That's under Dwight Vandervate's jurisdiction at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| It's not going to be controlled by the MPC, and he already has a draft of the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9855)|
| 2:44:21| It's a 19-page document that's available now to tell you exactly what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| Who will receive payment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9868)|
| 2:44:36| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| Just to follow up on that, Commissioner Schoonmaker and I have been talking to Mr. Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9877)|
| 2:44:42| One morning you may wake up, or the next day you come home from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| and you've got a pole looking at your picture window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| And that's why this is important, that we make sure that these underground utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| that we put those poles in the correct place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| I don't want to look at my picture window and see a small cell tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9898)|
| 2:45:01| so we've got to be careful on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9901)|
| 2:45:10| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9910)|
| 2:45:13| We have a motion and a second before us, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| We started with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9915)|
| 2:45:23| Motion to approve on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| Back to Honey Badger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9934)|
| 2:45:42| This is the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| Did they get a letter on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| No, this is the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9949)|
| 2:45:50| I've got a feeling that this was on consent, and the property owner probably did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| He probably figured that it was all said and done, so we do need to notify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| And I'm pretty sure they will be here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| I have checked with MPC, and they do put in the application notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| that they have to be present at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| I did get a call from the gentleman on South Peters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9973)|
| 2:46:21| He was calling me to ask if he needed to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| and I haven't got back to him yet because he wasn't on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| But when does he come before MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| I'll have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| Three or four different agenda commission agendas start running together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9991)|
| 2:46:38| I'll check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9998)|
| 2:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=9999)|
| 2:46:40| So what do we need to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| Make a motion to defer 30 days and instruct the commission office to send out a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10002)|
| 2:46:51| I make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10011)|
| 2:46:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| We have a proper motion and second in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10017)|
| 2:46:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| Those opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10022)|
| 2:47:07| On both of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10027)|
| 2:47:14| That is everything, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| We need to remind ourselves we start a week early next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10037)|
| 2:47:26| Does anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267171023?start=10048)|
