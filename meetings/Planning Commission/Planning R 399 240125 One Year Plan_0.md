| 0:00:00| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=0)|
| 0:00:29| hi everyone. My name is Jesse Hillman. I'm a principal planner with Knoxville-Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| Planning and I'll be taking us through some of the proposed changes for the 2024 one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| If you are able, it'd be great if you could put your zip code in the chat just so we have a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| of where folks are coming from in the city to learn about this plan. So in general, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=48)|
| 0:00:59| going to do an overview of what the one-year plan is and its relationship to other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| We'll talk about the purpose of the one-year plan update and then specifically what's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| proposed for this year's update. We'll go through the maps that are available on our website with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=70)|
| 0:01:17| regards to the one-year plan and then go through the timeline for the review and adoption of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| plan and we'll have discussion afterwards. So what is the one-year plan? It's a plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=83)|
| 0:01:37| ensure that future zoning conforms to the community's comprehensive development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=97)|
| 0:01:45| It provides the basis for future zoning of all properties within the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| and this is important because any property's zoning change must conform to the one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| plan's land use classifications. So how does that relate to the other plans that are adopted within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=117)|
| 0:02:05| the city? So at the top there we have the 20-year growth policy plan. The current one was adopted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| 1999 and an update to this plan is underway now. The updated plan was approved by the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=132)|
| 0:02:21| plan committee recently. It's now being reviewed by the county commission and then will go before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| city council and Farragut for final review and adoption. And so what this growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| does is it maps various growth areas. So you have the city limits which are not really part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| but then there's the urban growth boundary just outside the city limits where reasonably compact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| development meant to accommodate the city's growth over 20 years is planned. There's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| planned growth areas where growth is expected to occur in unincorporated areas over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=174)|
| 0:03:02| And then there's the rural area which is land that's preserved for farming, wildlife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| and just rural character. And there are limitations to residential density in that area. So the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| plan does influence the sector plans in terms of the locations of different land use intensities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| Then we have the 30-year general plan. This was established or this establishes general policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| and principles to guide development. These principles inform the sector plans as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| The sector plans are community-based plans that provide policies and recommendations on land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| transportation, and public facilities that align with goals from the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| It guides land use and development through the land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| The sector plans also provide recommendations on capital improvements and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| There are 12 sector plans, six city and six county, though their boundaries are not aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| with the city-county jurisdictions. So there are portions of the city that are in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| sectors and vice versa. The reason for doing this was that breaking the geography into smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| sectors enables systematic updates that highlight specific community priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| which are also represented through the corridor plans, small area plans, parks and facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| plans, and the special studies that you see at the base of this flowchart. Once the advanced NOx| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| comprehensive county plan is adopted, it will replace the sector plans in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| but sector plans will continue to guide city development for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| The one-year plan was adopted by referendum in 1982, so it's part of the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Its purpose is to strengthen the relationship between planning and zoning. Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| previously, sector plans served as guides for zoning, but conformance to the plans was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| legally required, and that changed with the one-year plan charter. Any rezoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| within the city limits must conform with the one-year plan's land use classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| as well as the sector plans. The one-year plan also provides specific location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| for certain uses that inform development, like duplexes, mental health facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| things like that. It's updated on an annual basis, like now, and if a rezoning request requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| an amendment to the one-year plan, this can only be applied for on a quarterly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| so that's January, April, July, and October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| Within the one-year plan is a land use index in the appendix that's also provided on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| and it provides the most up-to-date reference for our land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| A key objective of the update this year was to improve consistency between the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| and the land use index. There are also efforts made to just generally simplify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| and reformat the plan for readability and remove redundancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| So, here's the landing page where you can stay informed on this update process. This is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| you can provide your input, which will be definitely taken into account as we develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| the final draft for adoption. What you're seeing now is just a rough draft, and it is subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| change based on public input. You'll see a summary of the proposed revisions currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| You'll see the 2023 plan, which you can reference. That's the one that's currently active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| There's a dashboard with different maps related to the one-year plan, which I'll get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| There's also that public comment feature, additional meeting information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| and my contact information is there as well. So, it's a great resource for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| staying current on what's happening with this update process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| So, in terms of actual changes that are proposed to the 2024 plan, we worked on Chapter 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=434)|
| 0:07:24| which is probably the most critical piece of the one-year plan. It describes all the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| policies and the land use classifications. We proposed removing agricultural conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| We proposed removing agricultural conservation and rural residential as land use types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| This is because they have identical recommended zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| with the agricultural land use type, which is the more widely used one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| There is actually only one property with agricultural conservation and one property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| with rural residential land use classifications in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| And these properties also meet all the intent and location criteria of the agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| use classification, which, like I said, has the same recommended zones and is very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| So, for those reasons, we recommended removing those two and having those two properties in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| the city reclassified as agricultural, which will have no bearing on their current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=504)|
| 0:08:32| which is already agricultural in both cases. So, in general, we kind of reformatted the description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=512)|
| 0:08:44| the location criteria, and the permitted zoning districts to align better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| with the formatting of the land use index and Appendix B. Our goal was really just to make them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| virtually identical so that, you know, they're both complete and consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| So, Chapter 2 of the one-year plan did take what was given priority if there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| some inconsistencies, but sometimes there were descriptions or location criteria in the index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| that were missing from the body of the one-year plan. And so, in those cases, things were added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| to the body of the plan, Chapter 2. Text was only removed if it was redundant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=564)|
| 0:09:33| inaccurate, or superfluous or excessive. I know these are subjective terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| so I'll provide some examples of what I mean. So, in some land use classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| there were repeated references to the type of street classification that a land use could access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| So, it would say, you know, must be on an arterial street. And then a few lines down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| it would say must be on an arterial or a major collector street. So, we would just remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| redundancies there. Another example is multiple references to utility access. So, it would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| must have access to water, sewer, and electricity. And then later on, it would say must have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=609)|
| 0:10:17| utilities. So, we just, you know, synthesize those so that it's simpler. In terms of inaccuracies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| one example of that was in the general commercial land use classification, it made reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| in Chapter 2 to how a limited range of warehousing and wholesale activities may be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=631)|
| 0:10:39| But those uses are actually considered more industrial and aren't permitted uses in any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| the zones that are recommended in the general commercial land use. So, we removed that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=645)|
| 0:10:53| And then, in terms of excessive language, there wasn't much of that that was taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| There was a mention in regional commercial of big box retail development, typically exceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| 400,000 square feet, which is just a highly specific and perhaps unnecessary square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=667)|
| 0:11:15| to include there. So, we removed that. Again, I do understand that these are subjective terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=675)|
| 0:11:23| that I'm describing. So, what I will provide after this meeting is an update to our one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| plan landing page on our website, where I'll show all of the edit changes. I didn't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| at first because there was a lot of just reformatting. So, it looks, it's hard to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| There's, you know, some areas where location criteria was added to the description, but wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| you know, it looks like it was taken out, but it wasn't, it was just moved around. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| just fair warning that it's, it looks more like more extensive changes were made than actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| were. The only meaningful change to a land use type that we're proposing is to low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| residential, which specified that slopes must be less than 25%. However, that's not really how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| this land use is applied in practice. You know, single family dwellings in combination with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| enforcement of the hillside protection overlay. It's one of the least intensive development types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| that there is, and it's probably one of the most appropriate for sloped areas. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| for that reason, we recommended removing that location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| The other main change we proposed was removing Chapter 4, which identifies conflicts between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| one-year plan land use classifications and the zoning maps. The presumption being that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=768)|

| 0:13:01| There are over 1600 of these conflicts, and this stems not from some grave error, but really from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| the differing premises of zoning and land use. Zoning is generally reflective more of historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=790)|
| 0:13:18| ongoing uses of a specific property, whereas the land use classification reflects the future vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| of land use that's preferred for that property or general area. So, conflicts are common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=805)|
| 0:13:35| You know, any rezoning brought forth by a property owner must comply with the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| and the sector plan land use classifications. So, if a conflicting property on this map was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| submitted for a rezoning, that conflict would disappear through the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| That process is already described thoroughly in Chapter 1. Planning is not proposing any broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| governmental rezonings to resolve all of these conflicts. Doing so could result in legal uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=841)|
| 0:14:09| of a property suddenly being made illegal, and we're not proposing that that be done. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| we're recommending removing this chapter to reduce confusion about what these conflicts really mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=857)|
| 0:14:26| And while I'm talking about these conflicts, I will share the online map. So, on that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| webpage I described, there's a web application that includes three maps. The current one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| plan map, which just shows all the different land use categories. Then there's a tab that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| identifies the one-year plan and the sector plan conflicts. And this shows, this isn't very common,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| but there are some areas where the sector plans, the land use classifications are out of alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| with the one-year plan. And just like with the zoning conflicts, this can be updated through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| rezonings and potential plan amendments brought forth by property owners. If there is a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| where a property has two different land use classifications, it really just, any proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=913)|
| 0:15:22| rezoning of that property just has to conform to both plans. So, it's just kind of a more stringent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=922)|
| 0:15:31| review process, if anything. Then the next tab that we mapped was all of the recent one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=931)|
| 0:15:40| plan amendments that occurred in 2023. There were 23 of them. And that was based on rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| requests that didn't align with the one-year plan land use classifications. So, those are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| that are reviewed on a quarterly basis. And our staff only recommend approval if it meets the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| criteria for a one-year plan amendment, such as whether there was a significant change to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| development pattern that wasn't reflected in the plan, or if there's new information or studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| about a property that could justify a land use change. So, only in those circumstances did we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| recommend approval. And that was taken into account in terms of the City Council and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| Planning Commission's approval as well. Let's see. So, those 23 approved amendments that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=982)|
| 0:16:32| described, those are detailed in a chart in Appendix A of the one-year plan. And then this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=992)|
| 0:16:40| last tab shown on the image of one-year plan and zoning conflicts, we are recommending we remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1000)|

| 0:16:58| In terms of the timeline, this is the first community meeting. There will be another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| next Thursday on February 1st. That's an evening one, also on Zoom. It'll be at 6 p.m. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1022)|

| 0:17:31| Building before the Planning Commission. And then there will be two City Council meetings after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| for final adoption of the one-year plan. And that'll be on April 2nd and April 22nd at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1058)|

| 0:18:06| questioning or concerned about in terms of the update. And now I'm happy to take any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1095)|
| 0:18:28| Hi, Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| This is Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Hi, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Hi. I was just wanting to check and see, since Chapter 4 is getting removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| will planning still be tracking the one-year plan and sector plan conflicts with zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| generally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| So, the one-year plan conflicts with the sector plan are mapped. And then if there's ever a desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1132)|
| 0:19:01| for one-year plan and zoning conflicts to be mapped, that's certainly something we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1141)|
| 0:19:11| Yeah, okay. I just wanted to check and make sure that that was still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| something that we could track, even if it's not in that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Yeah, the capability to do so doesn't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| Any other questions or comments or ideas for additional changes that could have been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1171)|
| 0:19:44| I have just a general question. So, the meeting that's on the first 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| it's really just the same thing where you went over just now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Okay. I put them both in my calendar, so I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| I thought it was, but I wanted to just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Yes. I'm just double-checking that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1201)|
| 0:20:13| Yes, 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| But you're welcome to join both because, you know, it might be a different crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Yeah, different questions that bring up different ideas and that sort of thing. So, I probably will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| Okay. Any other questions or concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1229)|
| 0:20:38| Okay. Well, like I said, you're welcome to reach out to me directly if something comes up later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1238)|
| 0:20:49| and there will be another meeting on the first. So, thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Looks great. Thanks, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1259)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Bye-bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240125-one-year-plan?start=1260)|
