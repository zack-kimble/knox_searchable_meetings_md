| 0:01:45| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Nine members of council present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| I think that's all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| We are going to start the evening with a workshop related to minority contracting in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=111)|
| 0:01:59| and we're going to follow, hopefully, the following agenda to accomplish this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| First, we're going to have a brief presentation by Boyce Evans from the City Purchasing Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| that will talk about the city's policies at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| We will have a brief presentation by Jocelyn Hunley, the Title VI coordinator for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| We will have a brief presentation by the Minority Contractors Association, by Zimbabwe Matugu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=142)|
| 0:02:30| Sorry if I mispronounced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| And then we will have council discussion following that, and if there are others who wish to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| then council may choose at that point whether you want to hear from additional speakers or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| So to start it off, Mr. Evans, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| My name is Boyce Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| I live at 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee, and I am the purchasing agent for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| And let me go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| The purpose really right now is to you can read the statement there, but it's really threefold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| We want to explain to you where we stand on reaching our goal of conducting 10% of our business with minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| and women-owned firms combined, describe our efforts to move us forward in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| and then to solicit ideas potentially for further improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| The next slide, page three there, shows you the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| I'll be covering the first half there under purchasing division, and Joshua and I have worked together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| Ms. Hundley will pick up the piece from the community relations office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| Okay, the first slide of substance, if you will, is the one up there entitled situation as of June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| And that shows you where we were at the end of FY10, and I just want to point out a few things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| You can see the, well, great, turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| The middle line there that ends in FY10 is 6.34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| That's representative of the city having done 6.34% of its business with women-owned firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| and that's just a little bit over $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| And that's the highest ever in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| The one that we are particularly concerned about is the minority-owned business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| The bottom line on the graph there, which is only 2.35%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| and that represents $1.8 million at the end of FY10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| And then in reaching the goal, you know, you combine the both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| and that gives you your top line of 8.68%, which is about $6.85 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| I do want to point something out here that's never been brought out in any of the reports that I've given to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| and it's not on the chart there, and that is that we don't take much out of what I'd call the spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| In other words, to get these numbers, in other words, for the minority-owned one, you say 1.8 million divided by some number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| That number in this case was around 78, almost $79 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| And when I say we don't take much out of that, we start off with the city's whole, their whole expenditures, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=323)|
| 0:05:32| We back out payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| We back out benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| We back out, you know, sole source procurements, easements, land acquisitions, things that can't be competed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| What we keep in there, though, I want just to let you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| is a lot of things, frankly, that a lot of my contemporaries and other agencies take out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| And that is things like banking services from these large banks that we do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| We have to do business with large ones because they're the only ones capable to conduct the type of transactions that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| and the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| We also keep in there insurance, like with Blue Cross Blue Shield Tennessee and those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| There's a lot of other entities out there that take those out because they say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| there's no woman-owned firm in this area that could offer these type services or no minority-owned firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| Our philosophy has been that may be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| but there never will be unless people focus on that and keep that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| So I do want to put that out there to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| So, you know, our numbers could possibly be considerably higher if we had those in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| or had those out of the denominator, but we keep them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| The other thing I wanted to let you know is I just took a peek at the mid-year of FY11 report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| and frankly, the news is not all that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| I mean, the economy has taken its toll, I guess is the only thing I can say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| At the mid-year report, we're looking at, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| small businesses in general have gone from 15.5 percent this year down to 11.26 percent at the mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=424)|
| 0:07:14| And based on the reading that I do and talking to my contemporaries, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| you've got, well, frankly, you've got a lot of small businesses leaving the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| because they can't withstand the way it's been for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| and they don't have the staying power that a lot of the big ones do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| And you've also got situations where large companies are competing for the smaller projects they did not necessarily put into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=450)|
| 0:07:40| I see that at pre-bids and pre-proposal meetings all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| I don't know, am I supposed to serve when I see a light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| Am I supposed to stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| I'm going to ask counsel if that's how they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Would you like to go ahead and get through your presentation and then take questions, or do you have a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Probably both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Take them now and then toward the end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| I was going to hold off general questions, but on this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| is the pink or woman-owned business line exclusive of minorities or blacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| In other words, whether you're a woman or not, you might be in the minority line itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| if you are a minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| And the women line is only women who are not part of a minority category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| If it is a minority-owned women firm, put it in the minority-owned firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| We do not double count that firm then again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| I was concerned about do the numbers overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| No, we do not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| On the next slide here, this is the first of three slides that talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| and these are the more significant initiatives that we have taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| The next slide will be the ones that we are taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| And then the next one will be future initiatives to increase the amount of business we conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| with disadvantaged business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| The first one there was key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| It was back in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| We put in a section in the Code of Ordinances dealing with disadvantaged business enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| And that had never been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| What did that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| That did things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| First off, it defined what is a minority-owned business, what is a woman-owned business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| what is a small business, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| It required the purchasing division to actively solicit bids, proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| and so forth from disadvantaged businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| It codified the 10 percent goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| It required us to provide you and the mayor and top management at the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| and I think it even goes public at some point, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| how we're doing twice a year now in regard to reaching that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| Things that have not been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| So we felt like that was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| Also, the second bullet there, twice a year we do show the departments how they are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| or not doing, as the case may be, in the operations group meeting with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| and all the senior directors on striving to meet the goal of 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| The intent there, obviously, is to encourage the ones that aren't doing it well to do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| and it has some effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| The last one there is something we've done more recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| and that is we have begun allocating as much as 10 points, 10 out of 100 points to RFPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=625)|
| 0:10:34| and RFQs for prime contractors that have a sound plan for employing small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=634)|
| 0:10:44| as either subcontractors or subconsultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| The sounder your plan, the more business you plan to sub out to those type entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| the more of those 10 points you receive and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| So that is something that we have really recently done, particularly with regard to RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| The next slide here on ongoing slash recent initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| these are things that are going to occur this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| A couple of them we've done in the past, some of them not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| That top one there, that business breakfast, we've held that for two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| We're going to hold it again this June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| And some of you have been, but the ones that haven't, just to give you an idea what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| we go over here to the foundry, and right as the budget is about to be released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| we have the various directors describe to the businesses in this region what projects, what bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| and so forth are coming out, what all they pertain to, in some cases even how much money there might be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=699)|
| 0:11:46| and more importantly, when that is going to come out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| The whole intent is to enable the business community to posture themselves to compete for those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=709)|
| 0:11:59| Yeah, any type of business can show up, but frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| the target audience is your small minority and women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Those are the ones we call up, we invite, we send mail to, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| The next one there is also crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| It's the East Tennessee business matchmaking event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| We've held that in Rothschilds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| It's actually put on by the East Tennessee Purchasing Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| but the city of Knoxville has been a main driver in that for two years running and is this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| In fact, I was the president of ETPA last year, so I definitely got to drive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| What we do is we get all kinds of government entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| We've had the city of Chattanooga there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| We had a pseudo-government, B&W Y-12, Johnson City, all around here with the KCDC, Knoxville, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=763)|
| 0:12:52| We get a lot of private corporations, the large ones, Pilot, Covenant Health, Children's Hospital, UT, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=772)|
| 0:13:01| Anyway, they show up and we match their buying needs over about an 18-month period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| to what the smaller companies have turned into us and said that they provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| Then we set them up throughout the day in a series of 10-minute appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| where they can sit down with the buyers from those entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| and explain what goods and services they have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| It has had as much as 750 to 800 people that attended it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| It's growing each year, and it's because, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| there's some awards of purchase orders and contracts that do come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| It's a good thing, and it doesn't cost those that participate a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| It's paid for by the matchmakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| My point is, though, I probably haven't done enough advertising on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| but the city of Knoxville has been a big driver in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| The other thing we do is Miss Bennett over here to my left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| Sherry, does weekly conduct cold calls to minority-owned and women-owned businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=838)|
| 0:14:07| to tell them what's up for bid, what's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| or something that may be coming up in the future to garner their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| and hopefully get them to turn in a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| I asked her the other day, hey, how many have we done in a while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| And she handed me a stack of papers like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Each of these pages consists of an individual call, usually four calls to a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| She does that all day, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| We do not do that for the businesses that look like me, male, white, Caucasian-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| We do that for the minority-owned and the women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| We also distribute that list of disadvantaged business enterprises to the various departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| so that they can use those when they have small purchases to make, i.e., under $5,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=891)|
| 0:15:00| And that's crucial so that they know who they can go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| The last one there is something that this body recently voted on and truly appreciated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| and that is when we move the threshold from $4,000 to $5,000 on the for small purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=913)|
| 0:15:24| and from $10,000 to $25,000 for the competitive bid threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=924)|
| 0:15:34| And, yes, sir, you're right, I see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| I'm just not used to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Mr. DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| I think he's getting to the point I was curious about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| and that is we're trying to make it less onerous for small contracts for people to bid on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| without going through a lot of really heavy-duty kind of bid analysis, bid work that they might have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| And let me just, thanks for, that is what I'm getting to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| And I just wanted to, using the old data, you remember where $4,000 was the small purchase threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| You can find the numbers from FY10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Twenty-seven percent of the business under $4,000 went to small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| Now, when you upped it to between $4,000 and $10,000 where we were required to get three quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| it drops to 19% of those were small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| The larger purchases that required competitive sealed bids, $10,000 and above, it drops to less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=988)|
| 0:16:36| So right there, 27%, 19%, less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| What that tells me, I mean, is that the less you have to go through, like you just said, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| the procurement process, you know, bids and bonds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| Frankly, the better small businesses do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| And the reason it's important, we're talking minority-owned firms to a large extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| The reason small businesses are important is 89% of the minority-owned firms that conduct business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1025)|
| 0:17:14| with the City of Knoxville are also in the small business category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| So when you're getting to small businesses, you're getting to minority-owned firms in large measure, almost 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| Additionally, women-owned businesses that have registered to conduct business with the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| 66% of those also fall into the small business category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| So when you're talking small business, we're talking minority and women-owned firms in large measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| So I think adjusting of those procurement thresholds, not only increasing the effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| and efficiency of the purchasing division and getting stuff to the departments quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| but it helps the small business community to include minority and women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| I was just picturing large corporations that have two or three people maybe that do nothing but manage bids and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| If you're a small business, you're a hands-on kind of guy that's doing a little paperwork on the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| and you don't have a team to just fill out all that paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| It takes a long time to, I mean, you've got to sit down and figure out a lot of different things before you can turn in a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1091)|
| 0:18:20| If you're going to be competitive and also make money, walk that fine line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| It will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| On the next slide there, future initiatives, these are some things that we are working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| The first one is something I've got right in my inbox and I am pushing to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| and I'll get it done shortly, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| And that is to set some citywide goals for small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| And I want to bring back some recommendations to the Equal Business Opportunity Program Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| and Josh will talk more about them in a minute so that we can come up with some goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| and, you know, get them to the mayor and so forth for what we really ought to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| And then once we set those, then we can move to the next bullet there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| setting some specific departmental goals for, you know, small, minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| and women-owned business for the, instead of just saying 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| In other words, 10% may make good sense to, like, I don't know, the public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| but it may not make any sense to parks and rec, which traditionally does much higher than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| And then you may have engineering when they get into professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| and frankly there's just not that many, for instance, minority-owned professional service companies around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| If there are, I need to have them pointed out to me because we're not finding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| There's just not that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| So 10% to them is meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| They're never going to get there, at least not in the short run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| So we need to tailor those goals to something that is reasonable, feasible, and achievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| The last one there is of great interest to us, and I don't think you've been told about this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| And that is we, about a month ago, put out a request for proposals to get a contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1202)|
| 0:20:10| or, excuse me, a consultant to help us increase the amount of bids, proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| and statements of qualifications that we get from the minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| And the reason we did that is, frankly, they're just not competing to the extent that we would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1222)|
| 0:20:30| In FY10, this past FY, out of 603 bids, proposals, statements of qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| only 41 of them came from the minority-owned firms, 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| And that's 6.8% of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| We're never going to get to 10% if we can't up the amount of competition that we get from that sector of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| So what we're wanting to do, and what we've written the RFP to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| is get a consultant to assist us in determining why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| You know, why is it that we're not getting the bids and proposals from that sector of the business community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| And then to develop an action plan based on whatever that rationale is to help us do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1272)|
| 0:21:21| And if everything is still tracking, in other words, we believe, yes, they have unearthed the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| and yes, they have a sound action plan to assist the city then, either in whole or in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| in implementing that action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Bottom line, we want to have more proposals and bids from the minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| And making cold calls and the outreach efforts and so forth that we do, well, frankly, we're doing a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| It's not having the effect that we'd like it to with that section of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Now, I will tell you one disclaimer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| That is not fully funded at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| The evaluation committee is going to have to look at it and see is there truly value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| In other words, out of the proposals that we received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| are there some proposals here that would probably, based on their qualifications, experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| and plan going to get us to where we need to be or where we would like to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| If there are, Mr. York and Mr. Martin, I'll go back to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| and they're fully aware of what we're doing here and we're going to try to get some money to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| But it is not allocated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| You won't find a budget line for it is where I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| The last slide I'm going to leave you with before I move on and turn it over to Jocelyn is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1360)|
| 0:22:48| we're not where we want to be, but I just wanted to give you an idea of how we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| anyway, the University of Tennessee, their master's degree program, MBA students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| stacked us up after looking at a whole lot of different cities and different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| And as you can see, like I say, we're not where we need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| but we're not all that bad either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Just kind of food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| I do want to leave you with this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| The reason you see places like Lexington, Little Rock, and Roanoke on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| we had to go out of the state is because, much to my surprise at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| most of the cities and the counties in this state do not even track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| I'm talking about bigger places, too, Johnson City, Chattanooga, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| And a lot of the counties all over the place just don't track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Frankly, in most cases, they're not staffed to track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I've got a small business specialist, Sherry, that works in purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| and works hard on track of that, so at least we know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| But, you know, if you don't have somebody that's dedicated to looking at that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| you really can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| So I'm not slamming them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| I just want to let you know that, yeah, we're not where we want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| but when you stack it up, we're not all that terrible either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| And I guess with that, yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Mr. Delarope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Before you leave, that category that has the X in it, sliding scale RFP points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| that's not singing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| What is that talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| I guess it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| I should have spoke to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| A sliding scale is if you have a discount for, let's say if we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1468)|
| 0:24:38| Nashville is the only one I know of in the state of Tennessee that has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| Nashville or Metropolitan, Davidson County, whatever it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Your up to 10 points thing you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| It is hell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| I made a copy of it in the back of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| It's going to take forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| I made a copy of theirs at one time because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Can you hit the full size so I can see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| In this instance, if there is a bid out there or something they're buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1517)|
| 0:25:25| look all the way to the top of the chart up there that is between zero and $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| If, as I understand it, you are a small business that has to be race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| and gender neutral in Davidson County, then you would get a 15% discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| In other words, if you bid $100 for whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| you would be evaluated as if you had only bid $85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| Now, you would get paid $100 because that was what you wrote down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| but you would be evaluated because you were small and in Davidson County at $85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| And then, as you can see, the scale, the percent of the discount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| decreases as the price range goes up to finally a million dollars or above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| There is no discount because it's cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| So that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| They had credit against their bid for being a small business in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| In that county, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Penny, if you can take me back to where I was, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| And the only reason Nashville did real good there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| they're the only ones, to my knowledge anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| and to UT's at that time in the state that had something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| The other piece there we have implemented since that UT study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| is allocating points in the RFP process for if the prime has a sound plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| for bringing in small businesses as consultants or subcontractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| So I would, you know, I think if they were to do it over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| we'd probably get a check there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| We've implemented one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| We hadn't implemented the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| And I'll just tell you, my thoughts on that, since we're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| is something like that is probably premature at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| that sliding scale, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| because we don't have enough data from minority-owned business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| to know whether there is truly a disparity between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| in other words, if I'm a minority-owned firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| what percent chance do I have of winning a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| as opposed to if I'm a women-owned firm and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| We don't have enough data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| We don't know if it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| And there would be costs associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| and a whole lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| It's a little premature before we even really seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| consider something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| If I could ask you one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| You mentioned a consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| and you were wondering if that was going to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| I have no idea what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| but it sounds like $20,000 or $30,000 minimum, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| to get someone on board to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| What about sort of roundtables where you invite minority businesses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| and say, hey, why aren't you all bidding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Tell us what are the obstacles you're running into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I mean, how about a kind of a get-together that gets right to the source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| and asks those kinds of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| Maybe set up a coffee and Danish hour once a month or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| I'll just be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Some folks from the Equal Business Opportunity Program Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and I and Jocelyn kind of talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| And frankly, I don't know that we'd get a good candid answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| because when people are looking at me or they're looking at Sherry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| or they're looking at Jocelyn, they see the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| We're spokespersons for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| And so, you know, your sincerity is brought into question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| particularly if you're somebody that doesn't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| if you're in that category of I don't want to do business with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| and they've already got their minds made up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| you know, if that was a perception or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| One outsider produces candor, if that's what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Well, one of the – no, that's not what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| In fact, one of the – I think 15 of the evaluation points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| in that particular RFP was going to be that you have already got solid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| well-established relations in the Knoxville minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| It would need to be somebody that was respected within that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| Mr. Woodhall has been waiting patiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| But an outside consultant would produce candor because they're, as you just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| I mean, they're going to sit in a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| and some of the minority business owners are not going to say directly to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| perhaps, some things that we need to hear because they don't want to offend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| It might seem too challenging, but it's something we definitely want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| because those businesses may be entertaining –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| you may be entertaining bids from them, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| I mean, that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| I think you're true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| The only – I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| The only thing I can bring it back –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I just – looking at that chart reminded me when the UT students were going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| and one of the things they looked at is how well we were doing internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| So they started talking to the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Well, they got a whole different position from the department directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| on how we were doing than when I would go and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| That's just the way people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Every now and then somebody might tell you the unvarnished truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| That's usually somebody you don't want to talk to all that often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| I appreciate your interest in an outside consultant to try to get it to the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| of what are some of these environmental challenges that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| When we're talking about small business, what do we mean by that term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| I mean, is it a certain number of employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| You know, I think – I thought I had everything with me in backup, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| It is stratified by there's a certain amount of employees that you can't go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| There's a certain amount of gross revenue or sales that you can't bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| You know, there's thresholds in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| Those are two of the areas, and they're broken out by type of industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| For instance, the construction industry, you know, you're probably going to bring in a whole lot more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| than maybe, you know, a small mom and pop – you know, a retail type situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| To get my brain around it, would you say anything underneath 100 employees would be small business or 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| I wish I had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| I just – how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| I think it's smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| That's one of the things we've also been looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Now that you mentioned it, is Mr. Martin, the boss, is – you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| when he first looked at our definition, he told me, he said, hey, Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| I think it's probably a little too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And sure enough, we compared it against the – like, I think it's the Small Business Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| what they have as it, and we were smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| We probably need to expand the definition somewhat so it's in a more accepted realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| We've got some work to do in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| But suffice to say, it is – you know, how many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| How much gross revenue do you bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| There's one other category, and I can't think of it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you, Mr. Evans, for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I want to ask you, when you do the cold calls and you have the breakfast, the invitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| and people that you call, where do you get – is that list updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| How do you know who to call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| And is that list updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Ms. Bennett does update that list constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| We send it out about twice a year to the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| It's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| In other words, somebody's always going out of business or coming in that we didn't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| And she'll usually highlight the businesses that are new on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| I guess what I'd say is we do our best to keep it updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| Are there errors in it from time to time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| And the information you have, is this specific to Knoxville only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| or do you include surrounding areas as far as minority businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| We go to Knox and I guess I'd call it the ten surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| That's really what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| In other words, we're not looking necessarily at, I don't know, Atlanta or Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| or someplace, you know, pretty far away from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Did I miss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Do you all utilize the state's list of minority vendors as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| Because they have a very comprehensive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| On some of our purchases, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| When we have a pretty good list of local businesses, then I try to utilize as much as possible our local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| But if it's not a very good list, then I will go to the state's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2045)|
| 0:34:14| and look at their list of small businesses or minority and women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Professional services definitely might fall in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| We really struggle in that area around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| It's just a good resource, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I'm wondering if it's the same thing with like the lab in Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| and the DOE's office, their small disadvantaged business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Do you ever talk to those folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| Trevor, some of those folks down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Because I would assume one of the problems is when you have an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| you really don't have the small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| Locally, they don't offer those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| So you have an opportunity, but you don't see a local company that provides those services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| and that's probably the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| If I could shift the response from Ms. Bennett to Ms. Owens for a second here, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| We hijacked her from the ORNL, and she's helped us in that endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| We know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Just so we can keep the record correct, if you don't mind, when you join in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| would you please state your name first and your position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| I'm Penny Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| I'm the contract manager in purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| And, yes, especially with the lab, being a former employee there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I have a lot of people that I can talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| And with the matchmaking event specifically, that was one which I've been really involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| So we went to them to get their small business list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| and we've contacted them to get lists of small businesses from them on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| Are there any other questions at this point for Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| I was just noticing the comparisons of Nashville, which, of course, has three goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| or two goods and three excellents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| I don't know exactly, of course, how the criteria was arrived at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| but would you have any idea of why Nashville is rated so highly or what they're doing that we're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| I think on the ‑‑ I've spoken to the sliding scale, but also the interactive website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| I believe they have a system in place, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| that through e‑mail automatically notifies businesses of when a certain bid comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| where they have products and services that they offer that fall into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2192)|
| 0:36:40| We are working on such a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| We've got the first step done, which is you can register to do business with the city online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| but we have not got the piece implemented so that it generates the automatic e‑mails yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| That's supposed to be by this summer sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| That will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| That's one of the ongoing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Frankly, that will help us a whole lot, particularly in terms of the cold calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| That will free Sherry up, in other words, to make some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| but to do a lot of other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| We're anxious to get that going full bore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| So the MBA students determined that these five tools are the key tools for accomplishing the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| They're pretty fundamental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| That was their ‑‑ it was that entrepreneurial business aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| the program they've got over there run by Mr. Swift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| They really had a good team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| They did a thorough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| We're still going to explore maybe there are other tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I just threw this up here as a means of just kind of a snapshot in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| a little bit dated, but, you know, because I'll be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| I mean, going back here, you know, when I look at that bottom line right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| 2.35 percent, I'm not happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I don't like it, and I want to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| And so that's the bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| But what I wanted to tell you was this bad news that that is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| comparatively speaking, we're not bringing up the rear of the formation either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| You're talking about Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Would they send like an alert blast that we're having a bid next week that's set aside for small contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| or that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Is that what they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| They're blasting out to recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Is that on the radar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| It works like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| When you register in one of these municipalities with them that have this type of database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| let's say I sell, I don't know, I've got architectural engineering services, and I get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| Well, when the purchasing division finally gets through an RFQ or a letter of interest that's going to go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| when that thing gets posted to their normal website or in paper or whatever else they do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| also their system automatically generates e-mails to all those people who filled out that they provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| architectural engineering services, and they get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| And that's real important for small businesses because of wake-up call here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| There's one right on the radar, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Correct, because the small businesses, generally speaking, don't have people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| They're not staffed to go to all these websites and look for that like the larger corporations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| You know, I mean, when we have a big project out there, you know, multi-million dollar project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| and we get calls from, you know, San Diego, Honolulu, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| it's just from people looking at the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| But your small businesses, you know, they could be right here in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| and unless we call them, they're not going to know about it or unless they read it in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| Councilman Warhol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| One quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Let's say you get the consultant, and that consultant comes to you and says, Mr. Evans, you're doing a terrific job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| It just so happens, though, that you have a community that is not real friendly to people who are not white males.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| What are you going to say to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| Develop the action plan to deal with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| That's my next response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Identify the problem, or the situation, and then identify the action plan to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| That's what you're being paid to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Mr. Evans, you have an approved vendors list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Can a company apply to become an approved vendor and then, therefore, see requests when they come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2447)|
| 0:40:56| No, they will not automatically see requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Whether you are or let's just take one, one that's got, I was talking architectural engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| Vaughn & Melton obviously has got quite a few because they do good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| But we don't call up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Vaughn & Melton and tell them or anything like that, even though they are a vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| I don't know that we have approved vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| We have vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| You take Oak Ridge or TVA or I'm sure the state of Tennessee, the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| When they have an RFP that goes out, they send that to companies, especially small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| and disadvantaged businesses, and through a disadvantaged business office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| they'll go out to those contractors and say, we have a scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| And then they respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| They say, hey, we want to go after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| And then they respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| And, you know, I'm just, when you say you look at that chart and you say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| you're not happy with two and a half percent, I'm just wondering if you've come to any conclusion why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2520)|
| 0:42:08| Because I've got some real ideas why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| I think it goes back to not receiving in the number of bids and proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| and so forth that we would like to from that sector of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| I mean, if we're not getting the bids and proposals in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| then we're never going to be able to do the amount of business that we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| with a minority-owned business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I mean, that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Now, why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| I've got my own ideas on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| I can speculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| I mean, if you ask me, I would say, you know, I've heard this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| There's a perception out there that, well, the city knows who they want to do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| There's no sense even trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Nothing could be further from the truth, but that is a perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Then there's also the perception of, well, government's too big for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| There's no sense in even fooling with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Again, wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| You know, but I would like to get somebody to get us a better opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| You know, again, I'm just speculating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Worth what you just paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| I'd like to get somebody in here that would be able to get that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Because we, you know, we've been down this path since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| You know, when 203 or whatever we started, the Haslam administration initiated this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| And, you know, when you see 2.35, you know, we're not getting anywhere with it, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| And I'm just trying to figure out, like, with the ESCO contract, Amoresco won it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| I wonder what the minority participation is in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| Because I'm aware of a lot of companies that do that type of work around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| Amoresco, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but they have done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| Do you remember what they were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I mean, is it close to 10 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| It is close to 10 percent, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| We had long talks with them before they ever came on board and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| you will do your best in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| Obviously, don't, you know, go to the poorhouse because you're trying to meet the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| But give us your best effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| But when we do have a large contract, that's an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| Because those companies can go out and actively pursue small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| And we make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| We do make that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Further questions for Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Seeing none, thank you very much, Mr. Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2668)|
| 0:44:28| And we'll go now to the Title VI coordinator, Jocelyn Hundley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2668)|
| 0:44:37| I'm supposed to state my name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Jocelyn Hundley, 6109 Rivers Run Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2680)|
| 0:44:51| Monitoring and evaluation of the report that is submitted by the purchasing department is driven by the Title VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| EBOP coordinator, which is me, and I answer to the community relations director, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| The EBOP is a remedial action program of Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| And just for your refresher course, Title VI is a civil rights act of 1964 that states that no person shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| discriminated on the grounds of race, color, national origin, or be excluded from participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| or be denied benefits of or subjected to any discrimination whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2722)|
| 0:45:31| The Equal Business Opportunity Program actually was created in 1999 by executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| And there are five components to this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| Today I will briefly explain each area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2745)|
| 0:45:54| There were several resources utilized to create this program and to list a few influential references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| These here listed are not, this is only a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| Several programs and documents will be viewed to assist in the creation of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| The EBOP has only had two employees, and I am the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| The program utilizes the Equal Business Opportunity Program Advisory Committee to the greatest extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| And I believe one of the council persons mentioned having a panel of minority input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| These panels provide us with first-hand knowledge of existing business constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| candid complaints and suggestions, heartfelt concerns, and some innovative ideas on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| They come before us and assist us in ensuring that we can continue to provide open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| and transparent government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| We appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| Creation of the Minority Women's Small Business Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| As you can see, in this particular program, we wanted to make sure that each contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| request for proposal, request for qualification, encouraging partnership and joint ventures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| was a significant piece of this particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| We did our best to ensure that that happened by making sure that all our contracts include a good-faith inclusion plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| and that all our RFPs and qualifications do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| We also include in these particular contracts specific forms for our contractors to comply with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| and they're held accountable, and these are sometimes turned around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| turned away because they have not submitted this particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| The certification component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| The certification component, as you see, we do it once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| Anyone can apply for this particular certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| There is a certification directory that is accessible via our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| If you go to our website, you can actually view this certified directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| There's also a small business directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| This is a voluntary directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Some vendors don't want to be included for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Nonetheless, it's open to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| If you go to the certified directory, you will get an actual one-page statement of qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| on that particular city certified in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| Now, some of our vendors are certified by other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| GDOT, Governor's Office of Diversity, Women's Business Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| So some of them have several types of certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| This particular directory just serves certified businesses that the city has done, just the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2927)|
| 0:48:58| Boyce mentioned our numerical goals, and I see you guys have vetted this pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| so I'll just sort of briefly go through this particular slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| As he stated, he is actually adding an additional reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| including the purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| is that adds additional reporting to go along with our annual reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| that is requested of the Equal Business Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| We make sure that each one of our reports that is submitted and placed on the website is submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| is separate from small business enterprises, is recorded separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| and the breakdown is by gender and race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| You'll be able to look at it and get through each one of the you can actually look at each category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| and get the general information as it pertains to each business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| Before we go on, Jocelyn, on the certification you were talking about, I'm still puzzling over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| does a business go in and get certified that they qualify as a small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| or a woman-owned business or a minority-owned business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| so that they then get the notices, the phone calls, whatever contact approaches we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3006)|
| 0:50:16| or that they're shown that they already qualify for the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| What does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| What does the certification do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| The certification component was to basically provide verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| that the individual is actually 51 percent owned and operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| and the city has actually vetted the business's information and data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| and provide that clarification and verification that that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| that they are 51 percent owned either by women or by minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| and that in order to get that information, with the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| you do not have to be certified to receive business from the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| You can fill out a vendor application and get the cold calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| and get the information just as well as these particular individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| With this, you actually get our website publicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| If someone's calling trying to get verification of where exactly can I find a listing of certified vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| that would be my first spot to send them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| So a general contractor might go to your certification list to get subs that they could use on a project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Also, as I mentioned...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| It's a referral of business in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| As I mentioned also, there's a small business directory on there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| and those individuals are not certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| They just wanted to have the information submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| The certification directory goes a little bit more in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| If you click on their particular business, you'll get a full statement of qualifications on what their references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| and things of that nature, a one-pager for that particular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| It's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| And some businesses just elect not to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| These forms are accessible via our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Or I can mail them either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| How do you verify that certification to make sure that these businesses that are claiming to be minority-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| businesses, how is that verified anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| The certification process consists of several different eight items if they're asked to submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| One is they're asked to actually submit their bylaws or charters, their organizational chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| Some financials is also requested as well as business licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| And their particular package, that information has to prove that they are the ones that actually can run this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3159)|
| 0:52:47| if employees actually leave or if something happens to where they are the only one responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| They're going to be the only ones there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| So this particular set of documentation is what we ask of them to provide that verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| And we do call or I do call and verify based on what they've submitted, the references as well as the verifiables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3183)|
| 0:53:12| because they give me permission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| No more questions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Our ongoing outreach efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| We have a lengthy ongoing outreach efforts here from the Equal Business Opportunity Program as well as from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| Purchasing Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| And some of them are done in collaborative efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| And some of these are initiated by the EBLP and actually carried out by just the Equal Business Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| And here are just a few of those that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| Boyce mentioned our city business opportunity event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3243)|
| 0:54:11| He actually undercounted how many times we've done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| We've actually been doing this almost for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| We initiated this back in 2007, had some great sponsors, and still continue to have a good turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| We've been at it for a long time, right, Boyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Annual reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| This annual report that I am referring to here is part of the executive order for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| When the office was established, it was stated that this particular office would submit an annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| Now, this is what we put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| What Boyce is putting out is an addition, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| So you're getting additional information and you're getting it more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| So that keeps us abreast of where we are and engaging us, how we're going to look at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| You can actually access an abridged version of the EBLP report, which is basically the city information that Boyce puts out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| and an overview of some of the things that we do from the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| You should be able to access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| And actually, you should be able to go with our NAMs and view the one we had, our report from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| In the report, the actual manual full report, you actually have KUB, KCDC, and CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| and their report information listed as well, how well they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| and just getting an idea of the different types of things that they're doing to make things happen in their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3328)|
| 0:55:37| Technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| That was another component of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| And in our technical assistance program, some of you may have attended some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| Some of you may have heard of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| What we do is some serious outreach through purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| and making sure people are aware of our technical assistance workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| And here are some of the topics that we've covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| We've had, as presenters, we've had some tremendous presenters abroad that reached a broad audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| We had the former mayor of Augusta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| We've had HUD's small business acting director for the small business utilization program here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| We did well with attracting individuals to this small business conference that we usually hold in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| This is different than what we do, I'm sorry, that we hold in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| This is different than what we do in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| This provides the technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| It directs resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| It provides free bidding and estimating ideals and concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3394)|
| 0:56:42| an opportunity to actually come before and listen to the region and access a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| We've also been able to live stream some of our actual technical assistance through VIA Web,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| through the Pellissippi State on Magnolia Campus efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| They've helped us live stream some of these particular workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| We do have a mentor-protege program as part of one of our technical assistance pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| It was established in 2000, and the first session began in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| They completed it in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| As far as the three, they were actually from the construction field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Three mentors were from the construction field, and the three protegees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Two were general contractors, and one was an electrician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| After reviewing our mentor-protege program, we came to the conclusion that we needed to provide a more intimate one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| to allow them to be able to actually open their books and be as vulnerable as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3458)|
| 0:57:46| And SCORE has been able to provide them an array of technical assistance to our incoming protegees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3466)|
| 0:57:55| Accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| I only listed a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| There are several small ones, but here are some of the larger ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| or the primary ones that I wanted to put up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| We established a goal setting with TDOT on TDOT projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| We do that as TDOT projects are assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| Let me hold you up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Jocelyn, I was wondering, do you work with the Chamber at all that they have some kind of a mentoring of small businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| And I didn't know if they went out and worked with minority contractors through your suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| or otherwise to help them get ready to get the contracts, to succeed in bidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| to be picked as a subcontractor of a general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| I mean, is there some cross-pollination through the Chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| When the Chamber first began their program there, they came to the city and sat down with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| and actually visited with us on a couple of our Equal Business Opportunity Program meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| and pulled our model, so to speak, to derive what they have come to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| And, yes, definitely we have talked about, as our proteges leave our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| that they would be actually guided toward the Chamber because at that point they've already had opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| to get the technical piece under wraps and their weaknesses strengthened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| and be in a better position to be able to be served by the mentors from the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Another thing is one of the accomplishments were that on our Form 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| and Form 2 that third bullet is referring to the actual language that I mentioned at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| It is referring to making sure that the individual contractors are submitting this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| and we're going back and doing heightened monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| and our evaluation of what they're actually submitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| And most of you are aware of the East Knoxville Professional Business Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| that they're up and running and their momentum, they have great momentum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| and they are steadily progressing right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| That was an initiation with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| and facilitated actually from our office and collaboration with a couple of other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| with the Urban League, SunTrust Bank, and the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| And these are our basic focal points for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| There are several more, but here are some of the ones that we feel that would be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| in assisting the Purchasing Department in pushing us closer to our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3629)|
| 1:00:41| One of the focal points that I did not place up there is that on a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| sometimes on a request basis and sometimes I initiate these particular projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| when funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| We work with PBA on the CAF projects and we have specific breakfasts and receptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| in order to attract, to call in minority and women-owned business on this specific project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| to actually discuss all the ins and outs of that particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| and they have a special invitation and announcement and they're asked to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| So it's project specific as well if we get the cooperation from the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| And PBA has been great with working with us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| So we did two for the CAF project and we assisted with the lead information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| We provided a resource, a resource for attracting businesses for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| And in conclusion, since the creation of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| we've established a professional relationship across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| with various managers of programs similar to ours in an effort to draw their best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| from their best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Knoxville does have the oldest program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Nonetheless, we definitely can always learn from others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| The Equal Business Opportunity Program has become extremely visible over the past five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| and certainly hope that we can become more effective just as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| Thank you, Ms. Hunley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Mr. DelVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| I wonder, Jocelyn, if you have looked into that Nashville software or whatever they're doing to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| out how they're doing that contractor alerts when there are bids that fit their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| their job type or skill set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| So if you're an architect, you get the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Or if you're a building contractor, you get the notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Have you looked into that piece of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| That would be a purchasing piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| And I haven't looked into making that particular piece happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| but I've talked with the Small Business Development Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Business Office of Assistance Manager on how well it operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| and how well it folks helps them to notify their small business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| I could actually defer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Purchasing, because they're working with our IS department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| and we have an ISupplier model that we're developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| and it's going to do some of those similar things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| I'm not exactly sure exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| It's going to do that exact thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| It is called ISupplier, Jocelyn's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| and it should be effective sometime this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| hopefully earlier in the summer rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| I'd like to be able to go to that business breakfast sometime in early June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| and say this is out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| So this summer, sir, that we'll be able to do the same thing they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| And from your perspective, Jocelyn, if I could ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| What do you see the reluctance from the minority community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| or the women-owned business community to be more, you know, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| More aggressive in going after bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| Is there something we're doing wrong that's holding folks back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| I mean, is there a perception that why bother, you're not going to get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| I mean, what are you seeing out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Well, I'm relying upon several different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| and I'm speculating as much as Boise is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| I'm listening to the Equal Business Opportunity Program Advisory Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| and our whole thing is that's what that RFP is going to try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| What are we not doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Look at us internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Look at us externally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| Is it because our bonding is too high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Is it because our insurance is different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| What is it that is keeping you from actually following through with the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| Is the technical assistance missing your mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| What exactly is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| I mean, for one example, I mean, do we have too much annoying paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| so that you'd rather do business somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| I mean, is there something that you're seeing that holds people back from going after the jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| For those who actually go through the process and bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| we have several testimonials that actually have presented at some of our workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| It goes just like I can just refer to what Boise was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| One will say there's too much trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| You've already got a set of contractors in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| While the others say, you know, I came to this business breakfast and I stuck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| I was consistent and now I've got a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| So it's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| It's all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Well, we had heard someone say one time that Oak Ridge has set-asides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| and it's easier to get a contract as a minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| And so why bother with the city when you can go there and get a set-aside contract or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| I'm just curious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Well, my experience in speaking with the Small Business Development Office program managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3913)|
| 1:05:21| and with the Department of Energy program managers, I asked them the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| And they responded with, well, most of them are not even local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Most of the people that get the contracts are not local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| They're more regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| So they were unable to give me numbers, but that was their speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| Other questions for Ms. Hundley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| Seeing none, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3944)|

| 1:06:36| I'm listening to a presentation that we heard time and time again in the early 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=3996)|

| 1:07:00| primarily African-American firms, other minorities, and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| Blaming the victim is the easiest scapegoat going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4027)|
| 1:07:17| The Black Business Contractors Association, and I hope indeed you did get the information that I left for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| Did you indeed get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| Could you pull the mic closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4049)|

| 1:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| With that information, I hope you are at least familiar somewhat with our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| Nashville was looked at and applauded, but Nashville did not initiate this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4062)|
| 1:07:51| this extraordinary effort toward including the excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4071)|

| 1:08:32| You applaud Nashville, that's good, because they obviously had the energy, the concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| and I guess in some ways the empathy to do what was necessary to bring about some achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4119)|
| 1:08:48| This effort started not with Haslam, but with Victor Ashe and Schumper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4128)|
| 1:09:03| I intended to speak to and disagree with an earlier position taken by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4143)|
| 1:09:16| it seemed, the Purchasing Department and the Title VI office that was reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4156)|
| 1:09:24| in their earlier news release stating that things were going along pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4164)|
| 1:09:32| as it pertained to expenditures to African American and other minority firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| But I then learned from the release of the RFP that they had finally acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4179)|
| 1:09:47| how devastating this process had been to African American firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4187)|
| 1:09:59| So as a consequence, I don't have to convince you that the condition is desperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| They have acknowledged that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| It is a desperate condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| Businesses are disappearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| And we must take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| The action plan does not have to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| It is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| The city of Knoxville paid for a disparity study that has clearly outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| and depicted procedures that can be taken in order to resolve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4237)|
| 1:10:48| Our position is that the RFP went out prematurely if it was to go out at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4248)|
| 1:11:02| That the RFP probably was in reaction to us finally getting a hearing here before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4262)|
| 1:11:15| With that in mind, we know in fact that in order to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4275)|
| 1:11:28| the most recent data has to be acquired as it pertained to the targeted groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4288)|
| 1:11:38| There certainly should be a provision in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| We need to look at, after 11 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| how much change has taken place as it pertains to women businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| African-American businesses, and other minority groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4318)|
| 1:12:15| Consequently, we're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4335)|
| 1:12:23| Withdraw and amend the minority-owned business assistance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4343)|
| 1:12:32| see them not to request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| That's the proposal. The RFP is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Specific information contained in the disparity study needs updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4360)|
| 1:12:49| Document the current number of minority and female businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| and any increase, decrease in number respectively since the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4374)|
| 1:13:03| Two, reconfigure the Title VI office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| that is the Equal Business Opportunity Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| And three, charge the Black Business Contractors Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| Zimbabwe as its president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| and the City of Knoxville Office of Purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| Orris Evans as director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| with submitting for approval to Mayor Daniel T. Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| and the Knoxville City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| a revised policy and goals for the minority contracting program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| that incorporates both race-neutral and race-conscious recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| This charge shall be submitted no longer than 30 days after it's assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| Let me reiterate with utmost emphasis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| it is almost redundant and in many instances superfluous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4444)|
| 1:14:11| to have a consultant come in and repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| the thorough job that has already been paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| in the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| What we need is already contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| and is sitting on some desk in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| We need to distill, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| what is asked for in the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| However, I concede and I recommend that before that is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| that Boaz and I get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| and proceed as reflected in these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| I concede also that in order for us to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| with some muscularity, to give parity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| to women, African-American and other minority businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| we have to prepare ourselves for any challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| that may come from that good old boy network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| That's why the update is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| because it has proven that most challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| even those that have not been won,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| have been based on what they have charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| as being antiquated data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| and the disparity study now is a decade old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| So the RFP, as I see it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| should focus on updating information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| on women and minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| So as we proceed with sincerity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| and as we accelerate an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| to recompense those folk who have been excluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| we will be defended properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| against any possible challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| that may come from those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| who have gotten used to the orthodoxy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| An orthodoxy that has left out continuously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| a significant group in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| Let me share with you these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4592)|
| 1:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| If there are those who want to sign up for the public forum session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| if you would come down to the desk over here, you could sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| I thought I'd get that in while we were passing those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| Zimbabwe, could you tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I heard what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| I'm not sure I've digested it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| Do you think that black and minority women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| minority contractors are not bidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| are not being selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| are being discouraged from bidding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| I mean, what do you think is happening out there on a practical level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| I mean, I've heard the theoretical argument you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| but on a practical level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| why aren't either more contractors coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| or we're not picking more contractors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| What do you see happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| I think some elements of all of the above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| some element of all of the above is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| However, I think we're missing the boat by focus on that primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4689)|
| 1:18:16| I think we need to give primacy to historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| how do we get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| where folk who have a passion for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| and who've invested time and money into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| have given up on trying to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| from one of the greatest resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| in the city and in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| I think if Pablo's dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| instead of getting a sugar treat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| had gotten a bitter pill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| the mutt would have stopped going to the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| He would have stopped ringing the bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| You're saying people are discouraged from going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| because they haven't gotten contracts in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| I think the reason why certain folk are reluctant to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| The reason why some of certain folk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4753)|
| 1:19:22| even today, are reluctant to donate organs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| is because of the residuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| of the Tuskegee Institute experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| I think that tradition leaves an inertia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| that we cannot ignore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| and simply discard with spurious arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| of they're not actively pursuing contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| That is too mundane and insensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| It is insensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| It's the reason they're not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| is because they don't want to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| If they wanted to work, they could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| I cannot overemphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| what is already available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| that is contained in the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| The disparity study outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| what they call non-racial procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| and what they call racial procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| What that is, you have race-neutral things you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| and you have things that are race-conscious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I think that when Quinn and I get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| we're going to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| with some kind of combination of the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| that I hope you guys will accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| so we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Again, I think that it is absolutely redundant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| to put a lot of time and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| into additional research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| That is not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| We know that we have folk interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| in doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| and we know from the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| that that business is not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| What Title VI does, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| which is the biggest portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| I think the most dynamic portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Title VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Title VI is supposed to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| They gave it more potency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| as the years went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| It's supposed to be not only reactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| it's supposed to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| It emphasizes being proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| Come up with ways to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| and make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| to rectify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| to make this part of the society whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Don't just sit back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| well, they're not coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| and we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| You're supposed to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| analyze it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| come up with various ways to correct it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| and it tells you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| that the concern no longer will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| whether or not your intention is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| to discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| It took that off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| which kept a whole lot of blisters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| from being formed through argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| It said, we'll just look at the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Just look at the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| After five, six, seven, eight, nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| look at the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| If the result still shows a disparity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| then take proactive measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| to correct the disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Don't waste time saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| we didn't mean to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| we didn't do it intentionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| that was not a conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Don't waste time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| What's the result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| The result is after 11 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| you have virtually no business going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| to African Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| and it's so bad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| you look at the business going to women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| which is despicable as a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| Let me say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| and I'll take any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| We don't want to be compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| with the worst that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| If you see how bad things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| in Nashville or in Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| or in Johnson City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| say, well, we're not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| That's not the horse we're running with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| We're running with Secretariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| That's who we're running with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| We're running with Secretariat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| So don't compare us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| to the slowest horse in the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| We're running with Secretariat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| and when you compare and contrast us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| to Secretariat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| we're not doing good at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| But we have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| in this city and this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Does your association help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| black contractors submit bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| does the Black Contracting Association do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Minority Contracting Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| The association doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| but we have members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| who assist other contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| to submit bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| I'm trying to get to the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| are we not getting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| coming forward with the bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| or are we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| they're too discouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| to come forward with the bids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| I don't quite understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| what you're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Mr. Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Mayor Brown has had his light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Well, I'll cede to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| I was trying to get down to specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| We'll get back to you, Mr. Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Zimbabwe, thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| And you are saying that you're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| and you're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| that you would sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| or work with Boss Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| and come up with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| I think if we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| if that will come out of this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| I think that would be a very positive thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| in addition to at least one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| Mr. Evans, I'm going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| would you be willing to work with Zimbabwe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| on that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Well, I think that would be very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| I don't know who else to recommend right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| but I think we'd need at least three of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| a committee of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| But out of that, that would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| I think we can cut through a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| And I think everyone, we're not opposed to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| We're trying to get a balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| and help with the minority businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| the women-owned businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| and help bring up the standard in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| So from my point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| I think that's a very good suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| and I hope that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| and we will try to make it happen as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Mr. Matavo, help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Yes, that's good, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Now, let me, we have two folks signed up on the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Do we want to hear from the folks who are signed up for public forum now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Let's go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Mr. Vern Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Quick note, I might follow up on Mayor Brown's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| And Mr. Evans, if you know of any other representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| from any other small disadvantaged businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| you know, that may be productive in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| I know there's other organizations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| They may not be actively involved with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| but I'm sure they are with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| and with Oak Ridge and in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| So I think that might be advantageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| because I think there are some things that can be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| in terms of our recognizing opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| and reaching out and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| so that if there are opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| that our businesses within the community can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| And I think that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| So I just would ask you to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| Mr. Patterson, if you give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| My name is Vernon Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| I reside at 922 Stewart Street, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| I have been in Knoxville for approximately 11 years, 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| And I came from a very large metropolitan area just outside of Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| I have worked in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| I've worked in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| And I have always been involved in one component of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| which is Build America, construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| the construction business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| I think that's one of the major components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| if not the component we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| And how do we get minorities more involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| in helping build America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| and helping Knox County and the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| get more minority participation in the construction industry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| And that question comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| why are we not getting more minority participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| We have a lot of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| We have processes and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| and all the things that we feel we should have and need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| in order to make that happen, but it's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| The big question is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| I've always asked myself why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| And I hear from particularly the African-American population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| of the construction business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| It boils down to they feel that it's already a done deal before they bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| They feel that they cannot get bonding in order to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| They feel that there's not a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| to encourage the major construction companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| to even entertain hiring minority subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| Now, what I've always heard and what I see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| in a lot of the RFPs and the bids is the word encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| We encourage you contractors who bid to hire minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| Encouragement does not require them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| It just says we encourage you to, we hope you will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| Nine times out of ten, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| They don't have to, so they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| And they may say we tried and we looked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| but I don't know where they're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I've been here 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| And maybe they make a couple of calls, maybe they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| I have found that examples of what the federal government does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| and what other major metropolitans do is they will have requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5397)|
| 1:30:05| That if you're going to bid as a major primary contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| you will have minority participation no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| or you won't get the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| RFPs, you can simply do that by having them bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| in the minorities up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| Name who they're going to have on their team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| and stick to it and commit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| The word commitment is a much stronger word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| in my mind, than encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| And so when I see RFPs come out, I go through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| and it says we encourage and hope that you hire minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| It won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| And then we run into the situation which is point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| We have minority participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| We have women-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Quite frankly, if you look at the percentages of women-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| businesses compared to what we call African American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| 90% or 99% of those businesses are owned by white women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| It is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| A lot of contractors put their wives in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| or their best friends or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| There's nothing wrong with that because that's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| It allows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| When it comes to the minority African American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| the question is why are they not getting the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| And I think a lot of it has to do with the discouragement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| that they have experienced in the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| this disparity study and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| It's great, but if you don't implement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| and if you don't make it better, then it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| So I recommend, just from a personal side of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| and from my experiences, encouragement is not the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| Commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| You ask our major contractors, you ask our city officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| you ask anyone who has to do with this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| of construction to commit up front and bring minorities in that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| rather than after they get the bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| and you may or may not get any participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| And you also have to help minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| The minority companies are not large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| If they're large, you wouldn't have a disparity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| You would not have the problems we have, simply put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| Thank you, Mr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| David Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5542)|
| 1:32:32| Yes, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| My name is David Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| I am an electrical contractor, been in business for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| Yes, we have done contracts with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| We have an ongoing contract right now with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5569)|
| 1:32:57| We've done several jobs here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| We're licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| We're bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| We're insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| Have the highest license that you can attain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| So I feel like I'm competent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| However, Vernon Patterson said it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Contractors generally like to contract to subcontractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| and you would consider me as a subcontractor that they are familiar with, I find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| And if the city of Knoxville does not offer any incentives to those contractors to include minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5615)|
| 1:33:47| contractors, then it will never change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| Thank you, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Is there any discussion among counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| Ms. Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| I think what we've heard tonight is that the city has made an ongoing effort to address this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| but it hasn't been enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| We have a problem in front of us that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I think we've heard some productive solutions tonight, which is always encouraging on counsel to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5658)|
| 1:34:26| rather than just the problem that there's some productive ideas out there for future solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| I'm glad to know that the city issued the RFP for a contractor to help with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| that that person might be able to bring some new ideas to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| And I'm encouraged that our mayor is taking some leadership in encouraging this meeting to take place with Mr. Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| and Mr. Matavu and a third person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| And I'm hopeful that a report will come back to this body very shortly that we're going to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| I was going to ask Boyce if you could tell us something about this idea of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5702)|
| 1:35:10| in at least construction contracts, which was what we heard about, some requirement of a percentage participation being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| part of the RFP or being part of the evaluation of the bid so that if I'm a guy that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5717)|
| 1:35:24| and pledges to have, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 percent minority participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| I get credit points towards my bid that makes it more favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| What are we doing in that regard that kind of gets where the rubber meets the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| We're kind of getting a little bit deep into procurement here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| When you're talking a straight design and then build, in other words, the construction invitation to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5748)|
| 1:35:58| where the design's already done, now you're going out with an invitation to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| it frankly comes down to the bidding entities saying they can do all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5762)|
| 1:36:11| agreeing to what all is in the boilerplate, having the proper licensing classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| and then the price drives the train by the city code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5776)|
| 1:36:25| But is there something in that price evaluation that says you get price credit for having a commitment of a minority subcontractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Not in a straight invitation to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| If it were a request for proposal, like if we hire, let's say we went, a lot of firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5798)|
| 1:36:45| or entities now go to the contractor at risk thing where you hire an entity to handle the whole project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5805)|
| 1:37:05| i.e., this entity will take the money, he's going to hire an architect, go through his own procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| then he's going to, once that's done, the design's done, he's going to go out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| If you're in an RFP type situation, you can award those points, like I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| for having a sound plan to hire subcontractors and subconsultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| But as far as a financial incentive, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| And if you were to get into any type of financial incentive, such as bid discounting like we talked about, national,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| my limited understanding of the law is that it has to be race and gender neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5863)|
| 1:37:52| You can make it apply to small businesses in a certain region, but you can't, it has to be race and gender neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| I mean, Ms. Poplin or others might correct me, but that's my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| You were making a distinction at least between an invitation to bid, which is a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| and cents evaluation, and an RFP that has more leeway in describing what the surface is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| Affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| The request for proposals process, you get a little more subjectivity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| You've got the evaluation committee looking at it, and that's one of the things they do consider is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| you know, what's your plan to do business with minority-owned firms or women-owned firms or small businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| I mean, they're looking at all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| But when it's a straight invitation to bid, price kind of drives the train if you've met all the other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| We're in a procedural quagmire here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| Do you wish to hear further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| I move we suspend the rules and allow him to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| Seeing none, Mr. Mutavu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| The Croson case coming out of Virginia, which established how essential disparage of studies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5946)|
| 1:39:19| set us on an approach that, if we adhere to it, would resolve a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5959)|
| 1:39:30| It makes available, as part of the processes for resolving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5970)|
| 1:39:40| those efforts that are race-neutral and those efforts that are not race-neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5980)|
| 1:39:49| It says that your first effort should be whether or not you can resolve the problem by using race-neutral efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=5989)|
| 1:40:02| processes, procedures, implementations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| If, in fact, after a given amount of years, you examine your progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| and you find that you have failed or you are seriously failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| you then can implement race-conscious processes, procedures, and implementations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6019)|
| 1:40:27| You can present any combination of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| That is the significance of the Croson decision and why it is imperative to proceed your processes with a disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6031)|
| 1:40:43| It's good that we understand that, and that's why it's important that city council buys off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| So if there is a challenge, and I think that there will be few, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| but if there is a challenge, you can win the challenge because you have proceeded according to the dictates of Croson decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6056)|
| 1:41:05| and from the information found in the disparity study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| Further discussion among council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| I just wanted to reiterate what Councilman Roddy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| I'm glad we had this workshop, and we did hear a lot of good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6083)|
| 1:41:30| and I'm glad we conducted, convened here around this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| And I also appreciate what Mayor Brown has recommended based upon Zimbabwe Metabo's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6096)|
| 1:41:46| I do want to say that this is an important issue and dynamic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| and I appreciate what Mr. Patterson commented in a very kind way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| You know, if someone locks you out of the house, your problem is not with the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| and we're like fiddling around with numbers in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| I think that's important, but somehow we have perhaps an attitude in our community that based upon the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6126)|
| 1:42:14| that we only feel comfortable with people we feel comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| we're not meeting each other and getting to know each other in all the different corners of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| And while this might not seem fair, there is a long-term impact of how we raise our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6145)|
| 1:42:33| and what our children are looking at in terms of their aspiration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| in terms of the fields that they want to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| It also, if our business, if we can't figure out a way that the business community will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| will work with minority contractors and do it in a way that also pleases them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| because I think that they don't realize the kind of talent that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| I know several minority business owners who are doing quite well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| but they're doing quite well getting business somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| I mean, they're here, but they're doing business elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| and it's just somehow that the relationship hasn't been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| And I hear we're making really good efforts, and I applaud our efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| but I guess I just want to say that I'm glad we convened this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| It is an issue, and it's not just a small issue, it's a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| And who knows, there might be somebody in this room who's running for mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| and might want to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| Further comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Seeing none, thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| You are invited to remain for the special called meeting, which is scheduled to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| Let me ask council's pleasure with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| Do you want to take a five-minute break or do you just want to go straight ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| I see a no to the five-minute break, and I see a yes to the five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| Everyone who would favor a five-minute break, raise your hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| Everyone who would prefer not to, please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| We're going to take a five-minute break and be back here at 651 promptly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| to start the special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/council-workshop-feb-0310-preview?start=6259)|
