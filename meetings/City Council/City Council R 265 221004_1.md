| 2:30:43| We've got foreign-based codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| We've got Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| We have South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| So wall volumes have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| Demand has gone up on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| We have fewer staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| So part of this is trying to get better efficiencies for the customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| and adequate resources for Peter's team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| So the only way we can do this really with the civil service model is to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| and realign this into the mayor's office, hire someone in as in this zoning position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9062)|
| 2:31:09| let that person work with Amy and with Harold and with their developer roundtable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| to start forming this department of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| Again, that function already happens as a division within plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| This would create a department of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| Aaron and I are both pretty swamped, so we need to get someone in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| to help us get into the end zone on that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| The model would be a zoning department with the existing staff that we already have budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9090)|
| 2:31:36| and then aligning with the staff that provides some of those functions and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| That happens some now, but it's a little ad hoc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| Sometimes people talk to planning, then they talk to Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| We really want to have somebody that wakes up every day and has the bandwidth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| and the skill set to not only understand plans review, getting permits through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9110)|
| 2:31:54| but also planning on the long range end, right, long range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| Sometimes Peter gets very busy, and so trying to make sure that we have good communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| between those functions, we want this individual to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| And so they will initially report in to Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| They'll be working with Aaron and I, waking up every day, helping us get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| But this move is temporary until we can create the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| Ms. Drummond is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| We'll need to work with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| Those positions will have to be moved over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| We'll have to go through that system of accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| through the Civil Service Merit Board and Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| and that will take six months or so to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| I'm not going to vote against this, but I'd like a further meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9152)|
| 2:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9156)|
| 2:32:38| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| Certainly when we're talking about withdrawing some funds from the unassigned fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9161)|
| 2:32:47| I think certainly some review needs to be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| Director Evans, just looking at what we're proposing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| it looks like it's a little more than $7.5 million being drawn out of unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| What is the overall impact of that withdrawal from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9180)|
| 2:33:04| or that draw from unassigned fund balance because of this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| Boyce Evans, Chief Financial Officer for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| Council will remember last spring as we were doing the budget preparation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| we estimated ending FY22, the FY we just ended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| with an unassigned fund balance in the general fund of $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9204)|
| 2:33:31| and we produced a trial balance last week for FY22 as part of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9211)|
| 2:33:41| Now, this was a preliminary trial balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| Numbers move up and down and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| but at that time after we'd already got this out there about the budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9226)|
| 2:33:54| we looked at it and the trial balance showed the general fund unassigned fund balance being right at $27 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9234)|
| 2:34:03| So the bottom line is this budget amendment shouldn't really have any effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9243)|
| 2:34:10| on where we thought we were going to end the FY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| I just want to put in there a big disclaimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| I mean, this is preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| It was a preliminary trial balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| Those numbers change until the audit is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9262)|
| 2:34:26| but I will tell you that we're in decent shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9266)|
| 2:34:29| I have absolutely no reservations in saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| Thank you, Director Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| What was the cause for the increase in the unassigned fund balance from what you projected to the trial balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9276)|
| 2:34:44| There's several factors, but the biggest one is the increase in local option sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9284)|
| 2:34:54| significantly above what we had budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| That is to say we had budgeted $47 million in some change to end the FY22 in local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9298)|
| 2:35:11| We actually came in at $56.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| That's $9.9 million above where we thought we were going to land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| And to tell you the truth, it's not because of poor budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| I look back through the records, kind of the same thought you had, which is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| We had gone up and we budgeted in FY21 $42 million in some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9330)|
| 2:35:36| We increased that for FY22 by $47 million in some change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9336)|
| 2:35:43| and it just frankly went through the roof, $9.92 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9343)|
| 2:35:50| If I had to say what's the long pole in the tent, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| I've got a little bit of time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| I wanted to see if Casey Krause was here because one of the amendments here that's drawing from the account we just talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9359)|
| 2:36:08| is for the urban forest master plan, which I'm very supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9368)|
| 2:36:14| We don't have a whole lot of time left, Mr. Krause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| but can you talk to us a little bit about that master plan and summarize maybe your goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| and what you're looking at to be able to get from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| Casey Krause, Urban Forester City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| We are in the middle of looking at consultants right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| and trying to finalize the consultant who will work with us on this urban forest master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9396)|
| 2:36:42| Essentially what we're going to do is take our code of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| our urban canopy assessment that was done a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| looking at the way my staff operates, my operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| looking at that and trying to figure out how all this meshes into a 30-year plan for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9416)|
| 2:37:05| It doesn't just pertain to public trees, but trees on both public and private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| and essentially how we can better ensure that this resource is going to be there for the next 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9431)|
| 2:37:19| looking at two to four-year benchmarks in order to try and capture essentially what some of these concerns we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9439)|
| 2:37:29| We talk about the heat island effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9449)|
| 2:37:30| We talk about invasive species, all of these different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| and how to address those things in that 30-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9454)|
| 2:37:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9460)|
| 2:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| I'm going back to beat a dead horse with this planning thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9463)|
| 2:37:51| Oops, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| I was about to say that's what happens when you beat a dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| They turn off your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| This feels like a precursor to the city having a planning department and the county doing something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9482)|
| 2:38:13| I just want to make sure we fully vet this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9493)|
| 2:38:15| This is a $25,000 issue in the budget, but I think it is about something much bigger or could be much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9495)|
| 2:38:29| Deputy Gill, did you say that this may be something that comes to us in next year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9509)|
| 2:38:36| Yes, so I think that you are spot on to say that it is part of a larger conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| However, I think we want to be very clear that at this time we don't yet know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| We would not want to predict exactly what we would bring back to you for that longer term because of exactly what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9525)|
| 2:38:51| that it needs careful vetting and a lot of due diligence, both internally as well as with our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| to be able to fully confirm what that path ahead ought to look like and where it needs to change, if at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| So we have recognized the immediate need to address the customer experience and the streamlining of the customer experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9542)|
| 2:39:09| and that is the piece that we can say solidly needs a person to help do that work, and that is where we're starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| But I think you are spot on to say that our intention is to make sure that we do not jump into that deep end without knowing how to swim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9555)|
| 2:39:23| and being able to articulate to you, as well as to our partners, the direction that we would want to head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| And since the next fiscal year budget will be built probably within the next four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9569)|
| 2:39:36| are we anticipating that we'll have answers by this budget cycle or it might be another year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9576)|
| 2:39:44| I think that we'll have some answers for this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| And again, I go back to that first step of trying to streamline that customer experience for the folks who are bringing us projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9587)|
| 2:39:53| Well, I'm all for improving the customer experience, but it sounds like it could be much bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| and I think that has lots of ramifications to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9598)|
| 2:40:03| And when we get there, I'm sure we will have workshops and many discussions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9603)|
| 2:40:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| I'll just add that we're expecting to get some reports back from the Matrix Consulting firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| and that will also help inform our path forward, and we haven't seen that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| And when we do, obviously, we'd be glad to do a workshop with Council when that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| Thank you, Mayor, for those comments, because I'd love to have a workshop about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9632)|
| 2:40:36| I hope the Vice Mayor is making notes for the next survey of Council dates and times and workshops and good stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9636)|
| 2:40:44| Yeah, so my question was going to be what the time frame is for the consulting firm that's working on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9644)|
| 2:40:50| and in essence of time, I guess I will just say in follow-up conversations I'd like to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9650)|
| 2:40:58| I'd like some clarity on how this differs or supplements what Brian Berry is already doing within the Plans Review Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9658)|
| 2:41:09| how the roundtable that's already there is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9669)|
| 2:41:15| I mean, I have lots of developers, builders, people just simply homeowners trying to get permits that are asking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9675)|
| 2:41:24| when things are going to improve on expediting getting permits, and I'll just, so many things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9684)|
| 2:41:32| and Mr. Cannon, just to put you on the spot because I'm tying it all together here, is, you know, the conversations about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9692)|
| 2:41:40| I have people in my district that can't get permits because of the definition of a lot of record that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9700)|
| 2:41:48| that differs from every other municipality in the state that is limiting their ability to get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| and interestingly, I've had more than one person locally that can't get their permits because of that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9714)|
| 2:42:02| and they cannot get appraisers, I'm sorry, surveyors to do property surveys that are under $2,000 to $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9722)|
| 2:42:13| and multiple of them have sent me messages, not just one, but multiple have sent me messages about how much it costs to get a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9733)|
| 2:42:19| to be able to get these things to happen, and it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| I'm getting a piece of property in Georgia surveyed, my father's, and when the surveyor asked me if I wanted to plat it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9742)|
| 2:42:30| I was very hesitant because of what I hear about here, and I said, well, how much is that going to cost me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| and how does that benefit me, and he said, well, it's $100, and I was like, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| So I was like, okay, $100, I'll go on forward, it's not $4,000 or an extra $2,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9760)|
| 2:42:45| so I don't understand what the differences are, but I know Mr. Brace has offered to sit down and explain things for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9765)|
| 2:42:52| so I do need a lot of explanation as to why we have all these barriers that I somehow am not experiencing in another state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9772)|
| 2:43:01| and I know that's what people say all the time, and I think they're exaggerating their complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| and then when I get down there and they're like, it's $100 extra, I'm like, I don't understand how that could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| but go ahead and plat it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| So it's just a giant mystery, and I definitely want things to move along faster, and I know you guys do too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9793)|
| 2:43:20| so I'll leave it at that for now, and I look forward to hearing a lot more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9800)|
| 2:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| Mr. Cannon, do you know when the matrix report is expected to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| Harold Cannon, Chief Economic Development Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| We have a couple of things running in parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| Right now the law department is working diligently to revise the ordinances associated with platting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9820)|
| 2:43:49| because we do have a mess, no question about it, and it can be simplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9829)|
| 2:43:55| Matrix is wrapping up their report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| We will be getting a draft of what is called low-hanging fruit, if you will, this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| that I'll be going over with Mr. Ahrens, Mr. Clabo's teams, to see what we can begin to move forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9843)|
| 2:44:11| The actual report, it will be provided to the city administration first part of November for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9851)|
| 2:44:18| Then there will be a presentation the latter part of November, probably the same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9858)|
| 2:44:24| where we will have a luncheon with the developers' roundtable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| and then that evening there will be a council meeting, a dinner prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9867)|
| 2:44:34| We will be going over exactly what Matrix's recommendations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| and Matrix will be here to make that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| It will not be us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9882)|
| 2:44:43| We want you to hear directly from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| I'm anticipating that in December we will be bringing you revised ordinances associated with platting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9886)|
| 2:44:54| to get that process moving as promptly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| That is one of the top two issues that the development community brought to Matrix's attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9898)|
| 2:45:05| and we knew that, and that's why we've been proactive in getting that moving a little beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| Councilwoman, I hope that begins to answer at least part of your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9911)|
| 2:45:16| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| More to come in the very near future on all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9918)|
| 2:45:22| I just did want to say that we are lucky to be in a city where we're having record number of investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9922)|
| 2:45:27| record number of building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| and our plans, reviews, and inspections team is doing a really pretty good job keeping up with it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9929)|
| 2:45:37| despite some of the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| But I think some of these changes that are coming are going to make things better for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| and for people investing in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9943)|
| 2:45:48| But it takes some time, and I appreciate everyone's patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9948)|
| 2:45:51| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| I wanted to go back to the largest piece of this budget amendment, which is the facade of the public safety complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9954)|
| 2:46:04| Mr. Brace, I would assume there was a preliminary inspection of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9964)|
| 2:46:13| Can you walk council through what inspections were conducted and how we got to where we are now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9973)|
| 2:46:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| So I appreciate the question, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| So our design team hired an envelope expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9983)|
| 2:46:29| This is an engineer that works on and understands roofing systems and facades and veneers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9989)|
| 2:46:36| So as part of the assessment of the building, they looked at the veneer, they looked at the roofing systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=9996)|
| 2:46:42| and they gave us recommendations on, for example, two of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10002)|
| 2:46:46| we fully replaced the roof with a membrane EPDM roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| The POB building, the professional office building, actually had some life left, so we did patching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10010)|
| 2:46:56| That firm also looked at the condition of the veneer and gave recommendations about caulking and repairs to bricks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10016)|
| 2:47:03| based on his initial assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| So our scope of work that went in for that project included not the roofs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10026)|
| 2:47:12| but for the veneer on the POB building, about $200,000 to make repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| And so that went into the costing of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| As the project began and Messer Construction moved on to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| there was a corner that Messer, the general contractor, noticed was starting to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| on one corner, starting to break up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| So they pretty quickly notified the prime design firm who then brought in the envelope expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10052)|
| 2:47:39| who spent some time to determine how to assess what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10059)|
| 2:47:44| And what they found was that corner, there wasn't proper fasteners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| and that the brick veneer, about every, I don't know, 10 feet, you need essentially a lintel, a steel plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10069)|
| 2:47:55| So every 10 feet, you've got brick sitting on a steel plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| And we had about a 35 to 40-foot length of brick sitting on a single plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10079)|
| 2:48:07| So not only were the fasteners not properly done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| what had been designed hadn't properly been installed back in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10090)|
| 2:48:14| And so once we knew it in that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| we are really obligated at that point to see where else there were problems, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| We've got a public building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| We've got design professionals with stamps and licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| So we authorized the design firm to then go in and look at some of these other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| And what we found was on the big walls of brick, not where the windows are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10109)|
| 2:48:35| not those shorter areas, but where the big sections of brick, 30, 40, 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10115)|
| 2:48:40| they didn't have adequate fasteners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| And they did not have adequate steel lintels or shelves for the bricks to sit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10122)|
| 2:48:48| And that could be catastrophic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| It could sit there for the next 100 years, but it could also zip off very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10130)|
| 2:48:54| And we're starting to see a little bit of that failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10134)|
| 2:48:57| So once we were put on notice about that, we needed to address it pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| work with Boyce Evans and the law department to start to dig in on both the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| on what the obligations were by the firms, and we're still working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10146)|
| 2:49:10| Was something missed early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| And then also, how do we remedy this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10152)|
| 2:49:15| You know, we're wrapping up this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| We need to move in with a starter move-in in December with police, fire, and pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10157)|
| 2:49:22| We're doing build-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| The air conditioning's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| And so that was what the emergency procurement was that Mr. Evans sent to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10165)|
| 2:49:31| and the mayor authorizing starting the repairs to those sections of the façade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10171)|
| 2:49:37| That's what the $5 million is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| So you're looking at the contracts and the inspections that were going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| but since this building's going to open soon and you now know of a dangerous condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| you need to get it fixed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| So that's why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| Yeah, we discussed was there an ability to open the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| and continue to further assess this and make repairs later, do a longer bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10197)|
| 2:50:01| get a different contractor in, and it just wasn't possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| You have LMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| Those walls are adjacent to the street, some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| So if you go by there now, scaffolding is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| They're starting to prepare for removal and start with the replacement of a new veneer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10211)|
| 2:50:19| And so that system will be in place again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10219)|
| 2:50:22| If you go by there now, you're going to see that scaffolding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| And so that will happen, and we right now plan on starting to move in in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| And so absolutely, your summary was spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| Thank you, Deputy Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10234)|
| 2:50:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| Deputy Mayor Gill, since I've got 20 seconds left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| so thinking about the discussion that was going on previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| what I'm hearing is that this staff change that was discussed regarding zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10243)|
| 2:50:50| you're talking right now about a procedure that will, you think, improve customer service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10250)|
| 2:50:56| not something that is a precursor to making large changes in the way zoning is administrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10256)|
| 2:51:04| between the city and the county and planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| I think we are not touching planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| I want to be very clear about that because that's a whole other legal set of framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10271)|
| 2:51:15| So this is really about how staff work together to execute the functions that various jurisdictions need to execute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10275)|
| 2:51:22| So, again, no change to planning commission whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| I want to be very clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| But, yes, our intention is to make sure that we are working as collaboratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| and as cohesively with our colleagues at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| And in some cases, in particular with zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10294)|
| 2:51:37| we think that we can bring that into much more day-to-day collaboration with this new type of model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10297)|
| 2:51:42| and this is the precursor to getting that started and being able to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| Again, we want to explore this piece of it from a customer service lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| We are open to how that evolves and seeing what works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10310)|
| 2:51:55| And, again, I think we're not here today to provide those recommendations or make those suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10315)|
| 2:52:00| We're really here to say let's address this zoning from a customer experience perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| and get those teams working together, really co-locating them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10324)|
| 2:52:08| and making sure they work together on a day-to-day basis to provide that improved customer experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| And then any further changes, again, that's going to be a discussion that we have with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| And, again, there's a much broader process that has to happen for anything bigger to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| Okay, and I appreciate that, and I just want to echo what my colleagues have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| which is lots more discussion needs to be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10352)|

| 2:54:02| Mr. Givens, 12D, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10442)|
| 2:54:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10453)|
| 2:54:14| Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| So this resolution allows the chief of police to give a kind of reward trinket to officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10455)|
| 2:54:24| and I wanted to, again, pull up the actual language here to make sure I covered part of it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10464)|
| 2:54:31| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10471)|
| 2:54:37| Police are the chiefs authorized but not sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10480)|
| 2:54:41| That's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| Having a minimum of 10 years of service with the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| that officer's service weapon is one of the possible items that could be given to the officers in good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10485)|
| 2:54:55| Does that mean that the gun that killed Anthony Thompson Jr. could go to Officer Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10495)|
| 2:55:01| Is that what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| The officer that shot Philly Feep, he's still in good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| Does he get to keep his gun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| This is weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| This is a weird thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| We have a problem with gun violence in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10514)|
| 2:55:17| We have a problem with gun violence in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| and we have a problem with an extreme culture of guns in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| I own guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| I actually don't really like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| When I grew up, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| When I was younger, I really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| But I don't like them as much as they used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| I don't like the idea of officers carrying guns into schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| I don't like the idea of officers having guns at traffic stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| or when they stop people for public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| I don't like the fact that officers bring guns to city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| I don't like the fact that the chief brings his gun to ice cream socials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10546)|
| 2:55:50| I don't like the idea of weapons used in murders being given to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| that got away with committing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| And so I just find something really icky about this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10555)|
| 2:56:00| We have a lot of officers in Knoxville who are still considered in good standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10560)|
| 2:56:05| that I would really hope don't receive this kind of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| Sergeant Bobby Maxwell, I believe, is still in good standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| He's the one that used the term choke job and pearl necklace in a briefing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| So I wouldn't want him to get one of these trinkets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| but it's solely at the chief's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| Ron Green was also allowed to retire in good standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| so he could have been given one of these trinkets as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10588)|
| 2:56:31| even though there were allegations of sexual misconduct extending back as far as 1998| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| when he was allowed to retire without any kind of penalty and with his pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| And now he would be allowed to keep his service weapon and badge as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10602)|
| 2:56:48| I believe Christopher Brooks, who assaulted Raymond Alvin Taylor Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10608)|
| 2:56:55| is also still in good standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| even though Taylor received a $150,000 taxpayer-funded settlement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10618)|
| 2:57:03| If Joseph Roberts had not committed his second crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| he would also still be in good standing after his assault of Trinity Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10627)|
| 2:57:11| So there are just a lot of things that I find very disturbing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| Brian Calvin Lee, another person shot by Knoxville police, not on body camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10636)|
| 2:57:21| shot by the Special Operations Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10641)|
| 2:57:24| Now they're currently—the rules have been changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| and they're required to wear body cameras now, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| But the officers that were involved in that quote-unquote exchange of gunfire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| although it only seems evidence of gunfire coming from one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| would also be allowed to take their firearms home with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| I assume that James Gadd was in good standing after shooting Sierra McCauley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| He'd be eligible to keep his weapon as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10663)|
| 2:57:46| Jason Minnick was also killed by police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| and I'm sure they'd be able to keep their guns as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| Again, the way that we are trying to do something about our police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10671)|
| 2:57:56| these measures, this giving them extra trinkets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10676)|
| 2:58:00| spending extra money on our police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| spending $65 million on our police while we spend $5 million on affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10682)|
| 2:58:07| this is not how you get an accountable, responsible police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| that is responsive and representative of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| Having a command staff entirely of white folks in a city that's at least 17% black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10694)|
| 2:58:20| and a smattering of other minorities is not made up for by letting them keep their guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10700)|
| 2:58:27| We need real solutions to the problems in our police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10707)|
| 2:58:33| and the problems in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| and that's not being offered here, and I find it very disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10715)|
| 2:58:40| So I guess if you guys want to go ahead and vote to let officers take their guns home with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10720)|
| 2:58:44| after they kill people, as long as they hang around for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| and they don't get charged by our district attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| and the command structure covers up their crimes and doesn't hold them accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| then I guess that's the vote you can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| But I would hope that you would see that this is unnecessary and silly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10734)|
| 2:59:00| and maybe should be changed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| Now, if you want to give somebody a little glass plaque for 10 years of service, that sounds great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10742)|
| 2:59:06| but a gun, a badge, a symbol of the authority given to them by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10746)|
| 2:59:11| that is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10751)|

| 3:02:30| Yeah, I have some questions for Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10950)|
| 3:02:33| and I'd just like to say there was opposition to this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10953)|
| 3:02:37| so I put a lot of thought into it and a lot of analysis into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10957)|
| 3:02:42| Mr. Welch, can you – so I know this is a rezone, simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10962)|
| 3:02:51| not including a sector plan and a one-year plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| It is low density, both RN-1 and RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10974)|
| 3:03:00| Can you kind of help me – can you talk about the balance between RN-1, RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10980)|
| 3:03:06| and the necessity for this lot to be RN-2, how that changes things on this lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10986)|
| 3:03:13| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10993)|
| 3:03:14| Yes, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10994)|
| 3:03:15| The RN-1 and RN-2 both allow for low density residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=10995)|
| 3:03:22| and under RN-2 you can have a duplex with 10,000 square foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11002)|
| 3:03:31| and this particular parcel is greater than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| By right or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11013)|
| 3:03:34| By special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11014)|
| 3:03:35| By special use, so it would require additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| It would still come back through for review of the duplex in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11017)|
| 3:03:43| So Planning Commission staff felt that the lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11023)|
| 3:03:48| and the opportunity to have a vacant piece of property have infill development at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11028)|
| 3:03:54| and the property owner was considering having a duplex at this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11034)|
| 3:04:00| that this was an appropriate rezoning for that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11040)|
| 3:04:04| It's allowed, again, under the existing – computer just went down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11044)|
| 3:04:10| but it is allowed as a low density residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| and would require special use to come back through Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11054)|
| 3:04:18| And they can still do single family at the site as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| They can still do single family, correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| But the differences in RN-2 and RN-1 with the single family is setbacks primarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11062)|
| 3:04:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11068)|
| 3:04:29| Okay, so just slightly different setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11072)|
| 3:04:33| You know, in analyzing this, I thought of all the many instances in my district alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| that came to mind where duplexes are intermingled with single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| and actually I own one, so it would be very hypocritical of me to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11084)|
| 3:04:49| that we can't have a duplex in the midst of single family that we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11089)|
| 3:04:54| The other thing that I have a question about, Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| is many of the lots that abut this one and are across it or around the corner from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11097)|
| 3:05:04| they're all zoned RN-1, and they were all rezoned RN-1 in the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11104)|
| 3:05:10| but many of them are very tiny lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11110)|
| 3:05:13| Some of them are 50 by 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| So all of this is nonconforming, existing nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11115)|
| 3:05:21| Not all of it, but many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| Some very bizarre lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11127)|
| 3:05:28| The lot sizes range, again, as you indicated, from about 5,800 to 11,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| abutting this property and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| and normally about 8,000 square feet is about typical that we saw in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11136)|
| 3:05:42| Gotcha, and so many of them are well under the 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11145)|
| 3:05:46| Okay, and don't meet the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| Yeah, there's a couple adjacent to that are a little over 10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11148)|
| 3:05:51| some that get a little further out from there are greater than 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11151)|
| 3:05:54| I didn't measure a dozen of them, but seven right adjacent to the property we did measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11154)|
| 3:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11161)|

| 3:06:13| 12K is an ordinance to amend Ordinance No. 0-107-2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11173)|

| 3:06:23| from property located at 5233 McIntyre Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11183)|

| 3:06:35| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11195)|
| 3:06:36| Yeah, I'd like to ask Mr. Mullins a couple of questions if he has time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| I believe he represents the applicants on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11200)|
| 3:06:47| So at this time, they're just trying to remove the expired old concept plan, I believe it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11213)|
| 3:06:54| There was a previously under an RP1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| I think there was a plan that was approved in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| It's long expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| But when the code came through, they changed this to the RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11225)|
| 3:07:10| You know, we still have the overlay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| Yeah, I think there's an interpretation that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| When you say the overlay, you mean hillside protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| No, not the overlay that we're removing in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11240)|
| 3:07:21| It's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11241)|
| 3:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| So we're just seeking to remove that so there's no question we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11243)|
| 3:07:27| and develop it consistently with the current RN2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11247)|
| 3:07:31| So right now the plan is to develop it consistent with RN2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11251)|
| 3:07:35| Because I'm getting a lot of questions from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| Yeah, we're not asking to rezone it to anything else other than what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11258)|
| 3:07:41| It's just to remove the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| Thank you, because, you know, when you guys solidify your plans, your client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| the community does, you know, want to know what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11269)|
| 3:07:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11273)|
| 3:07:54| I understand there's a lot of interest in this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| You know, it's a 70-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| It's one of the larger undeveloped lots in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| You know, I've had some conversations with Mr. Collins and other people about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11280)|
| 3:08:05| When we move forward, and I'm not sure, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| exactly what type of plan they're going to move forward with yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11287)|
| 3:08:11| they're still working out the details on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| but it will have to go back through planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| either as a concept plan or, you know, duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| something you were just talking about in RN2 before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| You know, that would be a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| So there will be more time for community input to look at what's going on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11303)|
| 3:08:28| and make sure their concerns are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11310)|

| 3:09:57| Charles, I want to say I really appreciate what you said about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| the art committee having the responsibility of coming up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| that project and that it was what they put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11403)|
| 3:10:06| and so that's why you voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11406)|
| 3:10:07| And I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11407)|
| 3:10:08| I respect that acknowledgement of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| But I do think we have an issue with transparency and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11411)|
| 3:10:16| accountability, especially in the executive of our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11416)|

| 3:10:19| You know, we've got something got slipped in under a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| agenda item here that surprised everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| We've got lawsuits over open records requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11424)|
| 3:10:27| We've got lack of transparency in the chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11427)|
| 3:10:30| You know, it's just really disappointing the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11430)|
| 3:10:35| administration runs things here and that city council isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11435)|
| 3:10:38| always looped in properly and given all the information in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11438)|
| 3:10:40| timely manner, that they give you your agendas at the very last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11440)|
| 3:10:43| minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11443)|
| 3:10:44| You've got to scramble over a weekend to try to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| And you guys have the power to do things about that, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11446)|
| 3:10:49| really wish you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| I think the mayor is too powerful in this meeting, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| think she acts egregiously because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11453)|
| 3:10:57| And, again, you can make somebody else the chairperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| You've got Will Johnson sitting right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11460)|
| 3:11:01| He's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11461)|
| 3:11:02| He gives her tips when she's having trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| He could run these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11464)|
| 3:11:05| The vice chair could run the meetings when the mayor wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| speak about a particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| That's how it's supposed to be done, under Robert's rules of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11471)|
| 3:11:12| So I just find it always frustrating and confusing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11472)|
| 3:11:17| the mayor gives her a little speech about the rules of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| we're supposed to say in council and how you're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| follow decorum and all that stuff, and then she completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| ignores it, speaks on every issue, rebuts people who speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11484)|
| 3:11:28| in public, rebuts council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| Gosh, it's just you guys could be so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11491)|
| 3:11:35| And I know you're just part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| I know you're just part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11497)|
| 3:11:38| You don't get paid a whole lot to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11498)|
| 3:11:40| You all have real jobs, for the most part, and you've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11500)|
| 3:11:42| lot of hours, a lot of things to do every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| I understand that, and I appreciate it, but we need a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| democracy in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11506)|
| 3:11:48| We need to move away from the centralized power that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| here in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| A lot of cities were built this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| Our city couldn't be formed this way in Tennessee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| They wouldn't allow a city to be structured the way ours is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| We got grandfathered in, in this undemocratic system of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11520)|
| 3:12:03| extremely strong mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| And again, you guys can pass charter amendments, and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| don't want to do that, you can change the rules of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11528)|
| 3:12:10| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11530)|
| 3:12:11| You can do that at any time and fix it so it is more equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11531)|
| 3:12:14| Tell the mayor she's got to give you two weeks to review the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| agenda if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11536)|
| 3:12:17| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11537)|
| 3:12:18| You all can make that the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| You can make yourselves more powerful and the mayor less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| because that's what we need in a democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| You guys are so much closer to the citizens than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11547)|
| 3:12:30| administration is, so much closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| You hear from your constituents every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| The mayor, when she gets asked by the newspaper tough questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| says she has to go to lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11558)|
| 3:12:40| When she gets asked tough questions by the public, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11560)|
| 3:12:42| hides and runs away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11562)|
| 3:12:44| I don't know how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| I know you guys go to a few public events with her, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| don't know how many you go to, but I can't tell you how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| times I've heard people say, you know, she just left immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11570)|
| 3:12:53| and she didn't leave time to talk to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| I know you guys do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| So I just wish that you would take your passion for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| and the things that you're concerned about and grab hold of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| the power that people have given you here and take more control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11585)|
| 3:13:10| of our city, be more involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11590)|
| 3:13:13| Don't let the mayor's office, who is so heavily influenced by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11593)|
| 3:13:17| the wealthy here in Knoxville, don't let her run these agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11597)|
| 3:13:21| Don't let her decide what you guys are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11601)|
| 3:13:24| Don't just vote yes for everything she puts forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11604)|
| 3:13:27| Take the power back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| Change the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11609)|
| 3:13:30| Change the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| I just have so much hope for this city, and it's such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11613)|
| 3:13:39| beautiful place, and I just want it to be better, and I know you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11619)|
| 3:13:42| guys do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11622)|
| 3:13:45| You guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| I don't know what the administration wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| I can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11629)|
| 3:13:50| It's just power and property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| That's all I see them caring about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| So I just urge you to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11634)|
| 3:13:58| Pay attention to our police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| Pay attention to our little planning committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| Pay attention to what the mayor and her office are doing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| slip it in on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| Don't let her get away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11646)|
| 3:14:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| Next person signed up to speak at public forum is Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11649)|
| 3:14:13| Mr. Emmons, you come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11656)|
| 3:14:27| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11667)|
| 3:14:28| I'm Sam Emmons, and I live at 301 Woodlawn Pike here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11668)|
| 3:14:36| So many things, so many things involved in a city, and one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| the things that's greatly involved in a city, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| complex system, the people who live in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| the people who live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| And I think, you know, one thing that is a really common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11689)|
| 3:14:54| experience in our culture is that we kind of abstract away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11694)|
| 3:14:58| from real life in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| But people, like physical people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11702)|
| 3:15:04| we all actually have physical bodies and we're tangible, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11704)|
| 3:15:08| So in a lot of aspects in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| I'm trying to focus on the tangible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| But I think having that mindset changes the way we look at city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11713)|
| 3:15:18| level issues or even national level issues that affect the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11718)|
| 3:15:23| So I'm going to talk about one of those a little bit tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| So many aspects of American life are predicated on the notion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11727)|
| 3:15:33| having a chance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| A lot of different opinions, but each party really just wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11735)|
| 3:15:40| a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11740)|
| 3:15:41| And that's been the case for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| for a long time in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| And really since its founding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| So since those early days, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| the idea of having a chance still dominates the American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11752)|
| 3:15:57| psyche, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| And some part of our human nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| some part of our human nature wants the prospect of a bright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11763)|
| 3:16:06| future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11766)|
| 3:16:08| And in recognition of this, we often seek opportunities for work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11768)|
| 3:16:13| that improve our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| And we connect with cultural institutions that improve our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11775)|
| 3:16:20| understanding of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11780)|
| 3:16:23| When we think our chances are slim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11783)|
| 3:16:26| we're tempted to give up or escape or lash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11786)|
| 3:16:32| So in a city like Knoxville, to promote hope and life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11792)|
| 3:16:37| we have programs like school lunch provision, festivals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11797)|
| 3:16:42| nonprofit support, parks, different celebrations like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11802)|
| 3:16:51| And not only that, many people, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| in spite of all those things going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| it's easy to forget why we live in a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| There are a lot of reasons, but one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| one reason in general is to seek opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11821)|
| 3:17:05| even if it sometimes proves elusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11825)|
| 3:17:09| So it's a very American idea, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11829)|
| 3:17:12| that a person should have a chance at life, liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11832)|
| 3:17:16| and happiness regardless of their ideology, ethnicity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11836)|
| 3:17:21| national origin, or socioeconomic status, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| So at this point, right, I'll maybe take a turn that some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| you might disagree with, and I'll say that it's with this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| mind that for me, I believe that unborn children should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11853)|
| 3:17:38| given a chance at life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11858)|
| 3:17:41| So this is often thought of as a national or state topic, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11861)|
| 3:17:46| but I think it's important to talk about, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11866)|
| 3:17:51| since the policies on this actually affect aspects of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11871)|
| 3:17:56| population in our city, the real physical people living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11876)|
| 3:18:01| Knoxville, and there are a lot of reasons why people disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| with my opinion on this, and I'll just, I'll look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11886)|
| 3:18:14| I'll talk about maybe two of those without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11894)|
| 3:18:17| I'm not like disparaging people who hold this opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11897)|
| 3:18:20| but I'm just going to look at two arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11900)|
| 3:18:22| One is we won't be able to afford the child, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11902)|
| 3:18:27| This is one reason I've heard before is like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| why should we have a right to stop a child from being born?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| Well, I can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11914)|
| 3:18:35| It's too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11915)|
| 3:18:36| The burden is too great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| Look at my life, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| But how many people, right, have been born into adverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| conditions and then survived through that, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11923)|
| 3:18:48| made it through and led a healthy and vibrant life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11928)|
| 3:18:53| Another one, another one, right, that having to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11933)|
| 3:19:01| like making, having someone have a child is somehow against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11941)|
| 3:19:05| women, which I don't find that helpful because it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11945)|
| 3:19:10| well, think about how many of the unborn are women, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11950)|
| 3:19:13| more than like at least half of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| So I say give them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| And so it's in light of these things that I say tonight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11957)|
| 3:19:21| I just ask you to support policies that give all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11961)|
| 3:19:25| unborn Knoxvillians a chance at life in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| Council members, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| And without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-221004?start=11973)|
