| 0:00:55| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=58)|

| 0:01:25| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| It's no secret that Knoxville is hitting records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| in terms of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| and so that's a good sign of why we live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| and why others want to build here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| both in commercial and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| So with that, it's important that we maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| quality development and efficient development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| and again, we rely on city staff to guide the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| So we will rely on you to guide the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| of the presentation today and our session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| But to kick us off, I think Mayor Kincannon is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| If you'd like to say a few words before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| Turn it on there. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Thank you, Vice Mayor Smith and members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| and members of our development services team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| I just wanted to say thank you to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| because improving development services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| has been something I pledged to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| when I first ran for mayor in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| and of course sometimes you think it will maybe take a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| or maybe a year and a half, but it's complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| and we have used outside consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| and we've increased our staff and done IT solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| and all of these things would not have been possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| without the focus and support of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| And so I just want to thank you for your persistence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| and your support, and this is important to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| not just for developments of commercial and other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| but also to address our housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| We want to make sure that people can build more housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| in a way that's efficient and safe and responsive to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| So thank you for your support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| and I'm looking forward to having the team here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| share all the progress we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Grant, you'll kick us off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| As you make your way to the podium, I'll say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| One is we know that there's a developer roundtable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| and they provide continual input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| and so I applaud the administration for establishing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| and providing a venue for people that build a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| to provide a lot of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Residents provide input to us or feedback to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| for everything from commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| to single-family homes or additions to their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| so listening is a big part of shaping and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| And part of that, I want to give you particular kudos for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| and the team, for our workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| It's really important that we have time to prepare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| and so you all have set a new precedent for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| I'm going to give you the three pre-award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| which is three days before a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| you all delivered these materials for us to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| I saw Councilman Ryder had at least 50 questions planned as a result,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| so there's a catch to that, but generally I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and it really helps us have an informed discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| So thank you for that, and I'll turn the mic over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| It was our pleasure to provide that information in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| and really appreciate the opportunity to present to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| For real, it's a great opportunity for us to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| some of the progress we've made to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| and I'm going to be allowing our team to share this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| I'm going to make a few brief remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| but I'm going to sit down and be quiet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| and allow the folks that are really doing the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| most of the folks that are doing the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| to stand before you and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Again, thank you for your support of these initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| We've had unanimous support from Council for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| at least since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| I know it's just been individual support from each Councilmember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and the most recent budget amendment in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| was really a big help in getting us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Again, you mentioned the Developers' Roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| They've been a great resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| I used to be a member of it and got to join the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| and they've been a great resource along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| We continue to utilize that group for their feedback and assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| as we continue to make progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| But I'm going to introduce some members of our team here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| Chris Howley is our Deputy Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Curtis Williams, Development Chief in Engineering Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| Brian Berry, Deputy Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Timothy Markham, our other Deputy Director of Plans Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| I see Tom Clabo in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Of course, Cheryl Ball, our Chief Policy Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| Fiona McNally, our Government Relations Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| Anyway, I just want to thank our team for all their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| Again, I'm going to let them do most of the presenting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| But many others obviously played a part on our team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| and too many to list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| I've had to explain it's been like building an airplane while it's in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| We're trying to deliver a high level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| while we're digging into a lot of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| and making a lot of substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| So I really want to applaud them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| But Chris Howley, Timothy Markham, and Brian Berry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| are actually going to provide the presentation this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| We're going to talk about really four key areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| our process policy changes, our leadership and our staffing levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| some data and accountability metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| and then customer service and software improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| and then we'll talk a little bit about some future initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Obviously, we'll have plenty of time for Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| This isn't going to be a really long presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| but allow some time for some questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| But if at any time you have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| obviously feel free to interrupt and ask away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| With that, I'm going to turn things over to Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=433)|
| 0:07:24| Thanks, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| I wanted to start this evening and talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| about the Matrix Consulting Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| who evaluated the Development Services Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| and in November of 2022 provided us with a number of recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| and today I wanted to provide an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| So far, 60% of the recommendations that were made have been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| An additional 17% are in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| which accounts for 75% of the total recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Not only have we been working on the Matrix recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| but we've also implemented over a dozen additional changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| to the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| I wanted to go over some of those changes today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| which in part you have voted on at previous council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| as ordinance revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| But I thought it would be helpful to go over some of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| First one I wanted to talk about is our special pollution abatement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| This is part of our water quality program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| and its requirements that are related to specific land uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| particularly things like gas stations, grocery stores, and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| In this new process, we have eliminated the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| for water quality device easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| We recognize that uses are often temporary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| and temporary uses shouldn't necessarily have permanent easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| and so we've been able to eliminate that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| An additional change is we simplified the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| We basically have one single form that addresses all of the different uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| for commercial uses on a single form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| and uses a series of check boxes to select effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| the different type of on-site controls that will be used for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| The third modification that we made was regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| a maintenance agreement for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| It no longer has to be signed by the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| which has been an ongoing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Now it is signed by the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| The agreement also no longer is recorded at the Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| These changes have significantly eased the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| on property owners and tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| as well as simplified the overall process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| The next change I wanted to talk about is right-of-way closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Historically, permanent right-of-way closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| have typically taken around four months to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| That process is a pretty long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| as many developments, that's longer than the period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| that they are wanting to go through the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| We have made significant changes in streamlining that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| and those changes began on March 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| The most notable change is that we have removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| the NOx Planning Commission's recommendations from the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| The process still looks and feels the same from the customer's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Applications still start in the same way at NOx Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| The review of those closures still goes through NOx Planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| as well as City Department staff, the same as it always has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| However, now, after staff recommendations for approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| it goes directly to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| This new process reduces the timeline from that four-month time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| to closer to two months, which that's definitely a big time saver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| We've also made some revisions to the platting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| Staff now has the authority to waive plat requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| for one- and two-family dwelling projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| So far, we have found that these changes help about three customers a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| saving them both time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Where plats are still needed, there is a new, more simple process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| using a site plan survey option, which is kind of what I call a plat light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| It, again, can save the customers time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| For commercial projects where platted easements are needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| we have moved this requirement, which used to be at the beginning of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| before a building permit was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| It's now at the end of the process prior to a Certificate of Occupancy being issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| again, cutting out a notable time constraint in the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| This ordinance was updated last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| and we've had a lot of positive feedback since these changes were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Updates to the zoning ordinance were also made last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Three changes were made to the off-street parking standards section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| One of them involved landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| that were modified to create flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| for the redevelopment of projects with existing parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| This change promotes fair and equitable redevelopment standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| An additional change dealt with the expansion of existing parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Now existing parking lots can be continued with the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| that were in the original parking lot in the expanded section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| This uniformity can create a safer and more functional parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| The third modification was in the bike parking requirements for the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| There's often many challenges in trying to find a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| to provide bike parking for proposed developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| just due to the constrained land and the zero setback nature of the developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| The new standard allows for flexibility in many spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| and in the number of spaces that are needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| and it's based on the individual site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| As expected, these changes have helped reduce the number of variances that we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| Next I want to talk about substantial investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| This is often referred to as the stormwater 50% rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| where certain redevelopment requirements come into play at an investment threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| Three modifications were made to reduce the impact of this rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| The first one is we adopted a substantial investment exclusion list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| to ease that impact, and it's things like sprinkler systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| fire flow lines, asbestos removal, or other types of remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| Landscaping or public improvements are included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| such as a turn lane or a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Those are no longer included in meeting that investment threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| We've also reduced the timeline for tracking these investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| and it's now at a five-year window of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| The third change is we eliminated the requirement for these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| whose investments are valued under $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| These changes have significantly reduced the impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| especially to smaller projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| Finally I want to talk about fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| which was probably the most significant change that we've had recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| The old process was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Previous fees were often based on widgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| the number of outlets, the number of plumbing fixtures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| how many acres you have in your development, how many lots you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| Each of the multiple permit types, including building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| site development permits, construction general permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| special pollution abatement permits, and right-of-way permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| each had their own fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| The new process is simplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| It's based on the valuation of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| and they're grouped within value ranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| making the prediction a lot easier to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| We've also created a fee calculator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| to help provide estimates at the beginning of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| To simplify things further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| we've eliminated the engineering review fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| as well as the plans review and inspections licensing fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| We will also be eliminating the covenant recording fee on May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| All of these changes have helped streamline the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| One of the most important aspects of this new fee schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| is that it was structured to help cover the costs of additional staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| as well as needed software improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| With that, I'll turn it over to Timothy Markham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| to talk about that staff as well as additional updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=881)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you, Chris, and thank you, Council, for having us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| If you got this three days ago, I've only added 21, 22 slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| so it's not going to take much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| No, thank you, Chris, for highlighting some –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| just a joke, I didn't add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you for highlighting some updates that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| to our development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| To implement these processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| and really get into the items that we just discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| and work to overall improve our efficiency and effectiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| we focused very heavily on staff improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| People is the asset that we've spent the most time and investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| and energy on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| From my first position here in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| Weed Eaton Parks in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| to my current position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| I've always felt the support of management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| my crew leaders, team leaders, everybody that I've worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| and I think that's really important in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| that we have that support, and we're building that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Getting a chance to build strong leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| that represents our staff is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| and being a part of that, helping to develop that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| and that leadership role, it means the world to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| so I'm very excited to get to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| To get into these couple of leadership improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| that we've had, let's go down the list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| First is Chris Howley was appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Deputy Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Chris, his role is to aid Director Clabo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| in matters, especially those into the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| He has many years involved in the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| and has a lot of knowledge that can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| His role frees up Director Clabo to work with higher level positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| in other parts of the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Curtis Williams was promoted to our Engineering Planning Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| His role organizes and oversees the inspection crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| and the plans review crew on the engineering side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| I've had a chance to work with and actually for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| both of these gentlemen since 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| is when I moved to engineering at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| and so I've had a lot of years getting to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I've really gotten to learn that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| an excellent management style that's very, very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| and helps guide those that work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| So I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| It's been excellent to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| On the plans review and inspection side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I was appointed to the Deputy Director position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| I share that role with Brian Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| who you'll talk to here or hear from in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Brian has expertise in the planning and zoning world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| and administrative side of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| I bring more expertise in the building codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| trades codes, and the inspection side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| field inspection experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| and so that dual role right there frees up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Director Aarons to actually address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| a lot more high level issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| issues that are getting much more political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| than the day-to-day that we're experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| So Brian and I share that role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| and it's absolutely wonderful to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| We promoted Aaron Skates to the Plans Review Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| This was a role that was actually recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| by the Matrix Evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| I think it was a Deputy Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| potentially is what they had called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| but the title, neither here nor there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| it's a role that helps our Building Chief, Jim Tente,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| split the roles of the 16 inspection staff that he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| and the three plans reviewers full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| There was getting to be a lot of people to manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| so Aaron takes over that plans review world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| His background with some of the private sector plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| and then his experience as a combination inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| and working in the city is invaluable to our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| He's really been a leader in taking over that role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| and helping continue it on for how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| And then one of those that we did promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| to a plans examiner position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| a combination two, is Greg Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Greg has been a combination inspector for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I've gotten the chance to work alongside him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Real quick, if you don't mind me sharing a little quick story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| I have stood on the steps and watched Greg Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| hold his code book a la Sunday morning preacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| and stand there and just, he preaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| He loves the stuff and he gets into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| And having him as an asset that can get into the plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| side of it, really in the single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| one and two family, smaller local stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| his involvement with that is a great help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| to the community and our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| It's wonderful to have him promoted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| So all of these changes have really been implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| in the last six or so months with the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| and alongside those, those changes have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| a lot of additions to the rest of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Those additions that are shown on this slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| were positions that were approved by city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| and I can't thank you all enough for giving us that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| the assets that we needed and the people that we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| and actually helping develop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| On those positions, as you can see from the slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| we've got three engineering positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| two being an engineer and one a technician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Those have all been filled and are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| in process of training in various degrees of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| On the plans review and inspection side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| there's six total roles that we have five filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| We're very anxious to fill the sixth one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| but part of that leadership and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| is making sure that the new people have everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| that they're needed for training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| and for everything in support for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| So we have anxiously awaiting to fill the sixth position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| total that's on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Mr. Markham, so is filled red or green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Filled is the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| The green is the new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Of those new positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| five of those six green ones have been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| So the color doesn't indicate filled or not filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| It indicates new versus old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| And so it shows that we have a growing staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| I do want to bring out that this is not just adding more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| We took a step back and recognized that the addition of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| really did require us to reestablish roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| and see exactly what's going to help the community the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| One of the big changes is as an engineering technician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| their role now splits at some hybrid office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| some field position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Their role in the office is to take smaller single family plans reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| that are in their area that they're assigned to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| and complete that in total review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| and then inspect that project out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| So you have one person that has been involved with your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| from an engineering side all the way through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| and I think that's just a great improvement for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| because it really loses that separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| People can really get involved with their projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| The inspection side, the plans review and inspection side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| those inspectors have really gotten a chance to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| largely on cross-training in disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Adding those folks is not just 15 people that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| that do footing inspections now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Now we have people that we can cross-train and get out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| and really have a combination of inspectors that can get with one project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| and, again, see it through to the very end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| which is really helpful, especially to those that may not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| a design professional involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| It's smaller single families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| and I think that really has made an improvement in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| The last thing that I want to bring up is less tangible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| doesn't have a graph with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| doesn't have anything that can be represented necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| but it really is just about our culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| and about what we're trying to establish in this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| The promotion and the establishment of leadership positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| the adding of these positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| has made not only just an effective and efficient department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| but has provided a career path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| is inviting people to come into our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| to actually learn to grow and actually develop their skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| We have hopefully, with the addition of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| and the establishment of this leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| become more effective and helpful out in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| because we have the people to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| And then doing all that can really help us establish Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| as the standard and the benchmark for a safe, effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| efficient development community throughout the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| So with that being said, understanding the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| and the roles that our leadership has played has been very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| and thank you again very much for the support that you all give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| There's no way we could do it without you all working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| and getting these things passed, so I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| To discuss more about some of the customer service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| the demand and roles that we have, we have Brian Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1426)|
| 0:23:56| All right, thank you, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| So the slides that I'm going to walk you through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| are going to illustrate the importance and the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| of these new positions that Tim was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Let me get here to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| So the bar chart that you're seeing here on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| is the total number of inspections by month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| over the last two-and-a-half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| As you can see, the trend line shows a steady increase in inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| with a peak of about 2,545 in October of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| Plans review and inspections were committed to next-day inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| In the past, in order to do this, it's resulted in plan reviewers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| being pulled into the field for inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| and it created a backlog of plans review within our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| So the additional funding that was provided by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| for those six new inspector positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| has allowed for reviewers to remain in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| to complete plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| and I'll touch more on this impact here in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| So now that we have the number of inspectors that we needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| we turn to focus on a plans review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| So moving forward, what we've done is we've established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| an expectation for customers for plan review times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| So shown here are the four tiers of project types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| with associated benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| In the right column are the number of calendar days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| in which we will return either comments or an approval to an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| So as you can see, for example, a residential plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| would take seven days for us to return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| either a list of comments or approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Commercial is broken down into three tiers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| and those are based on project value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| So, for example, a commercial project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| that's less than $500,000 is a 14-day turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| Those between $500,000 and $20 million are 21 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| and projects that are over $20 million are around 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| So with the six new inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| that are taking over the inspection volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| with reviewers remaining in the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| how has this impacted our plan review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| Well, in the last four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Plans Review and Inspection has completed 1,422 plan reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| for an average of about 17 reviews each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| So the breakdown of this is about 48% residential, 52% commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| As you're aware, commercial reviews typically take more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| as they're more involved with site work, stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| and traffic impact assessments, as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| So when we apply these benchmarks over the last four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| how have we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| Well, across the board, we're showing improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| So the bar chart here shows the average number of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| for plan review each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| We're starting with December of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| working through March of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| And again, these are the turnaround times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| for comments or approval back to an applicant each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| So the four project tiers are shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| along with the associated benchmarks in black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| So for example, a residential plan review dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| from an average of 23 days in December to 10 days in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| For a commercial project that was less than $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| it dropped from 24 to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Projects between $500,000 and $20 million fell from 41 to 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| and those over $20 million from 62 to 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| Now, the number of projects over $20 million each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| range from about four to eight projects in the queue for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| The large numbers shown here from December and January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| are reflective of many variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| but ultimately it's a need for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| However, the trend is moving in the right direction now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| with dedicated staff to review plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| And so while the tasks of inspecting and plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| are two key components of what we do in our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| the third is customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| And I want to talk a little bit about some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| customer service initiatives that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I'm sorry, I don't know the protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| If I'm supposed to jump in, Tommy looked at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| The vice mayor looked at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| My question, because I'll forget by the time we get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| I can go back to any side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| I'm making my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| So when we're talking about the cross-training of inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| and that leaves people in the office to do plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| I don't know if there's a quantitative answer to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| but is that cross-training helping with consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| and more rapid approval of the entire project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Because one of the things I used to hear is one inspector would go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| for one thing and then there would be a different inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Does an inspector kind of stay with a project so that there's consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| in what they're hearing from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| Of those new folks that are not fully certified, qualified quite yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| as they continue to grow and develop, that is the goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| is that they get their one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| The beauty of the additional staff is it allows our building chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| to go spend time with the inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| which he was roped into inspections himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| and plans review for the longest time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I just think as we're moving into customer service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| that's a big component of the customer service is knowing what's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| and feeling confident that if I do this, there won't be another this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| Talking a little bit about customer service initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| 311 department has been a great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| They've handled the 70 calls a day average that our department receives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| and in those calls, they've been able to assist in answering around 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| of them before they route them to the appropriate person or department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| So we as a department will continue to train and help 311 with understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| our process with the goal of seeing that share increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Plans review and inspection has also reopened the front desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| on a part-time basis with available staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| The goal, long-term goal, is to provide a front desk staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| that is there throughout the day each day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| to answer customer questions as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Another initiative is we're planning to bring back the expedited review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| So what these are is these are projects that qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| They can bring plans in for review with the goal of receiving a building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| that same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Right now we're working through our 100% digital online submittal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| to make sure that the technology is feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and we'll make this seamless and smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Mr. Perry, could you just give us a couple of examples of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| that would get a same-day permit with the expedited review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, those are going to be projects that are interior renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| that don't necessarily include engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Repair and replace, like swap my toilet out, swap my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| That's already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| It's like if it's a new tenant moving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| and they want to make some changes where they're redesigning the interior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| we can sit down and walk through it with them, review it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| More like commercial-type projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Oh, more likely commercial than residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| So lastly, something we currently offer and will continue to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| is every Monday and Thursday for customers to schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| a free-of-charge pre-submittal project review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| And what this does is it allows applicants to take advantage of feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| on a project from staff before they submit for plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| Software, as we've heard, is another key component to customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| Avero Advisors, they were brought on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| to assess our current software setup and permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| And as you can see from the screenshot of our current online permitting homepage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| there are 12 tiles to choose from at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| And so customer feedback to us on this has expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| that it requires too many clicks to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| It's very text-heavy, and overall it's cumbersome to navigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| So what we have here is a draft permitting website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1966)|
| 0:32:54| that condenses these down into six tiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| And I'll give you an example here that will kind of illustrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| Plans, Review, and Permits tile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| What this will do is applicants can now easily identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| the type of permit they're going for based on the first click,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| whether it's a residential or a commercial project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| So if I'm an individual and I expand the accordion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| and I need to do a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| and the next click I'm into the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| So we've tried to streamline and to reduce that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| and we feel like we're accomplishing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Again, this is a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| It's not live at the moment, but it will be coming live soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| Can I ask a question there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| So let's say I own a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| I'm not a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I'm just a homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| and I'm thinking about doing some upgrades to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And when you put this up there, I realize it's not there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| but I click on the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| I think there was one about updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Let's say I picked something that I don't actually need up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Like I have a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| but I really don't need a permit for it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Like there's no reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Am I going to get to a point where that gives me an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| and says, you don't need a permit for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| It's only for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Is that something that's going to be built in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| We're trying to incorporate that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| We currently experience that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| To give you an example, we don't require a building permit for a shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| It's under 200 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| And so these are things that we're trying to incorporate into the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| software so that it will recognize these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| and help applicants know through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Oh, and that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| I figured that's probably something you run into a bunch is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| oh, I actually don't need a permit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| and I'm spending a bunch of time and your time trying to figure that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| and you need to move on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| So I think that's a great thing to add in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I just wanted to make sure that was going to be something you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| thinking about to help people out because I think there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| misunderstandings and lack of information out there because it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2101)|

| 0:35:16| blink, blink, you don't need a permit, is there a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2116)|

| 0:35:25| some people get confused and think they do need a permit for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| when they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Right, that would be another example of where we're not going to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| a building permit for that, and we currently don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Right, but we wouldn't want them to waste their time and your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| staff's time, going through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| So is there like a quick FAQ, things you do and don't need a permit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| if it's not built into the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| So at the top of the – there's headers up here relative to policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| FAQs, and fast facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| That's definitely something we can build if we don't have it already is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| do I need a permit, and then list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Because building codes, if you dive into the building codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| they tell you what's exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| And the average person is going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| I'm just telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Which –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Or by the time we do –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| I would just think that would be a quick thing is here's ten things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| you don't need a permit for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| You guys know what's commonly submitted, and I just wanted to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| on your too many clicks thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| When I was at Pellissippi, that's what the students said to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| They go, library lady, this is too many clicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I'm just going to use Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| So those are the folks that are up and comers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Just remember, too many clicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Too many clicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| Too many clicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2204)|
| 0:36:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Let's see if I can get –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| One of the other things that Vero is going to do is they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| provide an assessment of our internal software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| So, for example, we use Acela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| It is a software that houses our permit records internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| They're going to take a look at this as well as all the other softwares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| that interact with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| They're going to look for better integration, ways that they can improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| workflow, as well as best management practices in order to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| the internal side of our permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| They're also going to look to expand our reporting capabilities for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| and use of all the data we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| Future initiatives, other initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| First one there is a fast track review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| What this does is it provides customers an option to pay an additional fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| for a third-party review on projects that they may have a time constraint on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| So it will allow for an even faster turnaround time if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| The summer plans review and inspection will look to hold public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| towards the adoption of the 2024 International Code Council building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| So the tentative schedule at this moment is to bring this before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| in the fall with a first quarter 2025 implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| So plans review and inspection will continue to expand outreach opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| to professional groups, neighborhoods, along with creation of workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| where users will have the option and opportunity to attend these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| and walk through the city online permitting process with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| to understand it better and to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| We also look at this as an opportunity for feedback from these groups as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| The addition of benchmarks and metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| We'll use this data we collect in the creation of a development activity report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| that's focused solely on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| This would be beneficial, we think, to a variety of groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| So finally here, as we transition to the question and answer portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| of this presentation, staff certainly would appreciate and value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| any of council's feedback on measurables to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| into the development activity report along with answering any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| So this concludes our update on development services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| And staff at this point will open it to workshop to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you, Director Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you, everybody who's participated in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| We have some questions from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Just turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| I'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Just wanted to follow up on a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| When we were talking about the pollution abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| the eliminated easements, I guess I just wanted to follow up on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| a little bit, Mr. Howley, about obviously we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| we continue to have good water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And what I got from the presentation was this is for temporary uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| Can you tell me a little bit more about what the temporary use might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| and how that elimination might affect or not affect at all water quality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| There's really two different types of water quality aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| that we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| One is a first flush requirement, which is a general water quality requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| that affects any development that has more than a half an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| of impervious area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| And those are ones that are permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| They follow that for eternity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| And so the obligations associated with that are to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| these water quality facilities in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And so they have maintenance agreements that follow the ownership of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| They're recorded in the Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| And so they are all tied to the lineage of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| and that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| And then there are certain ones where you might have a bookstore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| turn into a restaurant, or a restaurant turn into a bookstore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| and you would have to provide water quality units to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| to convert that into a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| But if you convert it back to a bookstore, that water quality unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| is no longer required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| And to have a lot of ties to the chain of title that obligate the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| for maintenance, long-term maintenance for a device that's no longer needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| if the use changes, is why those requirements were taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| And from a management standpoint, having them on the first flush ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| that follow regardless of the use, those need to follow because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| going to be for eternity, and it's easy for us to keep track of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| because we have a permanent record of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| With the uses, the special pollution abatement, they actually have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| And the permit expires every five years and has to be renewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| and so it really turns it almost into an operational standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| So we have a group of folks that manage that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| and so they do inspections to make sure things are properly done on a cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| And so because we have this kind of a post-construction program in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| it makes it unnecessary to have the doubled-up documents that may not be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| at some point in the history of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| So if I understood it correctly, then it's I have a use that I've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| got approval for, it changes, you get maybe updated requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| but then I go back to the original use, I don't need to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| through the original process because I've already established that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| and I've moved forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Is that basically right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Can you say that again? I'm not sure I followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| I'm not sure I got it right either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| What I heard you say was say you were a bookstore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| and you turned it into a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| So I obviously qualified for water quality under the bookstore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| then I moved on to restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| I have to get everything approved for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Well, then I go back to a bookstore later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| That's what you mean by the temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| And I don't need to go back through the same process I did for the bookstore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| because I've already done it for the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| You wouldn't have to go through that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| It would essentially be that the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| the special pollution abatement permit that is an operational permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| when the use changes, that would basically expire that permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| and the water quality obligations are no longer necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| because they are specifically related to that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| And trash, oils, and greases are restaurant use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| and so there's a special water quality unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| that addresses those specific types of pollutants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| and you don't tend to see those on a bookstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| And so it's no longer necessary to have that maintenance protocol in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| whether the device is physically there or if it's removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| Maintenance of it is no longer a needed item because of the use change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| So I would just be duplicating the same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| and that's what you've removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Now, if I had something that had a more profound impact on water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| that I might have leaks of certain things and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| with whatever my use is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| this is not giving less water quality from that type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| That stuff is going to continue to be monitored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| and you're not going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| You get where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| So that's more of, I call it, part of our enforcement program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| as opposed to our operations program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| The operations is more about incidentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| When you have a restaurant and you're moving grease from the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| over to the bin and you have something that drips out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| when it rains and that goes into these water quality units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| that prevents that from getting into the downstream streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| But if you have a pipe that busts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| and you're leaking some other type of product out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| that's not what these devices are designed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| and we typically go through an enforcement action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| if there's an impact from those types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| But I'll also say that these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| sometimes they protect even in those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| For instance, if something leaked 100 gallons of fuel out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| a lot of these units would be able to hold 100 gallons of fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| So it could be remediated before it ever got off site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| even though that wasn't the intent of that device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| that is an opportunity for those devices to be able to manage that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I'm piggybacking on Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| I think basically what I understand is that type of permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| follows with the type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| So even if it was bookstore, became a restaurant, became a dress shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| you still would need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| It's not the original use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| it's just the type of business that would require a certain type of permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| and that's what you track based on the type of business, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Yes, and it is a select group of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| I gave a few examples, but there are some others that are less common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| But most of these water quality aspects have to do with things that float.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| So it's usually something that produces oils, greases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| and trash and things of those natures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| But from my way of thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| the permit just is tied to whatever the required usage is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| that makes you get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| And every five years you have to have the permit renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| If you're not doing that anymore, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Now my next question, and I don't know who can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| So we talked about the front desk customer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| I'm really big on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| I worked in a financial institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| They expected somebody at the front of the bank when you walked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| to give some questions, and so I'm really glad we're moving to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Is there any idea, or what's your goal for maybe getting that to full time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| I'm looking at, I don't know who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| I'm staring at the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| You can fight for it or I don't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| As quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| But, I mean, is that within the next 90 days, six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| I'd say six months would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| That's your goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| To have it done by six months, and sooner if possible is what I'm sure you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| As we get folks in and trained and staffed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| But you're aggressively recruiting people all the time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| It's budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| The money's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| That's not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| It is finding the right person, and so sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| It's not a money issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| It's a finding the person, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| And then the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| What is an estimated, I'm not going to hold you to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| Hold Brian to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| Is our hope within six months, a year, sooner preferably?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Sure, the expectations are for it to go live Sunday at 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| Well, now you buried the lead when you had your whole report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| That's the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| This Sunday of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Not just any given Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Well, I mean, so we could say all things considered, within the next 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| we expect it to really be functioning, and that's a nice thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| One of the things that we've done, too, is we've brought in end users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| We had them sit down with the consultants as well as ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| To say it's too many clicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| And to walk through the new site to provide us some feedback based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| their familiarity with the way it's set up now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| and how they would like to see things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| And so it was helpful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And I hope you understand that the reason I'm asking about expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| is not putting anybody on the hot seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| It's just I think the community people, you know, Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| we've talked about this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| I mean, it's been this drumbeat that it's hard and it's long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| and I think the fact that we're making progress is really great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| and an idea of we're closing in very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| It should be before the end of the year is, you know, if not by fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| is very encouraging, and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| because I think that really will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Our commitment, I mean, this meeting, this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| I mean, this is not a victory lap by our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| I mean, but we want to – the message we want to convey is we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| a lot of progress and that it's measurable progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| So we've got some benchmarks now that we've – some expectations we've set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| for ourselves and showing how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| We're not meeting them all yet, and we're very open about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| but we are making some progress and we're trending in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| And that's just since December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Again, the budget amendment was approved in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| We've gotten these new positions on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| We've got a leadership team in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Within the first quarter of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| So just within the first quarter, we're trending in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| and, you know, we've been pushing our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| They've been pushing their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| I've been pushing this team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| You all have been pushing us, which is good, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| And the expectations are high, but we feel confident we're going to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| some real results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| We're starting to hear – we're starting to get some anecdotal feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| and the talk from the developer roundtable, our partners we talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| in the community are starting to see a little bit of a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| But, you know, I think by this summer, the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| you're going to see we can do another one of these workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| or issue – give you all some reports and data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| The data – we're doing some improvements to our website with software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| but what's really helpful is the stuff on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| If you notice, the data we have only goes back to December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| That's when we started being able to collect it and report it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| We just haven't been able to do that in the past with the capabilities we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| So we have these benchmarks for the plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| Those are benchmarks we can control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| We can control the amount of time we spend reviewing a set of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| There's additional information in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| So, you know, for example, it's not going to take seven days necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| for you to get a residential building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| It may take longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| We're going to track that information as well so we can give our customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| our clients some expectations of, hey, here's how long I can expect this to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| and depending on the level of quality of design we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| So, for example, if we get a bad set of plans, of commercial plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| which never happens, I'm sure, but let's just say hypothetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| we get a bad set of drawings, you know, it may take multiple review cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| So, again, that gives us an opportunity to put some more accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| on the development community and the design community to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| we're getting good plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| And we have some checklists to ensure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| We're communicating that on the front end so we're getting good plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| We're turning them around quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| They're turning them around quickly so we can get the permit approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3142)|
| 0:52:28| and they can get to work and they get their financing lined up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| and they can execute the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| The other point I want to make, we didn't have a real big metric for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| but it's a huge metric that we've been meeting for a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| is next day inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| And that's been at the expense of our plans review time frames,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| but that's a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Not a lot of municipalities are doing that or meeting that kind of benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| That is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| And that's a big deal when you're out in the field coming from construction world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| I mean, you've got subcontractors on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| You can't wait three or four days to get a plumbing inspection or mechanical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| That's a really big deal, and that helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Again, the plans review process has been a longer process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| but when projects get started, we've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| contractors have been able to execute projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| and we have not held up those kinds of issues in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| And then I know my time's about up, but all I wanted to say is thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| I mean, this is really hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| It's been fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| It's a lot thrown at you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| and I know that the city is the easy person to always be the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| And I think this kind of data reporting really helps transparency across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| entire industry about how things are actually going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| and where things are in the cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| I appreciate the speed with which you're working and the transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| and I think it's going to turn the narrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| But more importantly, it's going to help us do business a lot better for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| constituents and the people who want to invest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Okay, I don't really have 50 questions, but I'm probably more attentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| I don't have that kind of time, so I won't do that to you guys tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| But I have enough questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| I don't know where to start, so we won't get to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| A couple of things for the benefit of answering questions for constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| So first off, thank you guys, and I appreciate Mr. Markham bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| We don't know what your barriers are and what you need to do to answer the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| until you bring them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| So happy to support what you guys need, because it is my belief and what I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| to constituents is it's not that you're trying to not get things turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| It's about the barriers that we're working with, whether that's software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| whether that's manpower, whether that's your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| or any other city department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| In my experience and my time on council and even before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| it's not that city employees don't want to do a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| and turn around and give a great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| It's just sometimes we don't have the manpower and the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| If we were running 24-7 like a Walmart, maybe we could turn things around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| in all departments faster, better, quicker, but that's not what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| So that little soapbox spiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| Mr. Howley, to put you on the hot seat, some of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| I was so excited to see a slide about SPAP and some specific things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| that I have lived experience with, which is the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| and having the owner of the building sign and all kinds of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| My partner on my building was like, no, we're not signing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| That's for the so-and-so to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| So we have that wrangle back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| So SPAP, I've had constituents say that other cities don't do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| or that they have more exceptions for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Like you mentioned half-acre parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| We have a lot in the older parts of the city, Magnolia, Broadway, Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| maybe some of the South Knoxville areas, where you have really small parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| Some of them are mostly under half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| But I guess what was pointed out to me or questioned to me is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| some cities the limiting factor is an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| So I didn't know is that something that was considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| What's the argument against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| I'm sure you've heard all the arguments that have been brought to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| as to why and what, because I think some of the requests have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| throw the baby out with the bathwater and just don't do this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| So we won't get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| What do you want to say about SPAP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| I'll try to give you not the long answer, but in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| it really depends on what communities you're trying to compare to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| The city of Knoxville, we're one of four, what we call a Phase 1 NPDES,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| which is a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| which is our stormwater permit that we get from TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| and it's a permit that they get from EPA to meet these water quality standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| There's four Phase 1 communities in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| and I'm not sure how many Phase 2s there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| but everybody else that has a stormwater permit is a Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| So that's Knox County and all these other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| UT has their own Phase 2 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| TDOT has their own Phase 2 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| And then you talk about Blount, Alcoa, Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| All these different communities have these Phase 2 stormwater permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| What's it do for us to be a Phase 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| So Phase 1 was implemented first, and so we were implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| We started in 1993, and we had to be fully implemented in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| And we have what we call an individual stormwater permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| And so our stormwater criteria doesn't look like the other four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| or the other three, which is Chattanooga, Nashville, and Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Each one is individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| So in those early days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| a depiction of what we wanted to do to meet these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| So we were basically given performance criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| How do you want to meet them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| And those decisions were made at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| And so we can only really be compared to those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| These Phase 2s came along, I think, probably about 8 to 10 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| And so they're in a whole different cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| And theirs are more what I would call a general permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| They're told what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| We're not told what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| We just have a performance criteria that we have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I'll also say one of the challenging things for us is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| we're the only one of the big four communities that our permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| that we're operating from was a 2005 permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| and they're supposed to be renewed every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| If they don't renew it, you just work off your last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| and we're still working off our 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| All the other three have gotten more up-to-date and modern permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| And there's a variety of reasons why we've been told we haven't gotten that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and some of them are litigation in some of these other big cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| that delayed these permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| We're told they're working on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| The internal joke is we're going to get our new permit on July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| but I've been saying that for 18 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| So at some point, do you really believe the timeline that we're going to receive that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| But there is a comment period where they've started addressing some of this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| And during that process, we have the opportunity to talk about different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| Some other options could be to, instead of having the special pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| and pavement permits for what TDEC would call hotspots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| you could just make everybody do a SPAP light and then just have one version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| But that didn't seem like the most appropriate way to address those target pollutants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| But there are other ways to achieve that water quality standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| But we bought into this concept early, and to change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| we would have to show an equal or better pollutant removal concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| to switch to something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| It's not about just doing away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| It's about proposing something that is an alternate that is equal or better to TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| and them agreeing with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| So when people say they don't do it this way in other cities, that is factual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| So it's not that we want to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| It's just that we're different because we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| and the cities that get compared to are Nashville, Chattanooga, Asheville, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| which I understand is a different state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| So that is an apples to oranges issue at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| That's a very complicated situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| And some of those communities that sound like we don't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| if I told you some of the things they did that we don't do, you'd be like, oh, that's worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| For instance, one of the things that we commonly see is these water quality devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| that are a large tank, and they kind of have a swirling motion to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Stuff floats on the top and separates these pollutants out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| In some of these other communities, they require cartridge filters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| that are more like water treatment facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| and the rate or the cost of those facilities are exponential compared to what ours are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| And ours can be vacuumed out with a standard vac truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| and theirs, these cartridges have to be vac'd out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| and then these cartridges have to be replaced like every year or every 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| And the cost of that maintenance is significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| and we're not under that level of requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| And so to some degree, we might be in better shape with the regs as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| but again, July 1st, maybe we'll know more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| So I'm going to wrap this up, and this is the only thing I want to ask a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| because I see Councilwoman Helsley is waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Take all the time you need, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| No, no, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| No, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| So if somebody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| it's easier and I don't have to do as many things on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| to satisfy our SPAP requirements for Knoxville versus, say, Atlanta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| like I think that's an example that's been given to me, but I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| What I think I hear you saying is what we might be requiring somebody to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| that costs them $10,000 on the front end to fill in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| renovate a blighted property here or a vacant unused property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| might be costing in another city more money on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| or the maintenance end because they have to get some special filter cartridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| and something, something, something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| That's certainly possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| In some communities like Atlanta's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| one where a lot of their systems are combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| they don't go to the storm drain system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| They go to the sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| And so the need for water quality isn't there because it goes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| it's like if we could send our stormwater to KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| they're just treating it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| We're paying for this big facility down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| But in our community, they're separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| which is really the better way to go because of overflow issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| But because we're draining directly to the creeks, streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| and ultimately the river, we do have a water quality requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| that tries to address those target pollutants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Councilwoman Helsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| Since I'm the newest member of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| I don't have like firsthand experience of how sluggish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| or clunky the old system was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| So I just want to thank you all for making it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| because it sounds like you have improved the matrix a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| And I'm going to come down and build me a house if that's okay, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| So in your system, I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| So thank you for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| I have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| One is around the service level goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3840)|
| 1:04:09| The benchmark is the only kind of metric before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Mr. Rosenberg, you mentioned other metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| Are there other metrics that you want to try to measure maybe that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| don't have the data for now, maybe people withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| abandon rates, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| what other types of metrics would you like to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Yeah, I think I mentioned the total cycle, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| the total cycle from application to permit is data we want to just track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| It's data we want to track and report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Again, we don't have as much control over it because there's back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| and there's what we get submitted to us and the number of cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| But that's still information that's helpful to know and helpful to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| you know, how many, for example, on a residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| how many cycles is it and how can we look at reducing the number of cycles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| What better information can we provide on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| One thing, Vice Mayor, we've talked about is customer service, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| Like there's data related to customer service that we want to solicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| and get so we can measure how we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| what level of satisfaction from our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| That's all we're getting right now is qualitative, anecdotal information, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| We're getting either e-mails or complaints or phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| having a more systematic way where we can get some feedback from our clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| on how they felt about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Again, how do we do that in an easy way that's very simple and easy to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| whether it's a follow-up text message or a quick e-mail, getting some follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Again, we're getting feedback through, you know, our development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| We talked about outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| That's a really big thing we haven't had enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| we haven't spent a lot of time doing, had enough time to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| because, again, everyone's been very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| But as we get more staff and get more settled in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| doing more outreach to various trade organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| so meeting with, you know, Associated Builders and Contractors and AGC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| and AIA, all the different acronyms, trade organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| getting with them and getting some feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| obviously sharing information like this that we're sharing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| but getting some feedback on how we're doing, how is the process going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| Again, that's not data, that's not quantitative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| but the customer service data, the full cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| Brian, what other metrics have we talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| One of the things we can do is we can break down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| based on department review times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| so we can look at, you know, how is zoning doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| compared to the building department from a review time standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| As Grant said, just generally overall review time it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| for certain levels of projects to get through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| One follow-up question, those current SLAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| the clock starts over once a review comes back to the applicant, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| I mean these average times that I'm looking on are based on not just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| initial response or approval, but there are multiple phases, as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| where you provide comments back to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| they have to make changes, send it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| The clock starts over after the initial comment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| So it starts as soon as we receive the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| and submit them to the staff for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Just another comment before I go to Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| You know, one of the things that I hear a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| particularly for the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| a district that's under construction quite a bit, in a good way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| is just neighbors don't know when the lane is going to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| or the crane is allowed to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| And so what that kicks off is why are they still working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| Should they still be working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| And so then I've got to text Peter at night and ask him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| what time should they stop working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| And then you've got to ask the developer, why are you still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| And also just when does the lane open back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| I have to get to the store and I've got this crazy route to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| and I can do it for a little while, but when's the end, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| And so I've talked with everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| mostly everybody in this room about this challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| and constantly brainstorming because I don't know enough to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| when to email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| And so each department has their own kind of dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| So one of the things I've experienced over the past couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| is a couple developers that have done a good job of providing either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| weekly or biweekly updates to the relevant neighborhood because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| know when the permits expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| They know when they might ask for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| They know when their crew is going to be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| And so one of the things that I would ask of you is to reinforce with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| commercial particularly or multi-family, multi-residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| any developer that's going to impede a right-of-way or disrupt the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| of the neighborhood is to communicate to the neighborhood that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| in as a good neighbor what their plans are, what progress they're making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| how much longer will it take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| And I've experienced that from a few developers recently that have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| a good job and it just goes a long way and it saves a bunch of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| and phone calls particularly for somebody, me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| that doesn't have any clue about when details are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| So my ask is that you encourage every developer that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| particularly at a residential area or even commercial so they can plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| and know how long to grit their teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| And I think it goes a long way when people know when the horizon is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| So just help reinforce that with developers because I do think that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| right place for that to come from, not because that's a burden for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| but just they're a neighbor and they need to tell their neighbor what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| their plans are and keep them up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| So help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| That's good feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| That's something to think about too and how we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| particularly for the very large projects where there's going to be a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| concrete pour at 3 a.m. or road closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| Road closures is something we actually are evaluating how we permit those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| how we enforce and regulate construction road closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| So that's another mechanism we may have an opportunity to kind of encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| and foster some outreach communication from the developer and contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| I think it applies to general public awareness is that people do a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| better responding to change if they know what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Yeah, so looking back at one of the slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| the progress report on the matrix recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| you have complete 59 percent in process, 17 percent, and future 23 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| Would it be possible for us to get maybe a list of what those are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Not right this moment in this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| That seems lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| What's complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| What's in process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| What's put off to the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| I'd be happy to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| It was a lot of information to try to put on a slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| It was like 72 recommendations total, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| And three days in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Yeah, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Can we have a detailed progress report on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Yeah, I'd be happy to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| And I have another staff question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Would you define that just for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Special pollution abatement permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| You got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Okay, I'm trying to, in a nutshell, a constituent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| If you are developing a restaurant in an older part of town on a small parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4310)|
| 1:12:00| and you happen to be, you have no parking because you don't have any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| and let's say you have either the correct zoning, DK, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| or you have a no parking variant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| So you have no parking lot, it's street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| So the SPAP requirements are only calculated and required to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| I may mess this up, but follow along with me, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| if you can follow along, only apply to kind of the area where the restaurant is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| The footprint of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| And to go along with that is if we were in a plaza shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| and we have one restaurant that comes in one slot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| we're worried about that restaurant and kind of the parking area out front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| that kind of would be associated with those tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| We're not worried about the whole complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| We're worried about that specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| So in the no parking, it would be the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| and the surrounding components that might be the pollutant-driven stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| So if you have a building that is, say, it has no parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| and it's only street parking, and it has a zero parking variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| when you calculate SPAP, it's really the footprint of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| You're not doing parking lot calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| But if I own a building and I happen to have a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| I have more SPAP requirements because I have water runoff, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| So it costs me more to develop that because I have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| So if I happen to have a building with a zero parking requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| I'm in a much better shape because I don't have to do all these other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| because I'm not trying to remediate water runoff off parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| From a water quality perspective, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| So when my constituents, I'm not talking about builders and developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| my neighbors, I'm trying to hypothetically follow along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| with my developer constituents issue because their point was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| the downtown restaurants don't have to spend all this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| to remediate and do SPAP for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| because the city is providing parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| So when my constituents, my neighbor constituents are like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| why don't we have more restaurants here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Part of the issue is some of the stuff around us doesn't get developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| to restaurants because the burden of scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| you got to be able to sell enough burgers and beers to be able to offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| the cost of $10,000 plus or one person said $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| Maybe they might have been exaggerating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| I really hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Because not that big of a footprint of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| But there's a burden of scale that's keeping some of our properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| from getting developed because they have to meet all these SPAP requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| because they're providing their parking whereas, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| a downtown restaurant doesn't have that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| There is definitely some truth to what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| There are other aspects that I mentioned before in a restaurant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| and I've seen this at a McDonald's and you see where somebody's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| a grease bin that they roll back and forth to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| and you can tell exactly which path and which door they went in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| because they're dripping goo the whole way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| Sorry for that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| So when we talk about downtown, where is their grease traps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| And all the restaurants downtown with the exception of two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| that have a grease component to them, where are their grease traps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| They're required to have them and a lot of them are inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| So some of them are in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| To clean them out, they have to close the building down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| so they can clean them out because the smell is so significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| But they put them inside the building because they're obligated to have them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| and that's part of the sewer system but it never gets into the storm system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| because it's all internal to the building, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| So there are other things when you talk about downtown that are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| to mitigate some of the same impacts that we're trying to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| on a more traditional restaurant site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| So the requirements there are is about where the grease is moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| across the parking lot or it's more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| It's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| I'll give you a variety of different examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| But the grease, how it moves across the parking lot, that is a big one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| that is directly related to a lot of restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| Grease control is a major problem from those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| But it's also trash, those kind of pollutants which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| when you think about fast food, how many garbage cans are overflowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| how many wrappers are floating down, how much foam and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| do you end up down at the creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| And these booms that we have down at the entrance to all the creeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| as they approach the river, all of those things are part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| what I call a more traditional restaurant setup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| where you have a parking lot that you have people that are going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| that are hanging out, that are left something on the top of their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| that are spilling something, that are pouring their coke out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| and it's more concentrated at that specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| Going back to staffing for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| the council was very happy to supplement the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| so that you guys could hire because we had reports saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| that you needed more staffing, and I was glad that we were able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| How did the hiring process go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Obviously, you got people hired in a pretty quick amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| but just can you give us a general sense of how it went?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| Timothy can probably speak to this more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| but it seems like we've, for some crazy reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| have found a lot of really good candidates who are racing through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| their certification tests ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| We incentivize that, so we give them bonuses if they get their certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| because then they can do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| But Timothy can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| I would give a lot of credit to the management staff before I got this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| not trying to take credit for what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| For people like Peter, Jim Tintay, who's our building chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| they were in these roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| They were the one really leading these interview processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| and they were able to not only take advantage of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| we have a lot of people moving from out of state to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| And that actually kind of helped us out because there's a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| that have all these certifications and have this desire that are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| from northern areas, moving south, coming from out west into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| And so we did have a higher number of that this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| but we also had a lot of local people that were able to work with Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| and with Jim to really understand, and they took the time to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| what they were actually doing for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| It wasn't as quick as the process went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| It wasn't rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| It gave them the chance to come back a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| and actually get involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| I think that's just a testament to we got the chance to take a breath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4750)|
| 1:19:18| see exactly what we needed, re-evaluate what we wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| and then actually had a really good list of people to go and get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| So it wasn't just filling in people like I was mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| to just more people throwing at the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| It was how are we going to fix this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| Let's find those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Luckily, those people applied also, but it was really just the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| in how we were doing that interview that led to, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| five of the six excellent positions that were filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| and those folks are really doing a bang-up job to fill that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| So you still have just one vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| I would add the comp plan, comp study from a few years ago helped as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| I mean, boosted the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| I mean, we've got competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| It's a good competitive pay position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| That's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| Then I wanted to go to the improving stats you talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| for residential and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Obviously, that's something we hear about all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| with how long things are taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| I think you answered one of my questions, which was already you're still doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| the next day inspections, which is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| So what I was going to ask about, though, with the inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| are the inspectors spending the same amount of time completing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| the inspection that they were before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| It's just that you have more people now, so you're able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| What I'm getting at is we're not half doing the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| We're fully doing the inspections, and it's not an accusation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| I just want to make sure that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| So thank you again for the staffing level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| Staff and technology have been our struggles for the ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| that I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| With the staffing levels that we have now, Aaron Skates is taking care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| of plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| James Tente is out of the plan review business, and he's working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| with the field inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| He's systematically going through and doing ride-alongs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| helping them, not necessarily critiquing them in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| of inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| But with these newer folks, he's taking notice of what's going well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| what's not going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| And Jim and Timothy have started up, is it a weekly or a monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| inspector meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| It's a monthly inspector meeting where they go over high points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| things that we need to improve, things that we need to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| consistency on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| And that's stuff that they've dreamt up, and they're really good meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4918)|
| 1:22:07| It was nice to talk about all that stuff with Jim two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| dream about, oh, man, someday when we have the people to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| And so to the amount of time that you're spent on an inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| we've actually, if it's noticed in the office that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| I know that you all only had six inspections because it was a super| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| light day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| What did you do with those inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Well, actually, I was able to help them, and we went through a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| permitting process to make sure that they changed what they had updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| We had individuals today that had called me and said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| they changed this from a garage to a pool halfway through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| I didn't just spend the same 15 minutes and go, eh, bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| They took the time, and they sat there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| they pulled up the permitting website and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| you need to apply for this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| And actually they're, with the lightened load and the not just going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| going, going, 150 inspections for our whole staff, it's shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| And we can actually take a little more time, in all honesty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| on those inspections to really document everything and to get everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| communicated back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| So that's what me and Jim are really trying to drive home to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| inspection crew, is making sure that if you have more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| which has been granted to us, you need to now take that time and pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| it along in your inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| And then last question I had was about the substantial investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| process being more simplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| And Director Clabo knows how much I'm a big fan of complete streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| so I just wanted to get a sense for, since those have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| those changes have been made, are we seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| and when we talk about exclusions for sidewalks and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| specifically what I was thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| but are we seeing any impact on our ability to have complete streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| Because obviously we want to balance our goals of making sure we end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5039)|
| 1:24:05| where we want to end up, but not hinder development so much that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| can't move forward and people can't make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| And so I wonder if enough time has gone by where you can even make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| As far as the substantial investment criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| the requirements that are associated with that are more about stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| criteria and when those come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| And the relief is really the cost of a developer's project to add the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| We don't want somebody to have to put in water quality because they put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| in a public sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| And so we pick things like asbestos remediation, fire flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| these criteria that on an older building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| those wouldn't come into play for a lot of other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| but when we add all these different features in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| we would hate for somebody to have to put in a water quality component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| that might even be more expensive than the improvements of their project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| just because they added all these features to the site that may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| been obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| And so that's why those things were excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| As far as meeting complete streets, to some degree on small projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| that's very difficult to achieve in an incremental basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| I think we have made a lot of efforts to promote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| Anytime there's an opportunity in an area that has a pedestrian or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| multi-modal component to it is we do have requirements that address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| perpetuating the complete streets concept on those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| But it's sometimes hard to do on an incremental basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| especially when a lot of those projects need to be more corridor based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| And so there is still a challenge with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| but it is something that we are aware of and we do try to implement those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| types of projects or those components in projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| That's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| And I appreciate that clarification because I didn't want anyone to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| exclusion for sidewalks and then think that that was preventing sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| In fact, that exclusion is making it easier to have sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| which I think is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| And then just following up on what some of my colleagues have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| you guys are doing a very difficult job and you're doing it well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| And seeing all these upgrades and updates and improving stats I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| wonderful, so keep up the good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| If not, I'll finish with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| It's obvious that you're making progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| and I'm glad to see that we're measuring it finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| And I think I look forward to updates on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| On that note, rather than us kind of asking you all the time, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| what's the latest numbers for this average, how can we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| what should we expect in terms of periodic updates on these performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| goals as you add new metrics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Is that a public-facing dashboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Is it a report to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Is it an email report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| I'd love to do all the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| I think at some point we'd love to have a public-facing dashboard with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| more data to share on activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| We would like to more regularly provide council with a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| activity report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| I don't know what that needs to be, maybe a quarterly, maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| quarterly sounds like a reasonable, you know, each quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| here's how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| But, again, I think we welcome your feedback on what kind of data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| what kind of benchmarks, what kind of information is helpful so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| more easily gather, track, and report that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| We're just getting into being able to access data, collect data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| and then analyze it and report it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| But we're getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| I think detail for council quarterly would be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| but I do think the most high-level numbers for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| because then we would have to relay that and we only have such a limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| reach in ourselves and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| So, like, basic one, two, three metrics for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| I think, would be very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| How often you update that, you know, you can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| But put it out there for everybody, I think, when you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| If there's specific metrics that you guys would like to see that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| hearing from your constituents, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Because Brian is deep in the website stuff right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| And he's deep into he's our point person with Averro, with our consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| And so if there's things that need to be built, we want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| And we're going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Well, that's the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| But the back end of the Acela, we have folks coming in from out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| I mean, we're moving at a very quick pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Averro, we mentioned Averro consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| I mean, they've got an office on the fourth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| They're essentially, some of their staff are full-time employees of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| city for the next several months as they help us work through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| process and fixing our software issues, again, on the front end and on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| That's where the data comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| So, yeah, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| And, again, this is not a static process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| So as we issue reports, you may think of other things and ways we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| And we will improve it as we get more data and work better with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| We'll get you the metrics tomorrow, Director Berry, and see them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| It'll be great for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Peter set you up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| We need three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Knock them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| We need three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| We need three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| Noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Fair requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Better than seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| If not, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240411?start=5416)|
