| 0:03:20| Yes, I move that we postpone item number 9E to the 12-8 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=200)|
| 0:03:28| That would be the December 8 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=210)|

| 0:03:37| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Our law director thinks the meeting is on the 8th, so would you remind him to please be here on the 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| I'll make sure he's here on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| The motion is to postpone 9E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| To postpone 9E until the December 4th meeting, and there's a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=235)|

| 0:04:04| I'd like to make the motion to postpone 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| We had a workshop penciled in for the 29th on this, and I don't think we acted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| But I think it's in the best interest to review this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| and make sure we're doing the best we can with these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| And I'd like to also invite the golf course committee along with as many council members as can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=267)|

| 0:04:33| That would be the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Did I do my math right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=276)|

| 0:04:40| I think there might be a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=280)|

| 0:05:14| So it will happen by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=314)|

| 0:05:57| It didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=357)|

| 0:06:18| We talked about it beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| And not knowing council's desire, I told, you know, a representative of the area, play it safe and come for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=380)|

| 0:10:11| The committee has a process in which departments can nominate employees for employee of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| and then those nominations then go to a committee of folks who evaluate them and select the employee of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| And I'm going to come forward and read to you a little bit about the employees who are the finalists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| and then I'll ask them to come join me, and we'll announce the winner at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| Do we have a handheld mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=636)|
| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| Thanks, and I think we're going to have some folks come up and help me, I think, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| The first employee that I'd like to come ask to join me is Robin Shelton, senior financial analyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| Robin, I think, is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Robin has worked for the city for more than 21 years in all areas of finance, including budget, treasury, purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| and now accounting, so she's covered the waterfront for us in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| She's the kind of person who takes on challenges that others shy away from, and she does it with an unflappable calm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| That's pretty nice in the financial world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| She possesses both great institutional knowledge as well as a comprehensive expertise in her field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| and she is currently involved in the task of upgrading and coordinating the city's fixed asset system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| including acquisition and reporting, and she has a responsibility of unclaimed property reporting as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| which is very important to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| In every role she has served in for the city, Robin has become a go-to person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| I greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| While she was in purchasing, she worked with vendors competing for a lot of high-dollar city contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| Because of her manner and skills, she was the first choice of both external and internal customers working with purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| It says here that mayors come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| I think somebody's trying to make a point to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| So do council members and senior directors, and what they do is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| Somebody's sending a message to a lot of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| But it's people like Robin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| This part is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| I'm not winging this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| It's true, who are the engines that really drive the city of Knoxville government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| We're very appreciative of the great work she's done for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| and its residents for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| So thank you very much, Robin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| Alan Scarbrough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Is Alan here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Oh, Alan's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Let me just give you a quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Alan is a public service worker, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| He's been an employee with the city of Knoxville's horticulture department for 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| During that, he's done everything from making sure our city parks are clean and safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| to landscaping and public facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| He's always done it with great pride and dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Comes in often during the middle of nights, during bad weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| I think we had some of that this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| And a crew of folks came in to take care of tree and limb removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| so that when folks get up, they can get to work in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Right now, he's the lead worker on right-of-way spraying crew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| and we're very pleased to honor him tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| Steve Sills, police officer four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Steve, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Investigator Still is a dedicated employee who goes above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| what is expected in his performance as a Knoxville police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| He's well known as an effective, hardworking, and conscientious detective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| known as a very able investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| He treats everyone with courtesy, whether they're prosecutors, defense attorneys, victims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| or the accused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| During the past year, Investigator Still was able to secure the conviction of a rapist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| who preyed on prostitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| A prosecutor noted that some people might not have taken this case as seriously as others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| but it didn't matter to Still what the victims did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| As this prosecutor noted, he respected their humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| and he wanted to get this dangerous man off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| Because of his efforts, that offender is in prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| It's just one example of the many efforts over the years that this officer has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| to benefit all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| We are very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Tom Sparks, maintenance crew leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=849)|
| 0:14:19| Tom, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Tom is actually a highly dedicated member of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| who is one of those people you can count on to not only get the job done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| but to get it done in a timely and excellent manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| He is responsible for nine police department facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| and is always working to improve those buildings for the citizens and KPD employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| and to do it in a very cost-effective way to take care of our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| He is at work early and often and is on call 24 hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| in response to whatever is needed, no matter what the situation, time of day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| weather, or any other problem that might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Because of his efforts, Tom has been selected as one of our finalists for employee of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| So this is one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| It is an incredibly high honor to get nominated to get this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| We have about 1,700 city employees, and any department can nominate anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| but they have to have good reason, and the committee scans those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| and goes through those very thoroughly in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| By the way, none of us get to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| This is voted on by a much more competent crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| It is a very high honor to have you, and I want to congratulate all three of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| But the winner chosen by the committee is, I need one of those little envelopes, don't I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| Robin Shelton. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=941)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you very much. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| I think we have a gift for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| All right. We've got to have a picture made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=967)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=979)|
| 0:16:38| We do want to congratulate all of you and thank you for, I think there was a pretty common theme there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| These are people that do whatever it takes to serve our citizens well, and we are most appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Okay. Reports to council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| On Monday at 7.30 a.m., we're having the second meeting of the Tazewell Pike Beverly Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| I mentioned it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| We are changing locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| We are now at the Cal Johnson Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| 7.30 a.m. on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Aspire to be through by 8.30 so folks can get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| By saying this, he'll probably never come again, but I want to recognize a coach of the KYS championship baseball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| who's here tonight, Mike King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Third, as the mayor alluded to, Steve King and I got to go to Croatia with our church next door here at First Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1044)|
| 0:17:33| It was a very eye-opening experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| and it was very humbling how you really need to take into account what you have here in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| But on a lighter note, there was a dinner before the dedication on Sunday for this pastoral center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| and I got to speak to about 150 people and embarrassed Steve King and the others from Knoxville greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| You know, there are some gifts being presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| And, you know, I told the folks, you know, well, first, I'm proud to be from Knoxville, proud to be from Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| and proud to be a Southerner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| I said, you know, I can't give gifts to everybody, so I'll give you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| And I taught them a little bit of Southern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| And I taught, you know, about 150 people that were Croatians and Germans and elsewhere to say, how y'all doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| So, just, you know, a little part of, you know, of us, of Knoxville, you know, to share and help folks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1102)|
| 0:18:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Appreciate you all representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| By invitation from one of the city council members of our friendly sister city, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| or city across the mountain, Charlotte, North Carolina, drove over early yesterday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| and joined a host of local leaders and dignitaries, including the two United States Senators from North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1131)|
| 0:19:02| and participated in a ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| Well, I didn't cut the ribbon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| I was just there watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| But it was their part of the celebration of the inaugural kickoff of their new light rail system, the Lynx light rail system, in Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1148)|
| 0:19:18| An extraordinary event, an extraordinary operation, what they've pulled together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| and what they've been able to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| And it was their saying, you know, Knoxville's behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| What you do is great for Charlotte, but it bodes well for the rest of us, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| You set a shining example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| And I didn't have a chance to say that publicly because I wasn't one of the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| but just by our presence I wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| And they were very gracious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| And it was a wonderful thing to experience and to be a part of and to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| And I think it's, again, a shining example of what a city in the southeast can accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| a city that's a little bigger than Knoxville, but very, very similar in terms of all the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| transportation and otherwise, that they have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| And I will say that this 10-mile line that goes south from downtown has a series of stations on it, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| and the station areas around it that are potential development sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| In anticipation of this line, developers have already begun to develop along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| And the line itself wasn't cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| It was about $300 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| But they've already tabulated or tracked $1.4 billion of new investment in those station areas along that line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1228)|
| 0:20:38| in anticipation of the line opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| So it's really been a tremendous stimulus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| The other thing I'll throw in, in case folks aren't aware of it, in 1998, Charlotte and Mecklenburg County passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| the voters passed by a small margin, a half-cent sales tax to fund transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| Both the bus system and the light rail line, of which this is the first light rail system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| there will be, I think, three new light rail lines in addition to this, a commuter rail line, a streetcar line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| and a bus rapid transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| So they have a very ambitious program in their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| That tax brings in over $70 million a year now for transit, from what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| And there was an anti-transit and anti-tax coalition that tried to rescind that half-cent transit sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1280)|
| 0:21:29| And when the voters went to the polls a couple of weeks ago, not only did they deny that effort to rescind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| but they denied it overwhelmingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| It failed by a much larger margin than the tax originally passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| By 70 to 30 percent, the voters said, no, this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| We want this to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| And 70 percent of the voters upheld that tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| So they're doing great things, and they're a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| And they said, we'd love for a bunch of you folks from Knoxville to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| And also, Mayor, your friend, Pat McCrory, the mayor of Charlotte, said to be sure to say hello to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| So I said I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| First, I wanted to ask the vice mayor for some clarification on, I know council has six appointments to the P&I board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| which is, you know, boards that are responsible for oversight of the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| To sort of go over how those appointments are going to be made, what the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| we're supposed to be following on that because it's a little different from what we traditionally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| What we need to do on those items, I've got Cindy Mitchell circulating some dates for those council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| in whose districts the ZACs lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| The agreement was, and what's been passed with P&I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| is that those council members for zone advisory councils lie within their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Those folks should be able to go out and find an individual to recommend a council to appoint to those boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| One of the problems is a couple of those ZACs are shared by council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| For example, Councilman Holquist and I share the downtown ZAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| and he and I can't sit down over lunch and decide looking at a list of candidates on who we want to recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| That needs to come out of a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| So what my recommendation has been is that within each of the zone or ZAC areas that there be a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| where both council members or in one instance I think there may be three council members who actually share a ZAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| They will come together, consider those applicants, those individuals who are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| can have an open discussion about those individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| and hopefully come to a recommendation to bring to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| I know there's an application form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Is there an expectation of folks applying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| or is this a meeting where the council people can do their process openly but as they choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| Well, I think each council member, those council members who share ZACs can talk about, I think, their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| Just as I believe, and Mr. Swanson, help us before we go too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| we can talk about a date on which we wish to meet because that's not substantive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| and maybe even what the agenda will look like as long as you're not talking about anything substantive going to a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Sounds like you've read the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| So I think, you know, for example, in those districts where you and I think Councilman Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| and maybe Councilman Frost overlap, you all can decide on how your agenda will run and the date you're going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| Ms. Mitchell has graciously agreed to help us find locations in those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| So I don't want to direct you guys how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| I've got ideas that I'll bounce, you know, about our agenda, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| for the one where Councilman Holquist and I overlap and I think Councilman Frost and I overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| I think those council members can best determine that because you know your district better than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| and I think it's very important that that council member and those council members can bring those human resources to the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| and know those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| It's better for them, for you in your area, to tell me who you think may be a good person to represent your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| as opposed to me telling you who should represent your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| On a personal note, a lot of you all know I've been dating this woman named Corrine from Virginia for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| I've known her almost 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I just want to announce last weekend I asked her to marry me, and she said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| The council's all invited to the wedding, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| We're speechless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Are you kidding, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| It's taken us 25 years to get this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| We'll figure things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| No, we haven't worked out any of the details, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1535)|

| 0:26:41| it's not a one-year or two-year, sometimes we ought to tell them on the record, thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| That's a good note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1605)|

| 0:26:50| That's a good note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1610)|

| 0:30:06| I'll get this right here in a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| 11D, is there a motion to approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Any discussions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1811)|

| 0:30:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| 9F is an ordinance to close a 15-foot alley from Sanderson Road to Clifton Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners, A&M Enterprises, Inc., 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| This relates a little bit to the question that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| This relates a little bit to something that we're considering later in the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| regarding a rezoning of the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| And I just realized this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| And I don't know whether it would make sense to postpone consideration of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| until we consider the rezoning later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| If you look at it, there's a proposal to make this area a commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| It's currently residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| I guess closing the alley in between doesn't mean that you have to approve the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| but they are sort of interconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| That's 9Y?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Is it 9Y?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| No, it's 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| It's 9X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| 9X?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| 9X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Is it too late in the process to move to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| We can move to 9Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Move that one up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| I'll make a motion to move 9X to be considered now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| I think it's X and Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| X and Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| X and Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| There's a motion to have 9X and Y be considered now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Then we will move to 9X and Y at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| Do we currently have a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| So how do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Which motion are you withdrawing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| The one to close the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| So you're withdrawing 9F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| And the second is willing to withdraw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| That was Bob, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Bob, are you willing to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Then we can go to 9X and Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| 9X is an ordinance approving the request of A&M Enterprises, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| for a one-year plan amendment from low-density residential to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| for property located on the northeast side of Sanderson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| southwest side of Clifton Road, southeast of Western Avenue, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| I guess my initial question would be directed to Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| When I looked at the map of this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| and read that the plans are for a restaurant, a Sonic specifically, on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| I was a little concerned because the proposed restaurant will be backing up to residential in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=1991)|
| 0:33:21| Right now there's some more transitional uses to the east and to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| There's a bank and a dentist to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| There's actually a power substation to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| I went and drove by it on the way down this evening, and seeing it in person emphasized my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| The parcel that faces on Western, between which we were just talking about closing the alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| is obviously already commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| But there are two, four, six, eight at least homes coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| that they're asking for this rezoning to build this restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| And this is a little bit similar to me to some situations that we looked at over off Merchant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| I can't think what it is you've come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| And although MPC has required some dense screening at the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| I still had concerns about this rezoning and wanted to hear why MPC felt this was recommended for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| The property has commercial zoning to the west and the power line easement and substation to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| The block of residential to the south, all of the properties face either Sanderson or Clifton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| They don't face Carnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| And then we did place the condition of screening along Carnation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| so that access won't penetrate into the neighborhood at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| So the bank and the dentist are not office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| They're commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| I just don't feel like this is an appropriate transition into a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| And, you know, obviously there's commercial along Western to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| but this really protrudes to the south into the neighborhood where there are homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| And I'm not sure that the back of a restaurant is the best thing to back up into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2109)|
| 0:35:17| Councilwoman Pilon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Is there anyone here in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| I represent the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| We canvassed the neighborhood, and there was no one at MPC in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| There was one man who had a question, and I think it involved the landscaping, did it not, on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| wanted to make sure that that was a requirement that would go on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| We canvassed, Mr. Elledge here canvassed the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| About the time we filed it, when the sign went up for MPC, there was no opposition at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| It went through on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| We have heard nothing further since the MPC meeting, and he has been back through the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| because City Council does put up signs for zonings prior to the hearing just to see if anybody had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| Well, I recall when that came before MPC because I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| and I do recall the gentleman asking about the landscaping barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| Right, and that is a condition of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| And we have a sonic drive-in that TDOT is taking on the other side of 640, and this is going to be relocated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2190)|
| 0:36:40| This property was probably changed when they widened Western Avenue a number of years ago, the area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| and when they put the KUB, put the power substation in there, which is immediately to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Are utility substations, one of the uses permitted in an R1 zone, an R1A as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| R1E2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| I believe that is zoned R1 to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| So that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| It is not limited to a commercial type of situation then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| Well, there is a power line easement through that entire half block as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| so the chances of it being ever developed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| What I'm saying is there's kind of the implication that if the utility substation is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| it's got some more open zoning than residential, and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| It is allowed in residentially zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| I'm going to go to Councilman Becker, and then I'll come back to Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| I kind of agree with some of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I mean, when I drove this area, I was struck by the quality of the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| And I think one of the issues we get, and I think Ms. Pelo's question goes to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| that this council, that there are lots of areas in this city that do not have well-organized neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| A lot of times that's a class issue, where there are people that are poorer and busier and don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| You know, I hate to say old Callahan, but I see it up there to a degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| where when there aren't people raising a ruckus, we tend to go along with things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I don't know that this is necessarily a good long-range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| It is intruding into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| It's moving some very nice houses out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| So I have some real concerns about it, and I'm glad we're discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| And back to Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| I was going to say to Councilman Frost, there's a KUB substation in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| Everything is zoned R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| So I think, you know, that might answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| It doesn't really address this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| I just remember distinctly that day that it was not felt that this was going to be a negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| in regard to the property values there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| I just think the lighting, if I'm ‑‑ can I remember that long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| Well, the two conditions MPC put was the 15-foot buffer on the rear along Coronation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2344)|
| 0:39:12| and that there would be no access onto Coronation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| It would either be onto Western or to Sanderson or Clifton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| The site plan has access points on Western and on Sanderson, and they did not want any ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2362)|
| 0:39:32| the reason for the condition is to avoid any intrusion into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| Cut through traffic or specifically, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I'm not sure I have anything new to say other than when I drove by this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| all eight of these homes are currently occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| and very much had a feeling of a neighborhood all the way up to the commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| that currently faces onto Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| And I respect the fact that the neighbors have been canvassed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| but I guess I agree with Councilman Becker that there are situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| where neighborhoods aren't well organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| And I don't even know, you know, I don't know where the notice was posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| and how it would be interpreted if I were a neighbor that all eight of these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| are no longer going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| but this whole thing is going to be combined into one parcel to be a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| And for me personally, it just doesn't fit with the neighborhood use that surrounds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| At least it's got R1 on the south and R1 to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| Yes, could I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Yes, you sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Jay Elledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I live at 2709 Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| I own seven pieces of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| I own all the four houses on Sanderson, which faces the bank and the doctor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| which is C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| And then on the backside of Coronation, I own from Sanderson to Clifton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2456)|
| 0:41:04| And I spoke with the people on Coronation that is directly behind on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| Kenny McCoy, he's not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| And then the house on the next east corner of that lot is a motorcycle club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| I know those guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| They're not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| And the only two houses I don't own is owned by Car Mellon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| which is directly behind the Muffer Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| And he's having problems keeping it maintained because he's short on money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| And then the other two ladies, Mrs. Wallace and Hancock, I talked with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| and they have no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| And then on the east side, directly behind the Hardee's restaurant is a substation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| and a power line easement goes from behind Hardee's all the way to the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| So I've talked to everybody in the neighborhood, and nobody has opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| And they are all rental properties, the ones that I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Mr. Eldridge, the properties, the two properties at 101, which is owned by, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| Mr. Melton, and at 103, which is owned by Mrs. Wallace and Mrs. Hancock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| do you have those under contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| No, I just, you know, I talked to Mr. Mellon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| He would like to get the alley closed between him and the Muffer Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| I mean, he's agreed to it because he, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| he'd like to make sure they never make a reuse of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| And then I talked to the Mrs. Wallace and Mrs. Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| As a matter of fact, one of the signs was in her yard, the MPC signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| And I went and talked with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| She has no problem being rezoned commercially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| Those folks are planning to continue to live in their houses for the foreseeable future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Well, the lady I talked to, she had some dogs and the people were complaining about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| She's talked about it and thought about moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| And then Carl Melton, he don't have any choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| I mean, he'd probably like to get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| He's just not financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I mean, you can drive by and see that his area, his house is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Where I'm going with this is you're proposing to rezone all of this block that's not already C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| which is just the two parcels that front Western Avenue or C3 currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| The rest are R1 and R1A, and you're proposing to rezone all those parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| two of which you do not own and are presently occupied for the purpose that they're zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| residentially by the parties, as you indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Let me finish, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| And they're not, neither of them are currently planning to move or have a contract to sell their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2632)|
| 0:44:02| So you're asking us to rezone those two parcels for other owners who intend to continue to live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2642)|
| 0:44:12| under the present zoning, and you're asking us to rezone those two parcels commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| They have no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| They favor the value of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| But you're asking us to rezone residential properties for commercial to C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| even though they intend to continue to live there for the time being in residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| Mr. Donaldson, if I was understanding Councilman Holquist's line of questioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| shouldn't there have been, with the MPC agenda information given to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| the paperwork where it's signed by affected property owners that they agree with the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| Well, that's the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| The question is for Mr. McDonaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| We have the rezoning and plan amendment application that is signed by Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| representing that he's the authorized representative of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| But was there a ñ that's not my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| Why isn't there ñ there's typically attached to the information council gets from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| a sheet of paper that probably has 20 lines on it, and it gives the person's name, their address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| and do they support or oppose the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| And it's not attached with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| I don't see it in the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| They verbally requested rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| I was looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Typically I'll get an amendment or a request, a written request to join in the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| If you want to pull those two properties out, there is no problem with our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| When the signs were ñ if you know, when the signs were put up notifying folks of not just the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| but these two city council meetings, was a sign put on every single parcel of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| or was it just one on one side of the street, one on the other, or something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| I'm sure that we would not have put one on every parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| We probably put one on every block face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| We do mail notice to all property owners within the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| and within 200 feet of the proposed rezoning as well as publishing in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Mr. Elledge, so there are eight houses, eight pieces of property with houses on them tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| and I understand correctly you own six of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I own seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| One's a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| So there are nine parcels of property and eight with houses and one vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| And you own seven of the nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Yeah, I guess there's been a lot of discussion about ownership and control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| and I think that zoning isn't just doing what the property owner wants done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| It's about planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| It's about the vision of the future of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| So, you know, to a degree, I don't know whether it would make a difference in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| if all eight property owners agreed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| If it's something that's not good for the long-term good of the city, I would be opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| And I like some of the questions about the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| I think they're worth bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| But I think Ms. Roddy's question is really good, is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| is changing this part of this neighborhood what we want to do as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| And I would have to say if I have to be asked right now, I'd say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| I don't think I like this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| And it's a legislative authority, so we can say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Can say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Councilman Whitelaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| And I resonate with that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| Did I mishear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Do you live in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Oh, you do live in this neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| 2709, the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| There's a garage apartment at the corner of Coronation and Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| And what do people call this neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Sanderson Addition is what it was years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| And to your knowledge, is there a neighborhood association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| There's none?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Most of the houses in there are rental houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| And you're one block off of 640 of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| It makes it, you know, on the other side of Sanderson Road, it's probably dropped back 300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| 400 feet from Western Avenue commercial on the West Haven shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| and the dentist office and barbershops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| And on the other side of 640 going west, it's commercial all the way around the curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| all the way to Third Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I resonate with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| I like what I hear Councilman Roddy is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| To me, it's an issue of the people not being able to make the kind of decision you're suggesting we should make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| And I don't really know what to do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| Maybe there is a neighborhood association that you're unaware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Let me make one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| They put the signs up and they stay up for over two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| And, plus, they mail out statements to all adjoining property owners advising that there's going to be a zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2975)|
| 0:49:46| And I have no idea of any opposition whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| And I live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Just about everybody knows me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| So, as far as the people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| The fact that you haven't heard anything doesn't mean that there isn't any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| You know, they had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| This is the third time they could have came up and opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| It's a very specific opportunity related to whether or not they see this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| Well, Mr. Ellings talked to other people in the neighborhood prior to the MPC meeting about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| If you all have concerns, we would request a postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| We'll bring in the other two people that are involved in this and let them speak to you, if that would be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| I'd feel better about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Well, you know, I guess I'm not opposed to postponement, but I go back to, I mean, I want to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3040)|
| 0:50:49| Let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I go back to what Councilman Roddy and Councilman Becker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| And I really, I don't know, resonates one word that was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| I relate to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I think that's the approach we need to take to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| What is the best thing for the city and what's the best thing for the surrounding communities, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| I think we need to look at this and think about it real carefully, real carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| Councilwoman Roddy, and then I'll go to Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| If we do postpone this, I would encourage other council members to drive and take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| When I was there this evening, there were children out playing in the easement area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| just south of the substation, the parcel that's to the southeast of the parcel that we're proposing to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| And it felt very much like a neighborhood park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| You know, it was evening and kids were out and they were in that grassy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| And, you know, presumably these are kids that maybe face on Chillicothe and this is their back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| And it just didn't feel right in terms of having respect for this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| And, you know, I would like to know how these people up and down Chillicothe feel about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| because to me this intrudes into what is their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Well, we've heard a lot of talk tonight about the proper planning and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| And we have MPC here, and I'm about to say something I don't normally say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| And, I mean, we pay these folks that are professional planners to look at these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| and staff recommended this under a few conditions, and MPC approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3149)|
| 0:52:38| And, I mean, if we're not going to use these folks, you know, in a manner in which they're designed to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3158)|
| 0:52:46| in the manner in which we pay them for, then maybe we should not pay out that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Councilman Peel already had her light on, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Go ahead, and I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Well, in response to Councilman Hall's statement, I have great respect for Councilman Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| and I certainly appreciate it when he speaks up, which doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3189)|
| 0:53:17| I just want to say that we are the ones that are elected to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| And we have a great staff at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| I have tremendous respect for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| I work with them almost on a daily basis, but as many council members do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| But I think it would be a little bit of a stretch for me to think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3213)|
| 0:53:40| to assume that no matter what they recommend, the thing to do is to approve it all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| and that all their recommendations are 100% correct or the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| So that's the only place that I would perhaps disagree to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Not 100% disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I actually agree with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| You know, but I hear all the time the MPC recommended, staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| I, for one, don't necessarily agree with them all the time either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| But it seems like for the most part the majority of council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| And that was the basis of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| But not 100% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Ms. Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Well, I'm going to say something I don't normally say either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| It isn't to be disparaging about any neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| but I've watched this area for longer years than I would like to admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3265)|
| 0:54:33| And it's an area that has changed enormously in my awareness lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| And, you know, you know my position on neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| It's very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| But sometimes just given what I believe to be the character of this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| I think we're trying to elevate it to something that unfortunately it can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| Because when property now becomes rental property, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| it's very difficult to get people to, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| they're really not in a position to make decisions about that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| And I did listen to this at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| For once I didn't feel it was an encroachment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| because I almost felt that this could be a kind of a neighborhood amenity for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| Because I'm pretty confident there are a lot of latchkey kids and so on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| And I don't know, I guess maybe I'm looking at it differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| because it is bordered as such a commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| And I thought that the lighting and some of the aspects of the sonic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| would actually provide maybe a little safety for some of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| I'm going to drive back and look at it again for the zillionth time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| But it just appeared to me that this might be a good time for there to be a change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| And I was extremely interested to hear this gentleman owns these parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| because I frankly did not do my homework like I should have to have determined that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| This has been an interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| I think rather than having it denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| I think I would appreciate an opportunity to give it a little more consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| So I'm not sure where we are with motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| The only motion right now is the original motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Well, can I make a substitute motion at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| You can make a motion to postpone if that's where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| I would make a motion to postpone this, I think for probably two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| because I imagine there's some business ramifications to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| And I presume we would be postponing three of these agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| So is it, can we make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| The motion would be to postpone all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Nine F, nine X, and nine Y for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| There's four items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| What did I miss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Nine G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Yeah, the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Nine F, G, X, and Y, two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| Okay, there's a motion to postpone for two weeks those four items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Okay, discussion now on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| If you have your light on, it needs to be on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| First, you know, I want to know how the district-specific representative, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| feels about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| And to address the comments, getting to the postponement a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| you also have to take into account, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| you can get neighborhoods that have been down on the heels at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| and have come back successfully, Park Ridge, Old North Knoxville, Island Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| and the list goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| So, I mean, that's a counter-argument to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| do you draw the line at some circumstance or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| But I am interested to see how Councilman Hall feels about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| Councilman Hall, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Well, if the property owners don't have any objections, I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| Was that a no, Mr. You're okay with the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| This is a little bit unorthodox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| but in a neighborhood that doesn't have a neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| they usually have a coffee house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| And I think there's a little, like a little diner across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| You probably won't want to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| but you could usually find some people there who are in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| who have an opinion about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| Go in there at lunch and just ask the owner if you can just sort of stop everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| and ask them what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Now, you probably won't want to do that, but there are hubs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| And I agree with what Mr. Councilman Hall is saying about MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| and their professional advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| but it just feels like good manners to make sure that the people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| not only are aware of what's going on but understand the implications for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3552)|
| 0:59:21| And it could be that this is a great project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| and it could be that it's good for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| but I'd like for the community to be aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| I realize that we are now discussing the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| I think that the discussion that we were on before is every bit as pertinent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| in relation to the postponement as it is to the actual motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| And so going back to Councilman Pelos' statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| and then Councilman Frost's statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| I think I concur with Councilman Frost about the fragility of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| and how we have to be very cognizant of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| And, you know, I'm not ready to write off any neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| I'm not ready to say, you know, this is the trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| therefore it's the way we ought to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| I think we need to be very careful about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| And in terms of compatible commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| I understand what you're saying, Councilman Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| I'm not so sure if we were talking about latchkey kids and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| a Sonic would be the best thing because it's all a drive-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| and unless they have cars, you know, it's probably not that compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Go ahead, Mr. Elquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| So, again, I think we really have to think about not only maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| the integrity of neighborhoods but undergirding them when we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| and doing what we can to improve them and protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| So I'm just really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| And, you know, I'm not necessarily opposed to postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| but I'm certainly not ready to vote in favor of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| Ms. Pelos, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Seeing no other lights, we're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| The motion is to postpone for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| And we vote for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| But, you know, I heard two things here that we need to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I want to make sure I'm clear that I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| And I think the owner needs to be clear that he hears and this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| because they both kind of come out two different ways once you get the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| And that is I heard one thing coming from us about the opinion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| neighbors and the surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| And then there's another thing coming forth about is it good land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| and good land planning and good land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| And those can be two different answers to this question two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| And so we need to be very careful about what we are implying by this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| And those are two things I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| And I'm sure Mr. Seymour, being as astute as he is, hears those things also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| And I get real concerned sometimes when we have these debates and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| it makes it sound like either depending on the answer to one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| questions is going to determine how we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| And I don't think that's necessarily the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| And neighbors' opinions and good land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| and planning are two very different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| And sometimes the answers coincide and sometimes they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| And we need to kind of think about that as a council next time so that when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| make a decision we make it in light of both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Seeing no further lights, we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| The motion before us is to postpone for two weeks those four items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I heard nine ayes and no nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=3765)|

| 1:08:48| Councilman Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| Councilman Becker, I believe at the last meeting when this was approved on first reading, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| were some people with concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Were there not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Can you tell us how that got resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Well, these are folks who just read the caption and new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| Once they looked at the specifics of it, they were fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| They were concerned about uses and there was a bunch of what was happening that wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| supposed to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| And the interesting part is this is rezoning an area about 16 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| It's a very small area and I think people assumed this was a whole lot and it was right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| next to a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| So those concerns were all dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4160)|

| 1:09:49| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Do we want to consider 12D as the zoning one and it's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Do we want to consider that one before we do this just to make sure we don't trip ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| on something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I don't think we will, but we're trying to be smarter about these things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| Any comments there, anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| It's necessary to do a one-year plan before you do a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Well, the one's on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| One's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| So we can't make that mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| And it's up to the district rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| I'm not, you know, just want to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I think the concern is going to be about 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| But I really don't see the advantage on this one is to change it because the plan has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4225)|
| 1:10:33| changed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| And to the best of my memory, the discussion was on the type of commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| not whether to allow commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| And that may have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| It was a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| I think we had a motion and a second then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4258)|

| 1:11:26| I had gotten a call from someone in one of the markets there in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| I think it's 16th or 17th Street Market or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| And I think they were concerned about either this or the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| They're two different ones that we passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| They're right down the street from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| I tried to return their call and left a message and they never called me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| You know, that's one of those things, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| I probably should have tried and tried to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| I left a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| My inclination is to go ahead and approve it unless they're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4314)|

| 1:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| I guess this question is for Mr. Harrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| I know that when we had the workshop on this project recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| we talked a lot about the need for HUD approval for the revision of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| And I wondered, in reading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| if we need to have heard back from HUD to make this amendment to the operating agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| We did hear back from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| We got a response back on Friday, November 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| which said that we concur that the developer's proposed lease assignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| would not place the city in violation of any HUD requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| requiring repayment of EZ grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| And basically what they're saying is that we have met all of the obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| for the use of the empowerment zone funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| and so this proposal they are in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4550)|

| 1:17:58| That seems even slow for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| That is a state requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| In other words, we don't think it would take us that long to complete the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| but if it's not completed by that time, then we would lose the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| So this is the contract with the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| With the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| We'll see future contracts with somebody to actually do the improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| that will have the actual deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4702)|

| 1:18:49| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Well, I know Ms. Weatherstone is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| I talked to her earlier on the phone and asked her to be here just in case there are questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| and folks wanted to hear the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| And I think it's just a more complicated project, but I think everyone understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| Obviously, council is okay with it because we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| So I won't dwell on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| These are difficult projects, but I think everybody wants to see it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4752)|

| 1:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| We do have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Would you like to speak first or not, Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| Well, I wanted to put a little context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Ms. Davis, can you wait a second and let Mr. Becker go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Well, I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| We had a couple of us were at BZA the other day, and we had an application come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| and it shows why part of what this does is changes the process for these going from BZA to MPC is use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| Had a fellow who got up with a BZA request for variance for a larger lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| Rob Dansgrove did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| He said, State your name and address and your hardship, which is what BZA deals with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| And the guy said, Name such and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| I live at such and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| And my what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| And Rob said, Why you need this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| And he says, Because I have a two-acre lot, and nobody lives on three sides of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| And I think we need to make this change because BZA deals with problem properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| and the places that need potentially larger lots, it makes much more sense to go to MPC for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| because they can actually look at whether it's the right thing to do rather than is this a problem property that we somehow have to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| It got turned down, and partly it got turned down because it wasn't a problem with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| The guy had a big lot, lots of land, so we denied him the right to build a larger piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| So there's some problems with this that I think this fixes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| and I wanted to kind of set that context because it was, I think, very clear what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Ms. Davis, do you want to go speak now, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Charlotte Davis, 104 Crawford Road in Fountain City, and I'm here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| Did I understand that this is going to be approved as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| But, yes, there's a vote to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Well, I don't have very much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| You have received, I believe, an e-mail from Mark Campin, who is current chairman of Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| and I'm not going to read it but wanted to kind of summarize the content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| Fountain City Town Hall continues to be opposed to some parts of the proposed change in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4954)|
| 1:22:42| regulating accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| We are in agreement that the use on review via MPC is a good process change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4964)|
| 1:22:52| We are not in agreement with the proposed change in the right of use of the size of an accessory building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| We would prefer that it stay as it is now, 750 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| but would not be opposed to a maximum size of 850 to 900,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| but we remain very opposed to the suggested 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| Town Hall also does not agree with the provision that says that the accessory building can be as large as the primary residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=4996)|
| 1:23:26| as long as both do not exceed 30 percent of the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| We suggest that this be changed to read that the accessory building not exceed 50 percent of the primary residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5011)|
| 1:23:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| I'm going to go to Mr. Frost and then come back to Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| I agree with Councilman Becker and Ms. Davis about the issue of having MPC hear these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| That's probably good policy, good procedure, so I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| Without rehashing what I said last time, I do have concerns about bumping the size up so greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| as well as having the ability to have two similarly sized buildings on the same piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5046)|
| 1:24:17| It might look a little funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| It might look out of place and out of character, so we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| I guess Councilman Becker's motion is to pass it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5066)|
| 1:24:36| I'll let other people talk, but I'm going to make some substitute motions regarding the size of the secondary building to be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5076)|
| 1:24:44| and the percentage as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| I'll go back to Councilman Becker now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| I guess I was going to do that as well, and I'll wait for Mr. Frost to make those amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| which I think I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| Do you want to wait on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| I think I had Councilman Hoek was next, and I'll come to Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| I'm glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| I think what I'm hearing is there will be amendments forthcoming that will address the sizes that are allowed by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| and I think that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| I think I'm agreeing with what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| The use on review approach is appropriate, and that's the way people get larger structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| if they want to go through the process if Council approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| But I, too, am uneasy with the size requirements, the 100 percent equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| and the 1,100 square foot maximum by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| I think that's, to me, that's where the rub is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| And so I'd like to see that reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| I'm not necessarily saying we should keep those numbers as they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| but 50 percent, what they're suggesting, what Charlotte's suggesting, maybe 850, 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| But let's hear what Councilman Pilo has and then what the amendments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Well, I could just almost say ditto, because I was really putting my light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| to say that I cannot vote for it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| And I think listening to the issue that was before the BCA was a very good exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| because it demonstrates some of the really difficult situations that can occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| that would not make any of us happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| And I thought Ms. Davis gave an excellent presentation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| which certainly convinced the BCA that they needed to consider that carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| And I was highly impressed with the recommendations of Fountain City Town Hall two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| and I appreciate her coming back and presenting those again, because I tend to be very supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| I, too, will say that I do think, and particularly after listening to BCA many times on these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| that going back to MPC is probably a very good solution to some of the concerns we all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5209)|
| 1:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| I'm going to make a proposed amendment that we just bump the size up to 850 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| which is an increase of 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Mr. Becker is shaking his head, and he can make a substitute, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| And, I mean, I wouldn't mind 750, but if, you know, just fill the will of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| Also, to leave the current size regulations as is, to not permit the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5242)|
| 1:27:32| allowing the principal structure and the secondary structure to be of equal size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| Just leave it currently as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Well, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| I actually could live with 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| And I guess this is a question for language for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| Mr. Frost, as I read what's currently in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| it actually does say not exceed the building area of the principal building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| or blank square feet, whichever is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Are you trying to deal with the concern Ms. Davis said about as large as the principal building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| Because I'm not sure you do that with what I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| I'm certainly open to discussing it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Mr. Swanson and I were trying to have that conversation when it became my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| Sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| Well, do you all want to talk for a second and figure that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| I want to just raise another question, sort of unrelated, if you all want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| I mean, if someone wants to propose 750 square feet as well, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| You're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| Well, let me, I think one thing I've heard some concern about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| and I wanted to actually ask Mr. Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| A lot of people have talked to me and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| shouldn't the accessory building size be somehow related to the lot size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| And I'm wondering if that was considered in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| By definition, the accessory building is related to the primary building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| and it simply is defined to be subordinate to the primary building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| And that led us to allowing accessory buildings to be as large as the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| as long as they're no larger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| There are so many different permutations as far as lot areas go that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| extremely difficult to set a percentage of lot area that would work in all cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| You know, we have got 10-acre lots out there, and we've got 10,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| and 5% of a 10-acre lot is really a lot, and 5% of a 10,000 square foot lot is really small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5382)|
| 1:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| So there's some reasons it wasn't thought about then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| Tying it to the primary building, and as we looked at ordinances throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| you know, they're all over the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| but by far the plurality of them simply define an accessory building as smaller than the primary building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5401)|
| 1:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| I'm going to go to Ms. Peel and then come back to you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Well, I wanted to ask the question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| I believe Fountain City has proposed 50% of the size of the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| Speak to that recommendation they've made, if you will, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| Well, it certainly could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| It's something that we didn't consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| So in order to do that, I think we'd have to bring it back to the planning commission for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5436)|
| 1:30:43| And, again, as you look at ordinances throughout the country dealing with accessory buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| there are communities that set a percentage of the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| There are communities that set a numerical number comparable to our existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5455)|
| 1:31:04| Fifty is a number that is used by some communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| Seventy-five percent is used by some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| I just recall the issue that was before BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| and one of the problems there was that the new structure was actually going to be larger than the ______.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| Well, that wouldn't be allowed under the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| It would have to be smaller in terms of building coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| I'm going to propose to withdraw my motion to make a different type of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| I'm going to propose that the only thing that this addresses is moving the body that makes these decisions from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5499)|
| 1:31:47| Board of Zoning Appeals to the Metropolitan Planning Commission and leaving everything else as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| There's a motion and a second to move the body that considers all these from BZA to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| I see no light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| The size then would stay at 750, and it would still be, as it is now, up to equal to the size of the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5528)|
| 1:32:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Because that is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| That's the current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| What I'm proposing is the only change would be changing the body that hears it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| And that's the change you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| So I'm trying to understand what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| Are you eliminating everything from the ordinance that doesn't do that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| Or are you leaving everything that doesn't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| I'm leaving the ordinance as is, only changing the body that hears the particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5568)|
| 1:32:57| The ordinance is on the books now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Oh, you're leaving the code the way it is and just changing it so that would leave it at 750 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| but also leave it as equal to, you know, the size of the current primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5587)|
| 1:33:16| Whichever is lesser, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Yeah, it's the lesser of the primary building or 750 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| So we're only talking that only impacts buildings that are at that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| I see no other light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| You ready to vote on it, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| If I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| The way the ordinance is written currently, there is a maximum cap, literally, of 750 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| which requires a variance from the zoning ordinance to do anything above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5624)|
| 1:33:51| The MPC doesn't have the authority to grant a variance like that unless it's in the context of a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| or a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| So I think we would have to play with the language other than just that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| I don't think I want to make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Well, maybe you want to make a motion to refer it back to MPC and consider those alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| Give me two or three bullet points to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| The motion is to refer back to MPC and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| I think we agree what we want to do, and I would hate since this is just first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| I would hate for the current system of going to BZA to last for however long it's going to take to figure this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| when I think we can figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| I don't think it's that complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| I think that what we need to do, I think, is just what Mr. Frost proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| which is eliminating all the language in the ordinance we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| Mr. Swanson, help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Mr. Swanson needs to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| I'm sorry, but I don't think you can do that because I think that's substantially different from what MPC considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| And if it's substantially different from what MPC considered, MPC will have to consider it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| It's like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| Mr. Frost, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Well, let me try this as an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5718)|
| 1:35:26| If we keep the ordinance that's before us, change the 1,000 feet to 750, we have kept it essentially as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5726)|
| 1:35:37| but we've also allowed the consideration to be made, the decision made by MPC as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5737)|
| 1:35:46| that accomplishes what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| We don't need to dump all the other language, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| Because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| The proposed amendments have two different concepts in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| There's a cap and there's a threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| The proposed amendment has a cap for accessory buildings that are smaller than the primary building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| It has a threshold by which it moves from a use by right to a use on review at either 750, 900, or 1,100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5770)|
| 1:36:19| the three numbers that we considered at the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| The current ordinance has only a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| There's not a threshold for switching from a use by right to a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| and that's what we would have to address in any new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5791)|
| 1:36:38| But if all we do is change that threshold level from 1,100 square feet to 750, I think we've done what council wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5798)|
| 1:36:48| Then you still have the cap, which is any building smaller than the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5808)|
| 1:36:54| But whichever is smaller, so it still remains at 750 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| and it would only be a factor in houses in the city that are smaller than 750 square feet, which is pretty few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5819)|
| 1:37:09| And I just think we can deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| So I'd like to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5832)|
| 1:37:19| The motion on the floor is to refer back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| Okay, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| I don't know if council wants this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| but another option is just to vote this whole thing down and the system would stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| I'm not sure that I want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| I don't know about the sense of the rest of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| But if we're going to keep a cap of 750,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| but if MPC is going to be allowed to consider a higher number under use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5868)|
| 1:37:58| then we can't do it with what we've got in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| It's got to be MPC cannot grant variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| We have to specifically state what can be allowed under use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| And so we could say unlimited, or we could say 750 by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| and then up to 1,500 under use on review, or pick a number, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| But the language has to say that they can allow something under use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5907)|
| 1:38:34| They can't grant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| And so I think that's one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| And what Mr. Donaldson is suggesting is that this council gets some guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| because if we just throw it back to MPC and they don't know what we're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| it may come back looking like it does, or who knows what it will come back looking like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Let me say that this is such an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5939)|
| 1:39:07| I shudder to think that what could happen if we sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| and try to cobble together the right language here at this 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| I think it makes great sense to send it back to Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| with an understanding about what we're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| or at least what some of the council members are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| I think he can glean from the discussion kind of where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| We've done it before, quite frankly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| at the last minute to try and make sure we stop something from happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| and we've had to come back two or three times to try to correct some things, you know, in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| And we wanted to say what those issues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| So, you know, this is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| I think we need to be very careful about trying to cobble together the right language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| And we might need to let Mr. Donaldson and his folk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| who can think of all the variations on the theme with our direction on kind of what we're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| and come back with some good solid language for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| So, you know, I want to vote for the motion to send it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| and I think we would be well served if we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Yeah, I'm confused, because I look at what we've got, and I'm on page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| and it has the current language and the new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| And if we do, you know, section B, permitted uses, use by right, and change that line to 750, we've got our cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| The next one just says structures permitted on review, use on review, change that number to 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| I think we've got what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| And am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| I'm missing something, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| What am I missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Because they actually, MPC actually had a motion to move that number to 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| I think you're missing what Mr. Donaldson said a minute ago, you're missing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| It's sort of like a net or a web, so that if you pull one string out, you mess with the other string.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6045)|
| 1:40:54| And it's a totally different animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| When you take one of those things out, it becomes a totally different thing that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| At least it's substantively different than an executive director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| And if it's substantively different to him, then I don't want to have to defend it in court if somebody attacks it later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| But, I mean, MPC considered changing that number to 750 and to 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| I don't see what the, and it would have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| I mean, nobody in MPC said, oh, I'm sorry, that will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| What we considered was the threshold by which you move from a use by right to a use on review, not a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6087)|
| 1:41:37| That's not the way I heard it, but that's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| I guess, I mean, it sounds like the experts say we have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6100)|
| 1:41:49| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| Well, I think it's fine to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| But somehow we just can't go back with no timetable and no sense of immediacy, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6114)|
| 1:42:04| because actually what we heard at BZA was a situation where someone without a permit went ahead and has built a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6124)|
| 1:42:15| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| And without any permit, it's very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| It's not what the area should be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| And it's a very complicated mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| So, Mr. Dawson, what I'm feeling is I think going, I understand the need to go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| but I just feel that this is probably something that really needs to be treated quickly and dealt with quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| so that we don't have more situations like this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| popping up while it's known out there that we're trying to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| So I don't know if we can put some kind of a, no, no, we can't put more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| Do you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| You can express your sense of urgency to MPC, but they are a totally separate body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| You can really, you cannot dictate to them the timetable under which they operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| but you can certainly suggest to the executive director that council has a sense of urgency about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| and would like it to be handled as rapidly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| And I suspect they'll listen to you because you do a lot with their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| Sir, could I possibly suggest that you understand the sense of urgency with which we would be sending this back to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| And I think you do because a community, a neighborhood can be very damaged by some activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6208)|
| 1:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| Right now the motion is to refer back also with a noted sense of urgency to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| Are there any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| Referred back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| 12D is an ordinance to rezone property from R2 General Residential District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| and A1 General Commercial to C4 Highway and Arterial Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| Property located on the southeast side of Old Callaghan Drive, west of Callaghan Drive, Elaine Bicker's applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6243)|

| 1:44:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| Mr. Baird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| I want to offer an amendment that we change this to C6 instead of C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| I think C6 allows some planning to happen, review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| I think it does a much better job in an area that, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| I don't think we're doing a particularly good job of planning and development with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| I think the applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| Ms. Vickers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Could you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| I think we have a map handed out that shows the commercial areas that's colored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| that shows some of this, the way this lines up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| Ms. Vickers, I think the suggestion has been made by Councilman Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| that this be zoned C6 instead of C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| I'm not sure if you're aware of all the differences there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| but that's what Councilman Becker has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| I don't know really personally if that is a property to zone from C4 to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6306)|
| 1:45:14| I'm not really knowledgeable about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Mr. Dawson, can you give her a quick thumbnail of the difference in C4 and C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| As it relates to what she's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Yeah, particularly for her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| I'm not aware of what particular uses have been discussed with any future development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| but in general the C4 uses are relatively broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6332)|
| 1:45:41| C6 contains a lot of comparable uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| The difference is that C6 requires staff approval of landscape plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| and has a different set of setbacks which would, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| reduce the building envelope upon which any new construction could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6355)|
| 1:46:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| If I could make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| Sure, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6370)|

| 1:46:29| And we have held on to the property for quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| and we're trying to make the property attractive to potential buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| We had a potential buyer earlier this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| and zoning wasn't able to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| commercial zoning wasn't able to be completed by the time our contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| anyway, that fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| So the four children of Allen Lineback decided to go ahead and move with zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| and we wanted to have it comparable to zoning that is exactly beside it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| which is C4, and across the street, and I've got the whole MPC thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| We wanted it attractive but not a whole lot different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| So it wouldn't be a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| And we've also considered and had hoped for there to be maybe a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| not that there was a great, great plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| but that we could join property together so it would be appealing to a buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| So, you know, it's all going commercial out there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| And whenever I applied for the zoning changes in early October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6448)|
| 1:47:36| I'm not being certainly an expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| I asked for C5 or C6, didn't know exactly what I needed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| but I was told by MPC, the fellow that I talked with and met with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| that C4 would probably be the best use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| So that's what we went for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| And then learning more about it and getting maps and all, as it turns out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| the property beside us is C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| And since MPC approved this 12 to 0, as it all turns out, and our realtor is here also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6479)|
| 1:48:09| the gentleman that has the property beside us that is C4 wants to purchase our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6489)|
| 1:48:17| And I firmly believe that keeping our property zone the same, his is C4 and wants our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6497)|
| 1:48:26| and that's what we asked for and that's what was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Thank you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Did you have a follow-up to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Well, it's a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Well, when I talked to Mr. Vickers, I think it's an automotive type business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| Isn't it the same one that's down the road across the street that's going to be relocating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| And I actually think they may have the all-in-one or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6528)|
| 1:48:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| The name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| But I actually think they actually have some tire displays that are outside and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| And from talking to her, and I haven't talked to the person that's wanting to purchase the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| but, you know, this looks like to me from looking at the map here that we have that C4 is appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6549)|
| 1:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| I guess we had a good discussion about the property on Sanderson earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| and we moved into a motion to postpone, Mr. Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| and you answered that question about the staff and what they recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| And I think what I was going to talk about is that MPC takes some direction from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| We came in, at least all of us really, when there was an R1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| and we talked about the need to protect neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| and we've got an R1EN and moving towards an R1HK, and we've got an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6586)|
| 1:49:54| I think that what was just explained is sort of an example of, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| how we need to give better direction to our planners about what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| I'm very bothered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| This council has talked a lot about how we would prefer C6 to C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| and yet somebody walks in and apparently says, can we be C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| And you're told by MPC, no, you want C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| And I think we've got to do a better job at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| at directing MPC to say that we do care about all our neighborhoods, this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| the one off Sanderson, the one off Shasta, by taking some hard stands and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| no, this should be C6, that if this is going to be commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| we want it the kind of commercial that has some landscaping at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| When you talk about outside tire displays, maybe there's a place where that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| I think that I want, before somebody is doing some outside tire display in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| I want somebody to review that and have some ability to talk about landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| So I think C6 will work better for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| I think it's unfortunate that we've got a lot of C4 around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| Mom used to say two wrongs don't make a right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| and I think continuing down a path of mistakes isn't what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| So I think C6 is the right zone for the city on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| Mr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| Based on what Councilman Becker just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| how would this council help MPC and MPC staff focus in that direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6677)|
| 1:51:26| Because apparently what's happening now is that there's a tendency very often to recommend C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| And if this council were to agree with Councilman Becker, which I find myself leaning towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6693)|
| 1:51:41| how would we get that message through to MPC and MPC staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6701)|
| 1:51:50| Well, it would be very easy to get the message across through a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| but if I could just relate to you the differences between C4 and C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| which perhaps lie in the titles of the two districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| C6 is called General Commercial Park District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| and it has the landscaping requirements in there because the intent was to look at large parcels that act together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6728)|
| 1:52:17| and individual businesses that act within a park together compared to the C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| which is titled Highway and Arterial Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| Obviously, we're along Callahan here, which is a major arterial in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| and better suited to deal with parcel-by-parcel types of rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6754)|
| 1:52:43| The C6 doesn't have any minimum district requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| but it's pretty clearly written to think in terms of larger parcels and in a park-like setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6767)|
| 1:52:55| And it's very difficult when you're dealing with very narrow parcels to apply the C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| In this case, the C6 setbacks remove 20 percent of the building area on this particular lot, which is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6781)|
| 1:53:10| It's 10,000 square feet that are taken off of the table because of the setback requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| That's good feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| I guess what strikes me as you're speaking on this is that maybe what we need to do is begin to think in terms of kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6798)|
| 1:53:29| revisiting the way we're zoning, which we're talking about doing anyway with form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| and we may not get there all in one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| It may not make sense to say we're going to do form-based code on every arterial and major collector, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6817)|
| 1:53:47| Coming out of the gate, that's a huge undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| But maybe we can begin to look at setting guidelines for corridors, for strips, for areas, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6831)|
| 1:53:58| because I think what I'm hearing is that C6 doesn't get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| Thank you. Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| First, this does not front on Callahan Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| and also it only has C4 zoning on part of the property, alongside part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| It's got R2 around it and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| And secondly, C6 was not considered at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| It's not in the staff report, and it was passed on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| So to consider C6, it would have to go back to MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Okay, right now the motion on the floor, though, is to amend to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| I call my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Actually, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Well, let me just say, Mr. Frost, too, I do have respect for, as a lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| just the point that this would have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| Mr. Swanson, do you agree with that analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| I'd just like to clarify with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| I look in my record, and I see no indication that the Metropolitan Planning Commission considered C6 for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6898)|
| 1:55:06| Is there something I'm missing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| I actually said I asked for C6, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| I'm asking if the Metropolitan Planning Commission, not some staff member somewhere, actually considered C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6912)|
| 1:55:22| They recommended C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| The Planning Commission, I'm looking, I think we approved it on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| so there probably was no consideration of anything other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| Do you find anything in the record that would suggest that the Metropolitan Planning Commission, not the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| but the Metropolitan Planning Commission considered C6 for this parcel of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| The agenda item was approved on consent, so there was no consideration in public forum by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6945)|
| 1:55:55| Then the appropriate motion would be to refer back to MPC and ask them to consider C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| Let me look, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| I didn't have any expectation that Mr. Swanson would disagree with you, but I figured it was worth a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6961)|
| 1:56:07| I will withdraw my motion to amend it to C6 and instead make a motion to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6967)|
| 1:56:19| There's a motion and a second to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| I don't have a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| I just want to point out that right across O'Callaghan Drive from my dad's property is a 10,000-foot warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6991)|
| 1:56:39| I only see one C6 zoned property in that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=6999)|
| 1:56:48| And, you know, reading through all the comments from MPZ zoning, C4 zoning, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| or an extension of GC designation and C4 zoning found in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| General commercial designation and C4 zoning will allow commercial development of the property that is in character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| with other recent development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| And, I mean, it goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| So, you know, we can bounce this back to MPZ zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| I have got siblings to report to in Idaho, North Carolina, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7032)|
| 1:57:18| And, you know, it's taken us a long time to move my dad's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| Currently, it's laying there in disrepair, vagrants on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7043)|
| 1:57:29| And, you know, I strongly suggest we move ahead with the C4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7049)|
| 1:57:37| I've been down this road and I'd like to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| Mr. Donaldson, in reference to what you just stated a few minutes ago about the C6 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| would this lot be appropriate because of the size for C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| I think the C6 certainly puts some constraints on it that are greater than C4 just in terms of the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| and the building envelope due primarily to the narrowness of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7081)|
| 1:58:08| and to the adjoining residential zone districts which kick in a higher or a larger setback requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7088)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Mr. Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| Mr. Donaldson, as the applicant mentioned, there is a parcel close by that's zone C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7100)|
| 1:58:27| It's 1917 Old Callaghan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| It's on the other side of Old Callaghan Drive east of where this parcel in question abuts, Old Callaghan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7109)|
| 1:58:38| And it's isolated, as she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| It's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| There's C3 next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| There's agricultural, I think, A1 on the other side, on the east side, and then C4 after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7124)|
| 1:58:51| Do you have any idea, and then R2 across the street from it, do you have any idea why that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7131)|
| 1:58:58| which is probably roughly equivalent in area to the parcel in question, why that one was zone C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7138)|
| 1:59:06| The C6 parcel that I'm looking at is probably twice the size of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| It's narrower but not as wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| It's half again as wider, according to the map that I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| Maybe I'm looking at, I thought we were talking about the A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| There's a C3 directly across as well that's narrower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| Maybe I'm confusing which one is the applicant's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| You know, I'm with this lady who wants to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| Honestly, I spend a lot of time at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| I just told the vice mayor, I don't know why I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| There must be something wrong with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| And I truly mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| But, you know, this was passed on consent at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| Let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| She asked for advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| She went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| She was advised that C4 was what would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| Actually, she's lost one buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| Did I hear you correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Now, she is fortunate enough to have a neighbor who is interested in her property at the same zoning as his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7211)|
| 2:00:19| Understandably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Mr. Donaldson has told us that, you know, this is a small lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| We can look at that and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| And she was, you know, she's going to lose a great deal of that footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7226)|
| 2:00:31| I just personally cannot try to repair all of the ills that we've visited on the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| over the last 17-something when Knoxville became a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| Tonight, and I just feel that this woman is in a very difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| She has siblings who are expecting to get an answer out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| They have an opportunity to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| The adjacent property is on C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| I'm going to have to support her because I think we have years ahead of us that we can repair some of these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7255)|
| 2:01:03| But I don't know that we need to start tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| And that's what I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| I guess I'll address Ms. Vickers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| I think we should explain that Old Callaghan has sort of been something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| I don't know if you heard some of the jokes earlier about Old Callaghan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| but there's been something that's been a real concern to me since I came on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| I was raised there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| I have a sense of what I want the city I live in to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| And one of the few tools that we have to deal with it actually is zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| It's a clear power we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| And I want to do the good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| And, you know, Ms. Pelo, I think every time something comes up, there's a good reason to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| and that's why we get all the mistakes we've made for centuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| And I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| And I think we've got to draw the line someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| And I think we start it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| And, you know, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| I actually don't think I'm going to win this one any more than I've won any of the last ones on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| But I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| So I think we should send this back to MPC and begin now doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7323)|
| 2:02:10| Mr. Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| Well, Councilman Becker, I agree with where you want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| I don't think this is going to get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| I don't think we have the choices that can be put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| I don't think C-6 works here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| And I don't think we have the choices in our smorgasbord of zones to really address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7349)|
| 2:02:36| So my tendency, while I'm very sympathetic and would like to support what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| I don't see us getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Even if we send it back to MPC, I don't see them having necessarily the choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| I don't think C-6 is probably going to work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| So I go back to Mr. Donaldson's suggestion that if we want to see movement in a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7373)|
| 2:03:01| a resolution from Council would have a real impact with MPC and with the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| and they'd begin to take seriously the need for some changes in commercial zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| and so I think that's where I'd like to see us go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| So I really can't support sending it back right now because I don't think we've got a good option if we send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7397)|
| 2:03:26| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Briefly, I think sending it back allows MPC to consider what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| and see if there are other ways to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| I think we've seen some remarkable things come out of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| I think they can do a better job than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| Right now the motion on the floor is to refer it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7423)|

| 2:03:46| I heard Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| Were there any other ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7429)|

| 2:03:54| I heard eight noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| Now we're back to the original motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Are there any additional comments there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| The motion is to approve what's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil071120?start=7444)|
