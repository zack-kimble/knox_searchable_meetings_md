| 0:02:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Let's move to item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| Consideration of suspension, revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| Quick shop number 24, 7657 Clinton Highway, Marsco LLC owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| And this is not third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| This is their second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Did you say it was their second offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| I heard it on here, but it's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Sir, state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Danny Blackburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| And address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| 253 Bailington Road, Greenville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| Let's hear from the sheriff's department first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=213)|
| 0:03:44| The 18th day of November, this is from 2004, but it's within the three-year time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=224)|
| 0:03:53| Caroline Love was cited for the underage sale of a six-pack of Budweiser to an underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=233)|
| 0:04:05| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| You're obviously aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| What is your response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| On that citation there, I've only been with the company for a year, so anything up until now I'm not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| I have the second citation here that was written on the 9th of May, 2007, to a Darlene Brewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| and that happened at 7657 Clinton Highway at the Quick Shop, the sale of an alcohol beverage to an underage person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:40| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| What's your response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Our response is that we continuously try to encourage our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| and train our employees to defer them from selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| I feel like the new Tennessee law, the universal carding, will help a lot of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| Ms. Brewer had only been employed with us for only 35 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| So this is kind of devastating to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| And there's not too much to say, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| Has there been any resolution of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| It's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| It's not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| Anything else you'd like to say, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| I feel like that this is a very good store for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| And, you know, since my employment here, I've been trying to do a lot of things to help improve a lot of these issues that we're faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:48| How long have you been with the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Just one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Mr. Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| What is the normally allowed time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Somebody goes to work at a quick shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| Is there a period of time that they have as a grace period before they have to have the training, the sales training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=365)|
| 0:06:16| I believe it's 30 days, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| You know, he says this person, you know, they still need to be aware of the law, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| And was this person a supervisory position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| This person was just a sales associate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| You know, basically the way I see it, they are somewhat at risk during that 30-day period, and it is up to the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| I mean, it's not a freebie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| When a sales associate is hired, they go through an orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| It is discussed with them about the universal carding and carding everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| And Ms. Brewer was scheduled to go to her tips class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| We had scheduled that from the date of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| You know, I mean, I'm really concerned about this one because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| a person really doesn't have to have a whole lot of training to understand that in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| you've got to be 21 years old before you can purchase alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| And I'm very familiar with the business, and it's a great asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| It's not far from my home and from my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| And, you know, what I'm concerned about, this is a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| What kind of guarantees can we get that there won't be a third offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| We have a real problem on Clinton Highway with alcohol and young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| I frequently do ride-alongs with the DUI task force, and we have a lot of problems out on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=472)|
| 0:08:01| And what kind of assurances can we have from you that we're not going to have a third offense of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| It would be just the ongoing training and continually orientating the new sales associates and how serious that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:20| I've also got an intercompany mystery shopper that goes around and does, it's in the stores at least every two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| doing basically the same things that you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Can you tell me whether the, was this an undercover officer that he sold alcohol to or to just someone when coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:43| Undercover officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| It was an undercover officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| What are your options on this one, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Well, for a second offense, I mean, I'd hate to pull a license for a second offense, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| For a second offense, which is within the first 36 months of the first, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| and that is the reason that we're only considering this as a second offense instead of a third offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| because the other one was prior to the 36-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| For sale to a minor, a 60-day suspension or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=559)|
| 0:09:28| This was sale to a minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| So you're, I mean, that is, that's the options that the board has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Would you be agreeable to a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| You would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| And would that, is that enough of a wake-up call to get you all to step up your training process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| I would think it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| $1,000 is a lot of money for a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| And would the sheriff's department be okay with a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| I'd like to make the motion that we fine them $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| First and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Commissioner Norman, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| That's good enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| There's been a motion made and seconded that the fine will be $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| And the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| You know, you've got a 30-day period to make sure that all your employees who are going to serve, you know, beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| or sell beer, that they go through the training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| But, you know, they need to be supervised during that period of time so that an improper sale doesn't occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:42| But you've got 30 days by an ordinance passed by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| I really want to say I think that this is a place that really needs a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| There are several neighborhoods that people can walk to the quick stop just across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| And I think it's nice that we have it that convenient so that, you know, maybe it will keep some people from driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| But I just really think we need to get that under control because there's a lot of alcohol problems on Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| with various wrecks and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| And I may be a little more aware of it because I live right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| But, you know, like I said, I just hope we won't be seeing you again anytime soon except when I stop in the store myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| We'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=685)|

| 0:22:42| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Gracious God, we thank you for this day that you've entrusted to us, a day in which you've called us to serve you and to serve one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| God, we pray that as the elected and appointed officials of this county come together, Lord, that they would use your wisdom in the decisions that they make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1373)|
| 0:23:02| that it might be for the betterment of the community in which we all live, work, and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| God, we pray that you would return a normalcy to a community that is torn by controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| God, that healing would take place as we ask that your will would be done in the community known as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1397)|

| 0:23:32| For it's in Jesus Christ's name we do pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1412)|

| 0:23:37| Thank you, Pastor Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| This month, the pledge will be by, I think, Commissioner Mike Hammond has someone, so Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I'd like to call to the podium Gunnery Sergeant Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Gunnery Sergeant Caldwell is here representing the Delta Marines located on the Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| He is in the logistics office, and he will be leading us in our pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| And, Sergeant Caldwell, thank you, sir, for your service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:28| Okay, as we begin today, I'd like to just say I've written something down here I'd just like to say to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| If you all would allow me that privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| So, without objection, as we begin today, as a point of personal privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| I want to share my perspective as chairman and how we should proceed through this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| The past year has certainly been a challenging time for Knox County, and change is never easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| and extraordinary changes stemming from the Supreme Court ruling upholding term limits were certainly no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| Much has been written and said about the process to comply with that ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| Even so, we did not create the process of the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| It was a direction by the Supreme Court, and our first priority was to follow the letter of that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:22| And I am confident, however, that each and every member of this commission is committed to maintain trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| and confidence that Knox County government is both responsible and accountable to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| During the past few months, troubling revelations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| and serious allegations have been made regarding the conduct of the executive branch in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| No doubt some of these issues will be brought before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| As a legislative body, we are charged with the responsibility of oversight in regards to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| and policies that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| As we proceed, certain difficult questions will be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| They must be asked and answered to promote sound decision-making and how to proceed from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:11| My commitment as chairman is to keep these proceedings civil, open, and constructive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| rather than devices which will only serve to erode citizens' confidence in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| I appreciate the privilege to say those few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Now we'll move on to the amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| I'd like to add anything that's to be added and withdraw or defer any item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:45| We have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| This is Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Would this include the resolution that was passed out here just a few minutes ago with regards to the matching funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| for transportation for the hay for the farmers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| If not, I would like to add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Do we have an objection to add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Seeing no objections, it will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Does the motion to add all things include the resolution passed out by the law director regarding the redo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| We can't hear your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| You might be up on it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Does the resolution to include all items to be added include the resolution distributed by the law director regarding a redo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:29| I don't know if it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Unless we have objections, do we have objections to adding the court ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| I believe that should be handled separately as an amendment to the agenda rather than the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| He wants to take a vote to see if it's to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| I think the law director's redo motion should be a separate vote as to whether it should be added to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| and not combined with other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| We have a resolution passed out by the county law director to the redo, I guess a settlement offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1676)|
| 0:28:08| Yeah, it is a process where we would go through a redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| I mean, if you want to take that up separately, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| We'll take that up certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| We'll take it up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I guess we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| It has to have two-thirds approval by this commission to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| I guess we'll do it by roll call starting, I guess, in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| This is to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Yeah, I'm going to vote yes to add it, but I'm not for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| It has to have discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1726)|

| 0:29:00| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1740)|

| 0:29:04| Commissioner Frank Leithode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1744)|

| 0:29:07| Commissioner Kay Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1747)|

| 0:29:10| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1750)|

| 0:29:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1754)|

| 0:29:24| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:37| We had eight ayes and ten noes, so the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| It will not be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| I mean, be on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| On 801 and 802 or, I'm sorry, 101 and 102 on the consent calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| if I could have those for 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| On page 2, 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Page 3, 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Page 3, 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| He would like to hear next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Without objections, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Mr. Chairman, could we move ordinance 101, the stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| to the front just after consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| We've got a motion or got a recommendation to move the stormwater 101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Can we do that without objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Hey, I don't see any objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Mr. Chairman, I think some other people wanted to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| A public forum, moving that because there's some people that need to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| and did not want to be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| We could have them before stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Stormwater is going to be pretty lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| You mean you want to bring public forum to the front of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| I have an objection over that because we've told people to be here at 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| for the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Four o'clock is our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| What time is the public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Public forum is usually at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| which would normally be around 4 or 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| I'll withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| We'll move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| You want them before consent, Commissioner Smith, or after consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| After consent will be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| After consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Mr. Chairman, just as a procedural cleaning up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| I don't think we actually had a vote to add the items other than the redo to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| and we probably should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| We did it without objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Bruce Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Does that include the two maintenance agreements that we handed out as far as being added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1908)|
| 0:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I don't have them, but we'll add those two maintenance agreements without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| One other item, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Resolution 405, which is on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| We'd like to have that withdrawn from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| That intersection is actually inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Without objections, we'll withdraw 405 on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Seeing no objections, it's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| No other amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Mr. Chairman, I may have misspoke on that public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| We want to make sure that those people are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| If you want to just go down that ABCD list and just see if they're here, we don't want to do it if they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| Well, we've got why don't we hold it to just after zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| That way it's not going to push it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Commissioner, why don't we just, if someone's here to speak on stormwater or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| let's let them speak, I guess, during the debate of stormwater for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| And a lot of them have what they're wanting to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| We'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| We won't have them at the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| We'll just try to get them in as the issue comes up so that we don't pass something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| and at the end they get to talk about something that's already been passed or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Mr. Chairman, I just want to double check on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Resolution 505, I believe that was withdrawn in committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Is it still withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I want to make sure it hadn't popped up again by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:41| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| What page is it on, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| It was listed to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2028)|

| 0:33:58| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Mr. Chairman, procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| It appears there may be a couple of other items we could put on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Do we do this now or when we get on the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| We can do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| And if anybody doesn't want to do this, that's obviously fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2055)|

| 0:35:07| If it's got a star beside it, it's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2107)|

| 0:35:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| 9-05 wouldn't be on consent because it was amended, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2123)|

| 0:41:10| Okay. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Mr. Chairman, I have a question on 402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| I'm here from Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| Is John Evans here or someone from his department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Or Bruce, you can handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| What we're doing over here at the Powell Convention, we're leasing the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Do we normally lease the land where we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| We do not buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| I mean, what's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Didn't we buy the halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| We're leasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| And I think if memory serves correct, I think we lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Of course, this is a short-term lease at Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| We're building the new center, which should be done within the next probably next 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| We also lease the property at Carter, and I believe we lease the site in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| I think those are the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| And I think the main reason we're leasing those sites, I believe we've approached about buying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| and they didn't show any interest in buying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| And, as you know, relocating the convenience center gets to be rather problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| I'd like to know if we can, if we can buy where we can, because we're planning to be there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Do we have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| That's just weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Commissioner Bolus, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Clerk, if you'll go to page 19, stormwater ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee adopting the stormwater management ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2559)|
| 0:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Do we have a motion to approve, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| Make a motion to approve the original motion, the ordinance, with none of the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Seconded by Commissioner Frank Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Commissioner Norman first and then I'll get to you and Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| I'll defer to Commissioner Harmon about procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| I would like to make a substitute motion here to divide the motion to consider first what is labeled Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:42| You can call it the Harmon Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| The following page you can call it the Norman Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| The page after that you can call it the Lambert Amendment, all named after the authors as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| And finally, the stormwater ordinance itself in any amended form as the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| So we would divide the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Do the three amendments first and then discuss and debate each one and vote on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| And then we would take up the overall ordinance in whatever final form it emerged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Seconded by Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Well, once there's something on the floor, everything else would, in fact, be an amendment to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:30| and would whatever amendment first you would dispose of that so we would get to the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| I don't know why we would need one to do that because that is, in fact, the order that would be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| If I may respond to Commissioner Lizold's question, I believe this is just for the purpose of orderly debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| I mean, granted, but if you just bring up the amendment itself, the ordinance itself with no amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| granted anybody could bring up an amendment at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| but I think it would be more orderly to handle the amendments first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| and then the ordinance in whatever final form it emerged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| You know, I go to Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| You put something on the floor and then you amend from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| So, obviously, you need the main part of the ordinance that's proposed and then amendments from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| I never heard of taking amendments first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| You take that and they stand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| And if one amendment passes, well, then that's part of the motion from then on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| And then other amendments can go from there that meant other parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| You can have so I never heard of taking amendments first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| I mean, granted, the assumption of taking amendments first is that the ordinance itself has been introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| But if you'd want to do it in another order, I won't object as long as all three amendments get consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| Well, I think they're well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| The question I have here is for the I don't know who should answer, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| I have something in my hands here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| It says the following proposed amendments to the stormwater management ordinance are recommended for approval by the Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| Bruce, is that is this what you are submitting from your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:11| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| If the maker of the motion would make it part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| I'll make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| I'll make that part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| It's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| So we need to know that that's part of the original motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| Well, I don't know that we did you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| I will withdraw my substitute motion for the sake of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| My motion is to go along with the original ordinance with those amendments added by Bruce Weichert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Frank with no degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| I was going to make a substitute motion that we pass with my amendments intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| But I guess we're debating those separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Could I address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| The ones that stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| They hand those out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| He's already resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| I felt compelled being so involved with water throughout my career that I thought that it would be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:28| to start this debate about stormwater with a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| You all have heard me speak before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| You've read my letter and my facts about the amendments that we've worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| And I've worked with several people, both on the commission and on the county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| And this is a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| So I just wanted to take a few minutes to start out this debate with some observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2874)|
| 0:48:03| First of all, stormwater, the fact that it is stormwater, what an interesting use of terms at this time for us in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:13| Stormy times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| To me, it really is just a water issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| And what we're talking about as an ordinance is a water ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| And there is my first attempt probably at legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| There's a lot of famous phrases about legislation, about making sausage and such things as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| There's the thing that I think of when I think of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| Another phrase or catch phrase is that a lot of legislation involves the art of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:55| And on some issues, I think that's absolutely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| But there are some things that we can see that are, without a doubt, right and true and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:07| And certainly there is a place for no compromise on issues such as these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| And I think we're approaching some of those types of issues when we talk about water and stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| There's three points that I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| One, water is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| It's a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| It is a commodity that we need to place great value on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| Number two, the essence of this ordinance is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| And it is about protection, protection of the public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| Number three is there is an aspect of this ordinance that could involve judges and judgments and courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:59| And we are, of course, very familiar with courts and judgments right now in our status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| First of all, water is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| It's part of our heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| It's part of our inheritance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| We love water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| We don't just value water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| We love water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| We love the sight of it bubbling over rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| We love the sounds of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| We love the smell of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| We love water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| It's part of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| It's part of who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| It seems ironic almost to me that we even consider writing ordinances that might allow room for people to abuse water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:54| It's just unfathomable almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3054)|
| 0:51:03| There's many things that connect, of course, to the water issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| Our hillsides, our buffer zones for creeks and streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| I'm amazed a lot of times when I look to the hills around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| and I see bulldozers that are allowed to go right to the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| scraping off field dirt for some project in some blood plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:30| It's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| The commission is familiar with some very contemporary issues such as farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| such as Laura Cole and Laura Cole's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| And we're all big orange fans until our fields turn orange and our streams turn orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| And we know that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| And we know it's wrong to go to Ms. Cole and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| I'm sorry, but there is no violation of our stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:09| Now, I believe that was my first point, and that was too lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| My second point, this is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| This is a simple issue of protection of public welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| It is, if we stack the regulations and the manuals up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| and we listen to the technocrats about it, it is not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| When we talk about the engineering aspects of the various requirements, it is not simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| But it is simple when we talk about its essence, and that is we're not going to pollute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| We don't tolerate pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| That is a simple concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| If somebody goes, is driving down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| and they throw a piece of paper out of their car, we're appalled at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| We should be equally appalled at the things we do to water and allow to be done to water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| I think the city agreement that we have is almost a non-issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| It's important because it can serve as a guide for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| But really, to me, I think what we're about is something far beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| We're about, we should be about making an ordinance that's a model for East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:30| We ought to be a leader in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| It ought to be an identity for us in Knox County of what we've done for water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| and why we're doing that, how we value it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| And so I hope that if we don't get it right this time, we'll come back next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| and we'll continue to work at this until we do get it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| and we are a model for the communities that are around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| The last issue about judgment, there is, we are subject to higher authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| We're subject to a higher authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| But certainly, in terms of the courts, there are things that can face us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| We are aware of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| We're aware of the law of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| The law of the land is called the Clean Water Act, and we're supposed to obey that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| And that's what this ordinance should align with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| It should align with that federal law where we can and we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| we are about to face some judgments from those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| So, I'll sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Let us not compromise on these things that we think that we know in our hearts are good and right and true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:53| I urge you to vote on the strict interpretation and amendments to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| Our citizens overwhelmingly expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| I'd like to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3310)|
| 0:55:26| I really hadn't written a speech today, and I hadn't planned on addressing this body in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| There's nobody out there that wants to pollute the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| This is a valuable ordinance that we desperately need so that we can deal with water issues appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:48| But at the same time, while we have certain activists within this community that are speaking strictly for the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| they're only seeing one side of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| And there's two sides to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| There's also the hardworking folks that are going to have to comply with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| and that are going to have to live with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| And I think that we need to pass a strong ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| But I've offered several amendments that will make this a more reasonable ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| The building industry and the developing industry is already experiencing some slowdowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| and our economy is suffering because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| And, you know, I come here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| I'm not very good with tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| The more I try to fix things or try to build things, the more I mess things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| I can't build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| I can't plumb houses, and I can't wire houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| But one thing I can do, I can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| And I'm here today speaking for the hardworking folks that are out there working hard every day to feed their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| and driving this economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| And I know we need to pass an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| And I'm ready to pass a very strong ordinance so that we deal with water appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| But one thing that we don't need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| we don't need to let the environmentalist agenda of a few cause us to pass an ordinance that this industry can't live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:10| We don't want to kill off this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| We want this industry to start dealing with storm water a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| And I think most of the folks within the industry are in agreement with that, and they're ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| But one thing that we need to do, we as commissioners need to balance what we pass here today for concerns for the working folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3442)|
| 0:57:31| who are going to have to live under the ordinance that we create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| And so I hope that you folks will support my amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| And, again, you know, I'm able to compromise on some of them, but some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| there is no way the industry can live with some of these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| I know, for instance, in one portion of this ordinance, environmental protection is written in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| Well, now, it's great to take care of the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| It's great to look out for endangered species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| But that's not our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| That's the federal government's place, and that's the job of the EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| And we need to let the EPA do their job, and we need to stay out of their way on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| This ordinance is about dealing with storm water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| and I think that we need to stick with dealing with storm water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| and not let this ordinance be hijacked by some of the more radical environmental interests within this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Okay, we've got a couple of people that signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| If the commission would like to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Commissioner Cate, do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Chris or Bruce, if I've seen a copy of those recent amendments you passed out, I've lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| They actually should have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| I don't know if they're in your packet, but they weren't handed out recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| I think we got them together Thursday or Friday and sent them out then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| I'm not sure if they were in your packet or they were faxed to you or how they got to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| Commissioner Leuthold, since he has them, he might be able to tell you where he found his, but that's how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| I don't have copies of them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| Me neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Commissioner Harmon doesn't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Commissioner Trammell doesn't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| I don't recall where I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| I just have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| I remember them being in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| I was thinking it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| It probably is in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Of course, your packet, as you know, is that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Just as a point, Joe Lebonavita has gone to copy it and pass it out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:32| Bruce, those were actual amendments or that's where you're trying to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| They were in response to your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| I believe you made a request at the Intergovernmental Committee that we essentially give our recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| as to the three different proposals, and that was included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| So you took all three proposals as far as amendments and took a look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| and recommended which of those that you felt comfortable with, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| In fact, Mr. Grange, you actually did the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| And, Bruce, you may well have faxed them to me at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| I've used about a ream of fax paper this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| Yes, we need to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| Let's make one comment real briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| Commissioner Lambert brought up the Environmental Protection Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| There are certain things in this ordinance that, quite frankly, are non-negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| They are mandated by the Clean Water Act, and that happens to be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| There are certain things in there that just have to be in there, and the EPA reference is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| Bruce, you said that you all, or Chris, looked at all three amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| What's the recommendation from the engineering department on all three of these recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| I think we took each individual comment, each individual recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| We didn't take it as recommendation one, two, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| There were several comments in each recommendation, and we addressed each one individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| So it's without the sheet in front of me, Mr. Grangi has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| He can probably explain in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| But it wasn't like we were for one, against two, and for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| There were several recommendations with each one, and we referenced each and every recommendation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Bruce, did you all have any problem at all with the amendments Mr. Lambert has put forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| I'm going to ask Mr. Grangi to speak to a couple of them, but certainly the reference to the 500-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| Knox County has been using the 500-year floodplain for at least as long as I've been working here, so that's in excess of 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:43| We would not be in favor of changing that or reducing it to the 100-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Now, developers and engineers may not be aware that we've been using the 500-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| because they rely on us for the information in regards to floor elevations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| Quite frankly, we've been using that for in excess of 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| The other concern is in reference to the sinkhole, the changes to the sinkhole requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| We were not in favor of that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Those are the two that stood out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I probably need Mr. Grangi to go into more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| Everything else seemed to be okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| He did bring up the pipe issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Quite frankly, our position on the pipe issue is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| is that all three pipe materials will perform adequately if installed correctly and sized correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| We think this is more of an economic decision, something that the community and you all need to decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| We think it is less of an engineering decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Commissioner Catewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| I just want to make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Mr. Grangi took the three amendments and looked at everything in those three amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| and put the best of all of it into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Let me make one clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| We have not changed the wording in the ordinance whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| The ordinance you have is just that what we did is a separate sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| and just gave you our recommendations as to the recommendations we received from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| So whenever we get this piece of paper, it will have the original ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| and then your recommendations for the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| And those recommendations are based on the three amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| Actually, the recommendations, I think the request was basically to give our response to the suggested amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:33| And so out of the list, and there were a lot of suggestions for amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| we chose the ones that we recommended support of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| And it's about a page, just a little bit over a page, probably with less spacing it would be less than a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| Can I see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Can we see that document and soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| It's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Jolie, how long will we get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Is she making copies of it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Yes, she's making copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| As soon as she gets done, she'll bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| This is just the first reading, so it will come back to us in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| I wanted to ask Bruce a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| You mentioned about if it is installed properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| and I have had people mention to me that installation is the key regardless of the material used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| How many inspectors do you have to go out and inspect the sites to make sure that it is installed properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| Currently, I believe we have seven inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Is that enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Commissioner, I get asked that, and I don't mean to waffle on the answer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| I get asked that question quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| We certainly can do our job with that many inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| Ideally, you'd want an inspector on every job site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| Realistically, obviously that can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| So we're providing the best level of service with the inspectors you all provide us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| One scenario is we require concrete on rights of way into the detention ponds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| Another is to allow the engineering to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| I would imagine that would be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Is that correct, or your office would make the determination as to which material would be suitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| Yes, sir, and just so you know, currently Knox County does allow corrugated metal in the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| and under pavement on what's referred to as local streets, which are subdivision streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| If it's a higher classification than a local street, then we require concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| And typically those are projects that the county is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| We've been doing this all along, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| I mean, you've been making that determination, that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Yes, sir, we've been doing that for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| Have we had failures with pipes and concrete versus other materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| I've had failures with all classes of pipes with the exception of plastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| I've had concrete pipe failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I've had corrugated metal pipe failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Let me answer your question this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| I think the best way to characterize it is do I have a notebook that I can bring down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| and go page after page where we've had problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| No, sir, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| And that's probably one of the reasons why the county has never pursued this concrete pipe aspect of changing the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| because I don't have a significant number of failures that would warrant us to come down here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| we need to make this specification change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| And was that as a result of the material itself or the installation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:28| It's probably more in the situations that I'm familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| It was installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| It was due to installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Did I understand you to say that we have never had the, it's not called plastic pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| but that's what we commonly refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| We've never had a failure with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| It's relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| I've not had a failure either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| And here again, I'm only aware of, I only know what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| There may have been something that came in that I'm not aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| but we've not had any failures with the plastic pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| It is relatively new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| And certainly from a durability standpoint, it won't last as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Of course, you've got a bunch of concrete pipe salesmen in the audience, both concrete, metal, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| But generally, it's going to last as long as any of the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Bruce, when you say you're leaving the question of the type of pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| and those three specific instances to us and saying it's an economic decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| what you're really saying is that those particular applications eventually become public property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| and become our responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| and that we should choose the one that has the best track record for the long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| to save the taxpayers money in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| That's exactly what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| It's really an economic decision from an engineering standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| All three of those materials will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| It will do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I mean, theoretically, duct tape and chewing gum will work for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| But I mean, I'm talking about the long term and the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| and the fact that this comes over, much of it comes over to public care and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| And that's exactly the decision that we feel like you all need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Question to Bruce or maybe somebody from the pipe people could answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| Bruce, when you're doing this major road project we're going through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| I'm just trying to keep this simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| How big, I know concrete is any size you want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| this firm, rigid plastic pipe that they have now that they're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| do they go up to a certain size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| or do they make that in four foot and six foot section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| or is it just after four foot you go to concrete or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| I'm not sure to what size it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| In some sense, I bet you'd have to ask the sales people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| Anybody here that can answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Can you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| And if you will, give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| And if you work for plastic or concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:17| My name is Howard McGowan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| I work for a company called Advanced Training Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| We're manufacturers of corrugated high-density polyethylene pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| I live in Franklin, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| And I'm the regional engineer for the company here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Your question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| The question is, how big does this plastic pipe go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| In other words, if somebody's doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| homeowners are worried about their subdivisions being built and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| They would know that concrete goes up to a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| and plastic stops at a 12 inch or 24 inch pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| I mean, when do you stop using plastic and from there on it goes concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| if there is such a thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| The largest diameter that we manufacture is 60 inches, five foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| And that would be, can that be used on a highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| In some states, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| In Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Up to 48 inch, four foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| So the biggest you can put in Knox County is four foot of rigid plastic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| If they abide by the Tennessee Department of Transportation specifications, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Mr. Chairman, I want to move from pipe here to sinkholes for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| I noticed that in looking at some of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| it was to delete some sections with regards to the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| We all know we have sinkholes aplenty here in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| Would you address what this ordinance says with regards to those sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| and protection and that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| If you don't mind, I'll let Mr. Grange answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| He knew you'd get your chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| It's my understanding, as you're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| what the ordinance, as it's presented to you, has with regard to sinkhole protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| Basically, limit of fill in sinkhole, protection of the storage volume in a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| Obviously, sinkholes are areas that add as storage for stormwater runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| play a part in groundwater recharge, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| Basically, it's a fairly complicated but workable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| and proven way of addressing development in various range of sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| where the volume of water running off from the developments is limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| and encroachment, in other words, fill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| anything like that placed in the sinkhole is also limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| And the origin, just this may be helpful to know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| the origin of this policy is from a study that we did back in 1998| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| following the extreme flooding in the Dutchtown Road area in Cedar Bluff and West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| And by that, we sort of worked backwards to figure out what caused the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| and what kind of conditions created that sort of flood event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| and created a policy to address those specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| So it can appear rather onerous on the front end, but there's a reason behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| And it's been in effect as a policy in Knox County since 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| So there's really no change in practice that's being suggested by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Bruce or Chris, either one, just so I'm perfectly clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| the type of pipe that you used, if properly installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| has absolutely no effect on water quality or water quantity, assuming proper installation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| No, sir, not in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| We've got a couple of people assigned to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| The first one is Sam Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:33| And, Mr. Parnell, if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:43| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| My name is Sam Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| I live at 9029 Shaliford Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| I don't work for plastic pipe companies or concrete pipe companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| I'm just here as citizen Parnell today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| I do want to address the stormwater ordinance because it's extremely important for responsible quality growth in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| I'm uniquely qualified to address this issue because I have experience with stormwater drainage systems on several fronts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| and I want to share those experiences with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| Before giving the details, let me summarize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| First, as a taxpayer, it is my experience that flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| and choice of pipe materials has not saved the taxpayer one penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| Second, as a civil engineer, I've never had to recommend replacing a failed concrete pipe under a public roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:44| And lastly, as an educator of future public works professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| I request that you implement the stormwater ordinance with concrete pipe in the three critical locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| as originally recommended by your professional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| As a taxpayer, I've been in contact with all of you by letter and some of you by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| I explained to you how I participate in paying for the metal drainage pipe in the subdivision where I live three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| First, in 1975 when I bought the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| The second time in 1989 when the metal pipe rusted out and had to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| And the third time in 2004 when the metal pipe rusted out again and had to be replaced at taxpayer expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:33| The 1989 pipe failure also impacted the county's pavement management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:41| The replacement of the pipe required excavating new asphalt on Chaliford Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| which had recently been repaved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| I contend if concrete pipe had been used under the road when the subdivision was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| I and my neighbors would not be driving over a bump in the road for the past 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| I keep hearing that flexibility to allow other types of pipe under roads besides concrete will help home buyers afford a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:09| I do not believe this can be proven when you put pencil to paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| Those who offer this argument say it loud and often and hope that when they say it loud and often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| then somehow it will become the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| But the truth is that in real life conditions in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| and specifically in Berkshire Woods subdivision where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| the metal pipe under Chaliford Road has failed two times in 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| And as you can see from the picture that I passed around and I sent to you in the mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| the pipe is currently rusting on the bottom and is destined to again fail soon for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:49| The truth is any savings in house price is offset by taxes to pay for the pipe maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| Flexibility in the choice of pipe materials under Chaliford Road has not saved the taxpayers one penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:04| Let me speak now as a civil engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| In my 16 plus years as engineering director for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| time and time again we wrote work orders to the public service department to remove rusted out metal pipe under roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| and replace them with concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Also in my role as engineering director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| I recommended to city council that they authorize and fund construction contracts to replace failed stone culverts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| and rusted out metal pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Example locations that I recall were on Cecil Avenue, Jackson at Willow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| locations in West Hills, Overbrook and Hedge Apple in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| and how can anyone not recall Paper Mill Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Yet after 16 years, I do not recall one time that a work order was sent to the public service department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| or that I made the recommendation to city council to replace a failed concrete pipe under a public roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:07| In fact, I've seen concrete pipe carrying stormwater in Sequoia Hill subdivision that has been in place for almost 100 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| and still functions properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| In closing, I will address the stormwater ordinance as an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| Since my retirement as Knoxville's director of engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| I've taught a graduate level class at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| The name of the class is Urban Systems Engineering Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| Some of those who take the class aspire to be city and county engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| public works directors and city managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| One of the topics in the class is the police power that local government legislative bodies have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| to pass ordinances to ensure orderly growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| I point out to my students that as public works professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| they will be making recommendations to legislative bodies concerning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| that provide for the public's safety, health and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| An example I give them relating to the value of the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| is one of the earliest ordinances put in place by local government in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| This ordinance was enacted in Savannah, Georgia, more than two centuries ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| In 1759, 248 years ago to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| At the time, some home builders were building houses with wood chimneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| After a period of use, the wood in the chimneys caught fire and burned the house to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:39| Not only did one house burn to the ground, but whole blocks of houses would burn to the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| because of one chimney made of materials inadequate for that particular application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| After the wood chimney fires, Savannah's General Assembly decided for the safety, health and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| of the entire community to put in place an ordinance requiring permanent chimney materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| that could withstand fire and heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| And the ordinance went as far as to prohibit home builder construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| and even repair of wooden chimneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| This example I give my students about the value and importance of ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| applies perfectly here today with the proposed Knox County Stormwater Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| and the requirement of concrete pipe materials in three critical areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| As originally written, this ordinance allows for the property owner to use whatever material they choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| as long as there's no detrimental impact on the public's safety, health and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| As written, the section of the ordinance requiring reinforced concrete pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| and three critical and limited applications is logical, responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| and what is best for Knox County taxpayers and for quality growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4853)|
| 1:21:01| Mr. Parnell, your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| I'll conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| I'd like to give him another two or three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Give him another minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| I urge you to please use your vote responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| and pass the ordinance requiring concrete pipe in the three critical locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| as originally recommended by your professional staff, Director Weitrich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| and Stormwater Engineer Grandjean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you for the opportunity to comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| and I'll be glad to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| Do we have any questions for Mr. Parnell, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| For Chris, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| I hear you've said some things about galvanized pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| but you didn't mention PVC pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| In the city of Knoxville, have you had any problems with these modern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| for lack of a better word, plastic pipes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| Roadways in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| I'm not aware of any that were installed while I was director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| We did install some flexible pipes as demonstrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| in some of the side yards within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| and I'd say they're evaluating those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| Most recently, I was in Nashville at a location near the Titan Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:24| and I saw some of the plastic pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| So I thought, well, I'll just go over and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| I don't know if it had been beat up by the mower at the end or it was cut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| I mean, I've seen concrete pipes that were crumbling at the edges, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| where they were put in, and some municipalities, I think we received a letter on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| some municipalities have went to, you know, PVC pipe only, no concrete, no galvanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| I'm not aware that any municipalities have required only PVC pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| but the pipe that I did see and I looked in, it was like my granddad said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| he described like bowed like a cat's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| That's the way this pipe was installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| So it didn't look like it was a good installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| On this PVC pipe, we keep hearing about standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| Are they a standard like tensile strength or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| How is it that they compete with concrete pipe based on strength and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| Are they a national standard, a board standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| There are all kinds of material standards for pipes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| and I'm sure that if you had you could get some long lengths of on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| you could get some long lengths out of pipe depending on the gauge of the metal pipe and the plastic pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:54| But my experience, you know, you can look at a lot of things on paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| and do a lot of theoretical tests, but, you know, my neighborhood is like a real live laboratory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| I can go down there and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| I've seen the metal pipe fail two times since I've been living in the subdivision in 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:16| So rather than take a chance on putting a pipe under a roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| my experience is it's going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| I'd rather go with a sure thing where I've never seen a failure occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| and that's what I'm recommending to this commission is to go with a sure thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| Is your experience then solely due to the material or does it have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| or the installation of it play a part in any of the ones that you have personal knowledge of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| Well, the metal pipe has been the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| It's just rusted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| It's been my observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| The PVC pipe, I did not have experience with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| That's a new material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| It's been promoted in recent years on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Sam, you said you'd never heard of a concrete pipe failure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| In my 16 years as director of city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| I never observed a concrete pipe failure in the city of Knoxville under a roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| that we had to recommend replacing the concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| I never wrote a work order to the service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| never went to city council to recommend to them a capital project to replace a concrete pipe under a roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| Somebody sent me, and I'm sorry I don't have it, a couple of months ago on my fax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| an instance of ten miles of concrete pipe failure either outside of Atlanta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| or somewhere that cost like $46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| And I only say that to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| None of these products are perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| And you can have failures with any of them, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| And as Bruce has pointed out, I think the installation is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| You know, I've handed you the pictures, and the pictures can, you know, tell a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| Two times in my neighborhood in 45 years a metal pipe has been replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| And you can look at the picture that I took a month or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| a pipe that's been in place for three years, a metal pipe, and it's already rusting out on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Commissioner Smith, you had a question for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| Chris, could you come to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Mr. Parnell, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| And while he's coming to the microphone, Chairman Moore, you might remember out there in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| Joyce Tapscott with her subdivision, a four- or five-foot concrete pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| she had to redo every bit of that just in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| It took her several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Chris, the question and concern that a lot of people have is the public right-of-way area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| And that's what we need to sort of be safeguarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| In your opinion, with what you're all doing, and I'm looking through here and I can't find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| is in public right-of-way, was that corrugated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Because what Sam brought, when Sam brought the picture of this corrugated, it's just going to rust, pure and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| In public right-of-way, are you going to use concrete and or the plastic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| I'd hate to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| I don't feel comfortable putting corrugated in public right-of-ways because it's going to rust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| Well, the ordinance, as we've recommended it, actually calls for concrete under all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| In the public right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| We have another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| I think it's Bill Kimme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:58| If you'll give your name and address for the record, it's 308.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| My name is Bill Kimme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| I live at 617.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Watauga Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| I'm just here as a citizen and I'm not an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| I've just tried to learn as much about this as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| I'd like to represent the majority of Knox County taxpayers by coming here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| and asking County Commission to pass the stormwater ordinance 0707103 in its present form or stronger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:30| as dressed by impartial professional engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| This ordinance would meet the requirements already in place by the City of Knoxville to protect us from stormwater damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| The initial expense of using appropriate materials in future development should be paid for by those who install it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| not by the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Anything short of meeting the requirements of this ordinance may very well result in premature failure of infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| which must then be paid for by taxpayers to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| Besides the fiscal burden, failure can result in negative impacts on public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| and safety, property values, water quality, and our local environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| There are some misunderstandings regarding the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| First, concrete pipe will actually be required in approximately only 20 to 30 percent of most development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:25| Secondly, although concrete pipe is more expensive than high-density polyethylene or corrugated metal pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| it is cheaper when installed correctly than the other types of pipe, so the final cost of all pipe systems is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:41| An added benefit is that when concrete pipe is installed in required areas, it strengthens the roadbed above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:49| Commissioner Lambert has proposed amendments that may weaken this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| This may result in opening up land otherwise restricted for development due to sinkhole concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| flooding tendencies, and weakened requirements regarding erosion and sediment plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| I ask County Commission to disregard any amendments to weaken this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| and vote on it in its present form or stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| Anything less will send a clear message to Knox County residents that a small group of special interests matter more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| than the constituency that you are charged with protecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:45| My name is John Valiant, 800 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| I represent the Knoxville Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| And we've introduced some amendments, and I have here today with me Bob Campbell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| who is a professional engineer who you guys have heard on many occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| and he is a recently elected president of the Statewide Professional Engineers Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| We also have Marty Mason, Tom Fox, with the pipe industry, who can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:21| Rather than give a pre-prepared speech, I think it would be better if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:28| after you guys heard everything you're going to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| if you would ask some of these experts and people who you've heard before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| and maybe have come to rely on as being reliable people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| Ask Mr. Campbell his position on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| With regard to the amendments that Mr. Weitrick has introduced today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| actually we don't have any objection, I guess if you have them in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5514)|
| 1:32:04| We don't have any problem with the ones numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, 7, and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:13| The ones we do have problems with are the ones numbered 5 and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:22| There are good and valid reasons for each of the amendments that we are supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:31| A lot of times they will have adverse impacts on not only the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:40| but on some individual homeowners, and I think that you ought to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| If you have any questions, we're here to answer them and not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| I think you've all had public hearing after public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| You've heard everybody's been talking to you at one time or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| We've just got a bunch of people here that we feel are experts in the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| that will be willing to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| This is John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Commissioner Lambert has introduced an amendment sheet here that has several things on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:28| Some of it pertains to the pipe issue, what type of pipe it should be, concrete or other materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| But there's a lot of other things, some addressing the sink holes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| So he has many things in his total amendment type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| So far, discussion has pretty much hinged on the type of pipe, which is part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Do you have any comments or are we going to have anything on the other parts other than the pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| type of pipe that you would want to address of what he is proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| I could briefly give you a rundown on what our amendments speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:17| If you have our amendments in front of you, amendment number two speaks to the covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| It's on page four of the ordinance that we got, which was the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:32| We understood to be the latest ordinance that was prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| Where are yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| They've been introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| He's referring to Commissioner Lambert's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| If you look at number two of Commissioner Lambert's amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:57| that says covenants for permanent maintenance of stormwater facilities and best management practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5697)|
| 1:35:05| It's in the definitional section on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| If you read that, what it does is it says that a legal document executed by the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:20| or a homeowner's association is on a record and recorded with the Knox County Register of Deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| which guarantees perpetual and proper maintenance of stormwater facilities and best management practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:35| All we've simply done there is add the words outside public rights of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:43| And the reason we did that is if a homeowner such as yourself had a failure of a pipe in your front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:53| a major pipe, a covenant such as that would require you as a homeowner to repair it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5753)|
| 1:36:02| which we believe would probably bankrupt or financially disadvantage most of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| This is not a homebuilder's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| This is a homeowner's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| With regard to amendment three, floodplain, like I said, I think Mr. Weitrick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| or the Department of Public Works has addressed that, amendment three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| and we're happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| That was addressed in their amendment number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| With regard to the sinkholes, I think you'd be better served if Mr. Campbell discussed those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:42| But with the two definitional sections on page eight, as well as section 5.8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5802)|
| 1:36:51| if you combine the two of them, what that in essence does is it takes a sinkhole that may be 10 or 20 feet across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5811)|
| 1:37:00| and turns that into an unbuildable area of maybe an unlimited size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:05| It could be 200 feet, 400 feet, or it could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| And so what that would do is make unbuildable many areas in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| But I'd like Mr. Campbell to reference that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| Could you go through, you know, before you get into it, I'd like to address all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:25| One of what's being proposed gives special attention to some areas that are particularly flood-prone, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:34| I haven't lived in one of those areas and have seen it through the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| and basically started with that 30-some years ago of being concerned about that action and lived very near that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:46| And when I was commissioner before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| waiting across Dutchtown Road three-and-a-half feet of water to get the people who were flooded for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| And what amounts to that area there is very prone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| And what amounts to your recommendation through Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| is basically strikes all that out of that specific concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| And that raises a major question that we're not giving that area special concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| because if that area fails, Dutchtown Road, Cedar Bluff Road will be a lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| And there's not enough money in Knox County to resolve that kind of issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| I think it deserves special attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Obviously, in the repair of Dutchtown Road, we're spending a lot of money to address that issue because the county knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| And you're now removing some of those provisions in here as I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| And I don't think that ought to be related to type of pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| That's related to clearly the sinkhole regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| So I find that very troubling to remove those things that we have identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| And there are several throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| And we're just doing away with that special reference to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| So I would hate to see that really removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| Commissioner Leuthold, if I may, I'm Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| The reason for the removal of the part of that is not to weaken the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| The reason for that is somebody like me gets to design around what this ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| The way that it's currently worded, there are about three different interpretations of how you design that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:31| In talking to the county, they have studied that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| And part of that recommendation is in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| However, again, the way that it's worded, you could read that to say a four-day duration storm times 7.8 inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| which is 32 inches of rain you have to incorporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| You could read it to say a four-day storm, which is 6.24 times four days, which is 24 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:58| You could read it to say there has to be a subsurgent study, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| a study done on every sinkhole to see if one's coming up and one's going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| We would prefer the language to say exactly what they've done from their study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| but to reference areas that have been studied that have proven to have some documented evidence of a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| And have those as part of the ordinance that says, if you're in those areas, use these particular criteria in your design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| not some blanket statement that could incorporate every little sinkhole that's in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:38| And it could be one that's we want to call everything a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| I've been in pasture fields before where you're riding across and there's a dip of two feet that's about this big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| and all of a sudden it's a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Geotechnical reports will prove that that's not always the case, but that's what we end up calling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| If an area like yours has that kind of problem, let's put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| But, again, the way that it's worded, you can take this three or four different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| So what ends up happening is I come in and design that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| and I may not even alleviate your problem because I'm doing it on some other basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| We need to get to exactly the core reason that that's done and incorporate that into the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| not to get rid of it, but the way it was written was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| Well, have you worked with the highway, with Chris there and Bruce to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| We've talked about it, but it kind of just today was part of the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| was one of the days that we were able just to sit down and say, what's this and what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| And I don't ---- I hope I'm not speaking out of turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| but I think there is some agreement that we need to rewrite this section to have some specific things spelled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| on how we treat those areas that are troublesome because nobody wants to reintroduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| or exacerbate a problem that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| But we want to know when we go to design, what are we using as our design criteria to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Not a confusing piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| And that was our concern with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:15| Mr. Chairman, let me point out one thing so that you don't get a false impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| We've been working with this ordinance for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| And quite candidly, we've met with the Home Builders Association at least two times to which I was present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| Until you all saw those recommendations that came from Commissioner Lambert, that was the first time we also had seen those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| So these were kind of brought up to us at the ninth hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| Otherwise, we would have more clearly have addressed them by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| But we got them at the last minute also, even though we've had several meetings and several public forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:52| and we got these kind of at the ninth hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| So that's why if we seem a little ill-prepared to address some of these issues, it's because we didn't get them until late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6174)|
| 1:43:03| Hey, Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| I just want to remind everybody that this is an ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| We are going to have to come back and re-vote on this next month for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| I would like to go ahead and vote on what we have on the table right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| and give our engineering department a chance to thoroughly go through Commissioner Lambert's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:32| and Norman's and Commissioner Harmon's as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| and see if we can't, by next month, have a better consensus of some of these more detailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| and things that we need to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:52| They're very detailed, and hopefully by next month we can have this figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| But we do need to go ahead and pass this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| That's why I made the motion today, so that we could go ahead and have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| so that next month we could go ahead and pass what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| I have a friendly amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| We've been talking about my amendment nine from day one about the pipe issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:24| I believe that we should pass that today with my pipe amendments intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:33| We've been talking about that from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| Now, I understand some of this other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| I may have brought it to the table late in the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| but from the very first public meeting I've been talking about the pipe issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| and I think that today we need to pass it with the provision that allows us to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| these more modern high-tech materials for the drain pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| Commissioner Lambert, if you'd like to have that as a separate vote, as an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| that would be your prerogative, but I don't wish to add that to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| I would like to speak to the question that Commissioner Luttrell just raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| Ordinances have to be passed on two readings, and they can't differ that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:20| I mean, if we were to start making significant changes from first reading to second reading, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| We're really back on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| So I think we have to resolve some of these matters today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| much as we might want to just pass the first template and then add stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| Adding too much stuff makes it a different resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| and makes it not a first-second reading situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Mr. Law Director, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| Well, what you're looking for is a substantial deviation from what was passed in the first instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:53| and it becomes a matter of opinion what would be substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| And I think I would agree with Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| I think certainly today we ought to at least settle this pipe issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| and I think there's several other parts of this that we could probably go ahead and agree on or possibly pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| So I'd like to see that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| I think we've got a motion on the floor to pass it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Well, I've got a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| I'm open to allowing Commissioner Lambert to have his amendment to it and vote on that separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| He can make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| I've made the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| If I get a second that we pass it with my amendment nine intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Second by Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| There are three, A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| It's only C that deals directly with pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| So when you say and you've got D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| So you've got, you're changing, you've got A, B, and C now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:19| C of what's proposed is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| You now have A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| I don't know what you're doing with D because you say that's entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| So D, I guess, would be left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| So your amendment is to substitute the entire amendment nine for 4.5.5, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| That wouldn't be a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| That would be an amendment to the vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| Yeah, but I've made the substitute motion that we pass it with this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:59| He's substituting a motion for Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| I want to make sure I understand what I'm voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| These amendments that the engineering and public works, this is a part of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| It would be a part of the motion except for where Commissioner Lambert, where he's adding the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| allowing the more flexibility in the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| That's the only difference between your motion and my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| So these would go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| I guess someone said they were against number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| which is the minimum penalty for fines associated with land development activities shall be $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| It was five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Five would be in direct conflict with what the motion and the amendment to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:53| That's part of the difference between the two motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| instead of number five that we would have Commissioner Lambert's forest pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| And with regard to number six, we feel that the amendment, I mean the motion as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| without the, it says $50 to $5,000 fine at the discretion of the director of public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6549)|
| 1:49:18| What this number six does is it raises the minimum penalty to $1,000 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:27| We think a wider span would probably be more fair depending on what the violation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| If every small violation drew a minimum penalty of $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| that might be sort of an onerous burden on at least the smaller people and would drive them out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| But what we're voting on would be the minimum penalty of $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| That would be part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| I'll make that a part of my motion to lower the minimum fine to $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:59| back to what the original ordinance said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| A quick question for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Did the second agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| Commissioner Pinkston, would you agree to lowering the fine $1,000 to $50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| He does agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Chris, you and Bruce, you guys said that you all just saw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| Are you guys in agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| I am not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| So are you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| I guess what I was trying to point out is that when Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| when this was brought to us, I guess at intergovernmental or I think it was intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| that was the first opportunity we had to look at any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| and actually talk to them and explain at least our rationale as to why we were recommending what we were recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| Because I actually literally got a phone call today for explanations on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| And, quite frankly, I think Commissioner Luthold's idea is an excellent idea to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| because I think several of these things, once they talk to us, first off, some of them are non-negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| The EPA reference, you've got to have it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| It's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| The $1,000 fine, quite frankly, I don't want to be sending my people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| We're not in the habit of going out there and harassing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| But if I have someone in violation, $50 isn't going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| They're not going to care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| They're going to continue on doing whatever they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| $1,000 would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| And that's what we need, something to get somebody's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| So some of these things, like I say, I think we can work out and have it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| But some of them, quite frankly, they don't need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| So you make a recommendation that we just pass as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| and then you all tweak it and come back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| And Commissioner Harmon's concern, I don't think we're looking at major changes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| I think we're looking at maybe changing the wording so that the intent is clearly spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| And in some cases, like I said, once they hear our explanation, they may decide that it's a non-issue also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| I appreciate everybody working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| You know, Commissioner Lambert, people have done a lot of work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| You all have done good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Back to the enforcement, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| That $50 minimum, it allows you to set the fine, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| You can go 50 to 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| You could do whatever you wanted to at that point, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| So long as we're not limiting us to the ability to fine more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| I wasn't sure how you all were wording that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| I have no problem making it a sliding scale, but I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| The upper limit still needs to be up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| You know, our job is to try to protect the environment and at the same time protect the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| and at the same time try to allow for reasonable quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| I'm going to support Commissioner Lambert's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| I think the pipe is a major part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| I think money is a major part, and Bruce just said that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| And any other things that we come back with, Mr. Law Director, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| seem to me would be considered minor changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| I think if we try to change the pipe thing next month, it could be considered, as Commissioner Harmon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:11| a substantial deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| I want to bring up to date for those in the audience, TV and personally, an understanding of where we are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| What is before us is a resolution that would pass the stormwater ordinance as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| except what we're going to do is change the pipe obligation to plastic or corrugated metal or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:40| I think we have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| The problem is the unstated elephant in the room is the urban growth agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| We promised to create a stormwater ordinance as strict as the city's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:54| and the city requires reinforced concrete pipe in six situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| We've got an ordinance that says we've got to do it in the minimum of these three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| and now we're going to go down to zero, and you think we're going to be in accordance with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| We're going to get sued, and EPA is going to come in here, and we're going to have government buy lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| We cannot pass this in this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| In effect, Commissioner Norman and I both wrote up two amendments to strengthen this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| I wrote one where the provisions were parallel to the city and what the city requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| Commissioner Norman wrote one that improves the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| Those are being ignored, and the only provision we're adding is one that weakens it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| and almost guarantees the EPA or the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| This has got to go down in flames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| And, guys, this is a reasonable obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| Other communities are living with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| The city of Knoxville is living with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| We don't have to give developers everything they want, every time they want it, every instance they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| Let's vote this one down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Let me address this urban growth agreement business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| Luckily, Commissioner Frank Lutho is back on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| He authored the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| He was the chief negotiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| No other county commissioners were involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| I learned more from talking to him at five minutes at lunch today in a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| than I've learned since I've been doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| The urban growth agreement was put in place in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| At that time, the prevailing ordinance in the city of Knoxville was written in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| Now, if anybody here wants us to pass an ordinance as strict as the 1997 city ordinance, you're out of your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:43| It was very, very weak at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| The city has substantially increased the requirements of that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:52| So, Commissioner Lutho, I mean, if you're sitting there in 2001 and you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| we're going to pass an ordinance as strict as the city's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| how in the world could anybody be thinking, well, we don't know what they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| but we're going to continue to make it as strict as whatever the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| And I think Commissioner Lutho will uphold that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| So the urban growth agreement was a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| But it could not foresee what might be coming in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Law Director, are we looking at the EPA coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| Are we looking at lawsuits with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| How will this play in the courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| I don't have a crystal ball, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Are you strictly talking about the urban growth agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| He said that we need one as strict as the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| Is it your opinion that if we do not pass one as strict as the city's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| that we will be brought into court by the city or by the EPA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| I haven't talked with the city about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| You know, they have given us an extension on meeting this requirement that we've agreed to in the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7011)|
| 1:57:00| I do not know if the city plans on filing a lawsuit or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| if we don't pass an ordinance that looks just like theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| Are you of the opinion that this ordinance is a proper ordinance for us to pass with the amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| You're asking me whether. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| I mean, there are a number of legal arguments, I believe, that can be made in defense of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:28| That's, you know, is it as strict as, and that gets into the legal arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| I mean, if you want me to express those, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| It's one of those things that the attorney typically doesn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| You know, we can. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| I'll be glad to provide you with more information on it if that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| But, you know, what Mr. Cate just said is part of the reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7070)|
| 1:57:58| holding Knox County to a standard that's passed today instead of what was passed in 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| I mean, that's part of the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| That's part of the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| It looks to me like Mr. Weitrick and his staff, they've studied the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| They've had a number of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| And there has. . .they've received professional advice as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| And, you know, from a legal perspective, I would feel comfortable in defending their position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:32| if that helps answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| And I'd just like to remind my fellow commissioners, as Mark said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:47| and as Bruce Weitrick said and Chris Grimeshoe said, it's these statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:55| They are recommending concrete pipe in these situations, these three situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7135)|
| 1:59:03| They are recommending this increased fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| They're the ones that know how this ordinance is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| That's their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I hope we will follow their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Where's Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| I believe I heard you say that the amendments that Commissioner Lambert put on regarding pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| that you were okay with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Generally speaking, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| We've got a gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| If you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| Thank you, Chairman Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| I appreciate you recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| I'm Al Hogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| I'm a rec professional engineer in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| I work for the American Concrete Pipe Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| I'm the regional engineer for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| And I do appreciate your consideration of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| I know you guys have thought long and hard about this, and it's been discussed for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| I have followed this with great interest, obviously, because I am involved in the concrete pipe industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:10| I know you've had several speakers this morning talk on the matter, some technical, some not so technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| some from a common sense perspective, and I would like to stay mostly in that vein myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| You have several products in front of you that you're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| Obviously, we think, from our perspective, reinforced concrete pipe is a proven product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| It's been around for hundreds of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| In fact, the organization I work for has been representing that industry for just over 100 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| We've had some good discussion about the issues with corrugated metal pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| I think that is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| Everybody has seen that play out over the last few years with all the replacements that you've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| and you've heard discussion on all those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| We hadn't had a whole lot of discussion about the HDPE pipe product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| There has been some comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| I think the only question this morning is exactly what size it serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| but I would like to do a little bit of compare and contrast to our product versus HDPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| There was also a question about installation and the importance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| I think that's where the biggest difference is, the installation, the structural component of both the products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| Structurally speaking, reinforced concrete pipe, you see it going down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| Not only does the truck carry it, but before that product leaves the yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| one thing I want you to understand, a 60-inch reinforced concrete pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| about as big inside diameter as I am tall, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| that product is tested before it leaves the yard structurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| In fact, it is tested to make sure that it will carry an 18-wheeler all by itself sitting on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| We test it with an apparatus, but that's the weight we put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| About 80,000 pounds is the actual pressure that that product withstands prior to leaving our yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| Now, contrast that with the HDPE pipe product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| The larger that product gets, the easier it is to deflect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| i.e., obviously, the more attention you've got to take to installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| And I think that's been somewhat recognized here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| But please understand, the entire structural component of that product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| is the bedding and backfill you place around that product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| Talk a little bit about cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| If that product is installed properly, a long reinforced concrete pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| there's very little difference in price, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| I would ask you to look at that from a common sense standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| Think about the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Use a product that has been proven over 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| We think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| Surely, from a common sense standpoint, you would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| The other product, you've even asked a question to your city, who used to be your city engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| Mr. Parnell was up a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| And, you know, he even made the comment that that was a fairly new product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| Now, it's been around for a few years, but it is still new compared to the other products on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7376)|
| 2:03:04| I would caution you to at least take that into account and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| Please remember there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| We think we make a proven product that will serve your needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| and your citizens' needs for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| This is an opportunity for all of you to protect the health, safety, and welfare of your citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| I appreciate the time to talk, Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| Mr. Batty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| Mr. Chairman, Marty Mason would like to respond to that briefly, very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| My name is Marty Mason, and I live at 523 North Bertrand Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| To give a response to this, I know this has been a complicated issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| and we've talked about this time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| and everybody seems to come up here and contradict themselves when they talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| I mean, I think what we're trying to do and what Commissioner Lambert is actually doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| is actually we're letting the market dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| If concrete pipe is a pipe that is just as equal as price-wise is properly installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| then the market will dictate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| We're not excluding concrete in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| We're allowing it in all three of those instances that has been portrayed in front of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| And what we're trying to say is use the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| and you're going to say things that have been on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| Well, we have studies, the dreaded, quote, unquote, corrugated metal pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| We have studies of pipe that has been in the ground for 50 years all across the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:36| that they have done testing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| I mean, the testing is there on every different material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| No material is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| Every material is going to have a weakness at certain points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| It all depends on what water is going through it, what soil is going around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| and that will dictate what is the right product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| There are places where corrugated metal pipe is not the right product in that specific instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| That maybe concrete is the right product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| Maybe HTPE is the right product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| But you're allowing your local professional engineers who have degrees at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| Tennessee Tech, all across the southeast, to make these decisions for their homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| or their owners and essentially the taxpayers of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| The proposal, the amendment that Mr. Lambert is putting forward is not excluding concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| It is including concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| It is including HTPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| It is including PVC and including corrugated metal pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| And another thing that you might want to think about is on every engineer's project that they put out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| there's stormwater, but there's also sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| Sanitary sewer pipe has been made at depths of 10 feet or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| It's PVC pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| It is PVC pipe that is going into the ground for sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| I just want to make sure that it's not concrete pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| That's a point that should be made that would go across there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Quick question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| From my days at UT, and I forget to answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| you've got fresh concrete just being cured and put into a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| And you've got PVC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Which will the aquatic life take to quicker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| Which one does concrete leach out, anything, or PVC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| Which one from the aquatic standpoint is better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| From an aquatic standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| I don't have that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| I don't know that in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| I think it was, from my understanding, that the plastic would because the concrete would leach out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| I may be wrong, but I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| How about leaching out chemicals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:53| Just so that I'll understand, because you've said that you're fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| you think that the different pipes could work adequately well or you could support them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:04| but your recommendation to us today is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| Our recommendation is that concrete, essentially, condensing it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| is that concrete pipe be installed in county road right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| And that is based on a study that was done by Arcadis slash Tetra Tech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| When they did the comparison of the two ordinances, their first comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| their draft version said the pipe was not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| Their final version said pipe was an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| and that the county should adopt a concrete pipe standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:36| I have a question for you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| You were saying that you support the concrete pipe only based on the Arcadis recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| Had we had the original report from our consultants that actually said the city needed to show some leniency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:57| when it came to materials, would you have supported the original recommendation as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| And that was their original recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| That was the recommendation that Arcadis made before they took it to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| and the city demanded that it be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| And so I think that their original recommendation is a more pure recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:23| It's their real opinion before their opinion was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| And I think that that's the recommendation we need to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| and allow the folks within the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| and allow the engineers in the industry to make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| and not limit their options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| Their original recommendation was, their draft recommendation was that pipe was not an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| and that the city should revisit their pipe standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| And I assume by that they meant to include plastic pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| Why that recommendation was changed, that I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| Thank you, Commissioner Nolman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| I just want to make sure everyone understands what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| Commissioner Lambert, I think what you're saying is you want to substitute the language that you had in your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:13| Yes, I want to substitute their number five for my amendment number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:19| And then I want to change the wording in their amendment six to be 50 to $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:27| instead of locking it at $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Commissioner Pinkston, do you go along with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| He does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| So the vote is on the original motion plus the two items identified by Commissioner Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| the lowering of the fines and the use of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| No, not the lowering of the fines, the allowing flexibility in the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:55| And allowing flexibility in the type of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| Well, I think it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| All of them have lower components, but I know you don't want to call it that, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| So what we'll be voting on is the amendment, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| And if it passes, then we still go back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:13| This is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| I don't think that's how Mr. Lambert did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| I asked him to do it that way, but that's not how he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| He did a substitute motion, which basically was my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| which was the original ordinance with the amendments that Bruce Weitrick had brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:31| But he's changed number five and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| That's the difference between his motion and my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| At least that's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| So it doesn't make much difference how we vote and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| So if his were to pass, then the pipe would be up to the Bruce Weitrick's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:55| and the fines would be up to his as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| If it does not pass, then we'll come back to mine the way it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| I think we come back to yours anyway, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Back to his anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| Well, that's not the way I took his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| I think he did a substitute motion, not an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| Substitute motion is a form of a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| What he is doing, and in order to keep this clean, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| he is trying to amend basically to change out certain provisions with his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7876)|
| 2:11:25| That should be voted on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Once those changes are made, you come back to the original motion and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| Well, that was the way I was hoping he would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| That's not the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| I'll do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| However we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=7898)|

| 2:21:57| Not only was he known in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| he was known throughout the entire county and is doing good works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| and deserves that recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8547)|
| 2:22:28| The clerk is changing the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| The time is 4.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| I'm going to try to suggest something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| I would suggest that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| and let the delegations to be heard in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| And then as soon as that is over, we go into our zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| and then come back to the rest of the agenda, if we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| if the commission wishes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| Mr. Chairman, if I might ask, I have an item on the agenda for farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8574)|
| 2:23:00| Mr. Neal Denton is here, and he wanted to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| if perhaps we could do that after public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| I don't think it will take long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| but I'd like for him to be able to do that rather than wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| It was added to the agenda right before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| We've had a commissioner want to take just a brief recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| so we'll take about a five-minute recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| and then we'll do public forum and then do Commissioner Hammond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8606)|
| 2:23:37| Well, we're starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:52| That would not be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| Mr. Edwards, we've got a couple of things to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| so I'll call you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| First, Commissioner Mike Hammond wanted us to do Resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:12| Clerk, if you'll read that one into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| It was the one that was to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| redirecting the approved matching mentors consortium grant of $10,000 to Farmers Co-op| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| for emergency hay transportation costs as a matching grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| Mr. Neal Denton is here, if you would come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| Having grown up on a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| and reading the stories of the plight of our farmers here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| my heart really goes out to them because of the drought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| and we know how important the livestock is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| And so in talking with Mr. Denton, with the Agricultural Extension Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| members of the Farm Bureau and the Farmers Co-op,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| they have put up $10,000 to help pay for transportation costs to bring hay into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8694)|
| 2:25:01| This hay will go to the neediest farmers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| And he asked if we would consider a matching grant of $10,000 to help pay for these transportation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:11| And so I was very happy to put this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| Mr. Denton, if you would take just a moment to explain how this would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| because I know that the accountability of this money is very important to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| And would you tell us how this would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| Yes, thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| Basically, we're dealing with lots of farmers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| Almost everybody is looking at a 50% cut in hay, and some farmers did not harvest any at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| So after some discussions with Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| and some other commissioners, Commissioner Pinkston, Commissioner Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| we went to Farm Bureau and they agreed, Farm Bureau of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:49| agreed to put up $10,000 to pay for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| And Commissioner Hammond and I spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| and he said he thought it would be a good idea to put up another $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| What that will allow us to do is pay transportation costs for about 10,000 bales of square bale hay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:09| to be brought in to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| It will be handled through the Farmers Cooperative here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| We are going to set together a committee of five people, one from Farm Services Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:25| one from the Soil Conservation District, one from Farm Bureau, one from Co-op,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:32| and one from UT Extension, and have applications for this hay taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| so that we can be sure that the neediest folks do get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| The money will be handled through the Farmers Co-op.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| They will just pay the transportation, and the farmers cost will then be the cost of the hay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| and some handling expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| And Jerry Price is here with me as well from the Farm Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| and also from Knox County Farmers Co-op.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| He's on both boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| So, Mr. Chairman, I will make a motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| Seconded by Commissioner Craig Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| Ten thousand bales is how many truckloads, Doug, approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| No, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| It would be about ten truckloads, ten transfer truckloads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8842)|
| 2:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8847)|

| 2:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| We're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| I think the first one up, Mr. David Draper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8859)|
| 2:28:00| Can you hear my name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| Yes, Mr. Draper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| David Draper, 620 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Ms. Kaywood wanted to inquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| I spoke to each of your separate committees a week ago today with regard to the recycling facility out in Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8888)|
| 2:28:17| I reported to you a week ago that we were making progress relative to expert analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| on some odor complaints that we've had out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| We've been running a fine-tooth comb over the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| We've been into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| We have convened a community advisory board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| We have met with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| And we continue to make both operational improvements and community improvements with our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:47| So I can report to you that this operator, this contractor of this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:54| is moving forward on all fronts with regard to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8934)|
| 2:28:59| And we are selling, at this point, 14 products in this community, recycled products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| And I'd be glad to answer any questions that any of you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| I believe several of you have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| We'd like for more of you to come and see the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| It's a big operation, and we'd welcome any visits to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| I'd also like to ask Mike Cohen to speak with you just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| His firm has been working with Natural Resources, the operator, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8967)|
| 2:29:32| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| Mike Cohen, 5208 Yosemite Trail, in the heart of the Third Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8973)|
| 2:29:38| I've worked with Natural Resources Recovery in setting up a citizen's advisory board to work with the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:45| and advise it on issues to institutionalize two-way communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| The board includes a representative from the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| an agricultural extension agent, Commissioner Kaywood sits on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| and a number of businesses that use the facility, a number of businesses that bring material to the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| and a number of businesses located and residents that live nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| And I can assure you they are not all residents that are happy about having that facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| In addition, we've got a consultant in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| and the consultant has talked to all of the neighbors that we could identify that have any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:21| We're really trying to increase communication between the facilities, the facility and its neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| And I would echo what Mr. Draper said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| which is we would love to have any of you out to a tour of the facility and see what's being done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9030)|
| 2:30:35| because we believe you'll come away impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| Next up we have Brian Mahon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| Mahon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| Money hun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| I'm kind of butchering it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| If you'll give your name and address for the record, and I apologize, and it's 420.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9054)|
| 2:31:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| My name is Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| I live at 5512 Dogwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| First, I must say that I enjoy watching commission on public access TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:15| and I just do have a little critical word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| I can't always hear your votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| I wish some of you would get a little closer to the microphone sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| And at this opportunity, I would also like to thank anyone who had a hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| or turned a spade of dirt over for the skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| That's going to be ‑‑ thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| That's going to be a wonderful opportunity for my grandchildren to ride Grandpa's skateboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| and maybe I won't get called to ground off a section of sidewalk someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| The real reason that I came here today never quite made it to the agenda in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| So you all are some very, very tough people to listen to all of our words without yawning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:06| so I will not take up one more second of your time on anything that is at this point a hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| I happen to know Mr. Moneyhun personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| and he is one of Knox County's members of the Society for Creative Inaccurism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:26| a medieval reenactment group that we have a chapter of locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9146)|
| 2:32:31| And I'm just curious, how well was Knox County represented at the Penzic Wars this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| Actually, we had about 20 people up there this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| and a few of them on the field fighting like maniacs, like a scene out of Braveheart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:47| You mean about like a county commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| Almost, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| Well, I appreciate that you represented us so well in the Penzic Wars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part1?start=9177)|
