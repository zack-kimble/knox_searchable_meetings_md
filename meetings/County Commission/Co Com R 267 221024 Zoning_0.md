| 0:06:02| wherever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| They have a tough job to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| and it's not always a welcome job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| to residents in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=367)|

| 0:08:18| that have been there for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| and all I'm interested in doing is changing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| from one acre per home to two homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=503)|

| 0:08:37| for any questions or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Ms. Nations, when was the second house built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| The second home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| I've been there for 21 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| and it was there when I moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Let me pull this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| I've got so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| It's actually a mobile home that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Yeah, I've got a feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| I asked Director Snowden to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| I've got a feeling this is one of those BZA moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| that was approved to have a medical hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| There's no such thing as a medical hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| So this house was already there when you bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| I think I bought it in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Yeah, that's what the records show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| That is why this gives me a chance to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| this is why BZA is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Here, odds are, and Director Snowden may agree or disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| odds are if we look back far enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| it was before 1985, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| before COGE was even there as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| But, you know, BZA needs to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| that if they approve something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| it has to fit the codes in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| So I'm taking it that I'm pretty sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| that that house was there before you bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| and you're just trying to clean up a mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| that started somewhere on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| So I am going to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=610)|

| 0:12:47| Planning Commission action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| was to approve the Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| to MDR medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| because it is consistent with the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| for MDR and development trends in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| by a vote of 12-0, consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| Do you wish to speak to your project, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| I would like to do a mobile home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| a family mobile home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| because now I can do only two mobile homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| so I got basically four kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| and then I would like to at least do five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| And that's the reason I'm doing RV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| and I mean, that's my plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Is there any discussion or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| from Commission or the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=823)|

| 0:13:49| Like a family mobile home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Oh, I got it. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| A family mobile home park, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| I want to put more than two mobile home parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| I mean, two mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Right now I only can do two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| so I want to be able to do at least five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| Are there any mobile homes on there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Yes, there's one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| So you've got just shy of seven acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| And you want to put a total of, did you say five mobile homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| Yeah, at least for, I mean, I'm planning to put five, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| Okay, well, why would planning want medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| if you're only using five dwelling units on seven acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| Okay, I'm planning to lot the front like at least acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=895)|
| 0:15:03| one acre or probably two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I'm planning to put like at least five mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=906)|
| 0:15:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| I think I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| You've got almost seven acres, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Okay, and on those seven acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| how many structures do you want to place there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=927)|
| 0:15:36| Like I said, at least five, but I want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| now everything is going to be, if it's going to be RV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| so I'm going to divide the one acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| and build five mobile homes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| So you want to subdivide each acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| and put five mobile homes in one acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| Is that what you're trying to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| I'm not quite following this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| No, this is one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| The rest is going to be on the filter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| I might do another mobile home, but I'm not sure yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| Sir, on the total seven acres that you have altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| how many mobile homes do you want to put on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| For now, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Five on the whole seven acres, you just want five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Yeah, for now, five, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| Commissioner Beeler, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Director Welch, are you able to speak at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| to why MDR was needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| or was it simply a request of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Excuse me, it was a request of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| and there's a considerable amount of MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| already adjacent to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| and basically three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| It's very consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| and the area that was developed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| so as far as the number of units or the uses on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| the consistency was what the commissioners thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| was appropriate to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Yeah, I notice there's clearly a mobile home park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| There's another one behind this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| The property across the street from this is MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| The five mobile homes that you're wanting to place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| are you wanting to put them on one acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| near the front of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Yeah, on the front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Okay, and you want the rest of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| to be available for something later, perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Yeah, this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Okay, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| You want more space around you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| and you want to put the five in a concentrated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Okay, makes sense now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Commissioner Daly, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Actually, he didn't even have to have a rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| to do what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Is that correct, Mr. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Yeah, I guess if he had that whole seven acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| he probably would not have had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| but with just five mobile homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| or six with his own personal one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| but that was the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| And at the time, I'm not sure we had this clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Was it seven units or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| Yeah, who told you that you needed the MDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Did anybody, or just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| I asked a couple questions on the county commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| and they say I have to do RV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| to put at least more than two mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1129)|

| 0:19:08| If anything, it should have been PR, not MDR, but PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| I would be hesitant to do the MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| unless you really want to build a mobile home park in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| So it's up to the seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Like I say, you don't need a rezoning for what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| but you say you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1173)|

| 0:19:40| Director Welch, if we zone this for MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| after he leaves the meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| he could sell that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| and they could put 70 mobile homes on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Approximately, with the density, with the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| yes, that is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| But he only wants six units at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| That is what the applicant is saying, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| I just think this leaves it wide open for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| He can do this with low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1216)|
| 0:20:27| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| You said there's MDR all over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| I'm pulling up the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| I guess the question is, is there any reason not to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| I mean, the applicant asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| There's MDR around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| I mean, it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Yeah, it opens it up, but that's what's everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| I mean, well, there's LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| I'm just kind of picking through it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| PR, LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Mr. Welch, just help me look through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| There's RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| There's some A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| He would not be able to do mobile homes on a planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| so MDR is most appropriate for the use that he wants to put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| for the mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| I mean, this aerial map shows mobile homes everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| so I'm not sure it's out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| I mean, I understand we're always at the risk of anybody zoning anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1305)|
| 0:21:53| that they could do anything down the road as long as it complies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| We deal with that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Sometimes people zone a commercial, and we say, well, you could put a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| you know, there's a zillion uses for that in a commercial neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| and whatever, but I think if the applicant has asked for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| and it's been approved by a planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| and it's consistent with what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| I would ask the other question is why wouldn't we do what the applicant wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| Is there a big hurdle to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| I don't see a big hurdle to go forth, but it's not my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| I mean, it is my district, but every district is my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| I would look to the district commissioner to sort of better understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| but I just can't see any reason why we wouldn't right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Commissioner Lee, would you be willing to yield to Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1363)|

| 0:22:45| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1365)|

| 0:22:48| Director Welch, just to expand the conversation a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| give a brief explanation of the types of housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| that you can put on PR versus RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| I think that might answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| It's my understanding that RB you have a little bit more leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| with the types of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Yes, with RB you would be able to have greater leeway in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Planned residential, houses and detached houses, not including mobile homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| duplexes, this is in PR, multi-dwelling structures, accessory use buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| some commercial uses as part of planning and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| recreation uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| So those are limited residential uses that would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| So that would be why possibly staff recommended RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| and also medium density if he wants, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| add five plus the existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| that would go beyond the low density residential of zero to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And, again, it was not compatible with the adjacent land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1430)|

| 0:23:58| I would make a motion to approve the sector plan to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1438)|

| 0:26:21| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1582)|

| 0:26:42| D-22-RZ is a request of Masana Investments, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| for rezoning from agricultural to planned residential up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| dwelling units per acre at 0 Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| parcel ID 143-112 in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Sir, will you please approach the podium and state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| Mr. Davis, you will have five minutes to address commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| and then I will give the opposition a total of five minutes to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| No, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| This property is located on Fox Road just east of Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| so basically it overlooks Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| just south of Kingston Pike in a pretty highly developed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| We originally asked for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| We agreed with MPC to negotiate that down to four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| There were several of the MPC commissioners at the meeting that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| willing to go to five, so we did not need the density of five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| and we were willing to step that down to four to do single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| residential on the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| You can't see the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| but we developed a subdivision on the other side of George Williams Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| back probably almost 18, 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| and I think it's zoned four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| and we want to do something similar to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Where this property is located with the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| with Pellissippi Parkway there, with access to a red light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| we feel that in that particular area four units an acre is not unwarranted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| and I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| Commissioner Lee, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Those of you who are here in opposition to this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| does anyone wish to address commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Sir, please approach the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| and you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| My name is Philip Royer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| I live at 322 Triplett Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| and Triplett Lane and the neighbors that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| basically the properties are above the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| and to the east of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| I think from a perspective of those of us on Triplett Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| the loss of the natural vegetation that would be due to heavy grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1773)|
| 0:29:42| that would be required on this property is our main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| Every time a tree goes down on George Williams Road or anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| the noise from Pellissippi gets louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| And I know that doesn't sound like a major concern perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| but it is something that we notice where we live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| and it's changed dramatically over the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| In setting the density for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| we feel like a density of three or below would be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| And the reason we feel that way is that out of this entire property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| probably I'm going to pick a number of maybe 50% to 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| is capable of being developed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| The rest of it is a 20% slope or greater up toward the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1837)|
| 0:30:46| It would take a mammoth grading effort to turn that into any kind of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| So in setting the density for the entire tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| what you're doing is saying that part of the tract is going to have a heavier density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| than what you stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| That's part of your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| Also, I would say that as a frequent user of Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| it was stated at planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| that this piece of property is served by an excellent collector road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| And it was also stated by one of the planning commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| that this road has a signal at Kingston Pike, which we all know is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| Narrow winding Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| if I were a resident that used Fox Road on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| I would be really concerned about more traffic on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| You've already approved hundreds of apartment homes on Emory Church Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| that use Fox Road as their access to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| I think Mr. Davis should have the right to develop his piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| and he should have the right to connect to Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| But I think that should be part of your deliberation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| about setting the density for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Mr. Davis, do you have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Again, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| You know, and I have spoken to the neighbors and the Gilmwaters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| who live back behind the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| And if we have to, if we're required by grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| to take down the vegetative buffer there, I've agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| and I'll tell you all publicly here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I've agreed to put up a vegetative buffer there with Leland Cypress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| or whatever they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| They're liking to help create a vegetative buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| to help diminish some of the exposure they would get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| So I've agreed to do that to help them with the buffer site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Commissioners, does anybody have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Commissioner Frazier, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Director Welch, tell me, staff recommended three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Can you tell me why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| When you look at the development, that's to the basically north and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| There's one to three dwelling units directly adjacent to the high north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| or west again, whatever direction it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| And approximately 1.3 dwelling units per acre further south on Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| I mean, there is higher density across Pellissippi Parkway, MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| but, again, it's across a major interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| But that is the primary reason for our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| And as they stated, this is a challenging piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| As they stated, there's 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Ten of those are only usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I know there's concern by the community of clustering those homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| and actually increasing the density there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Mr. Davis, you mentioned that you did reach out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| Did you have those discussions with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Were you able to answer any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Yes, Madam, to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| I mean, you know, obviously anytime there's development adjacent to your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| it creates concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| The property there, going back to the back, we did our road profiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| It's all 12% going up to the back end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| So our road profiles, at least what we drew up, do not exceed 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| And so, yes, Madam, I'd be glad to continue to work with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| like we try to do elsewhere to help them mitigate some of their questions and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| Now, will you be the builder on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| No, Madam, I'm not smart enough to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| I just do the development and I sell to builders, yes, Madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| So you don't know the vision for the property as far as housing types or amenities or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| Well, I can generally the price of the home dictates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| or is partially dictated by the price of the land and price of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| As you can imagine, the price of the property is not cheap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| and our development cost is not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| So the price of the homes will be pretty substantial, yes, Madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| And Director Welch, I know it was mentioned just a little bit about there was a reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| during the Planning Commission meeting about a light, a signal at Capitol Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| And I actually went out and kind of staged pulling in and out of Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| going through Capitol Drive, which is going through a business kind of complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| That seems a little tricky to include this as an adequate roadway for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| On the face of it, it's a little bit tricky, Commissioner Fraser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| but one who drives out there a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I mean, after a couple of times you want to take a left onto Kingston Pike from Fox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| you learn very quickly to go to the traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| And that traffic signal was purposely put in there probably 20 years ago to serve that exact purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| both commercial development as well as traffic on Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| I can say I sat there for a good 20, 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| and I saw very few cars who were using that avenue to go through Capitol Drive at the signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| Would a signal be indicated possibly there at Fox and Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| Those two traffic signals would be too close together to offer any type of relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| It would really cause concerns on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Director Welch, will you please read us the Planning Commission's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| Planning Commission recommendation was approve the planned residential zone up to four dwelling units per acre by a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Director Welch, did planning staff do a slope analysis on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| I can't find it in my documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Commissioner, if they did, it's not included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| The notes indicate that number three on the proposed amendment indicates that the recommended density is more in account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2213)|
| 0:37:04| with the slope analysis of the property, which is success, disturbing no more than 11 acres within the HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I do not have the slope analysis in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| So is half the acreage developable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| Within the hillside protection area, it is recommended approximately 11 acres of that be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2243)|
| 0:37:33| So 90 homes on 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Well, that's acreage that's in the HP area also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| I mean, then you have to go with that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Acreage that is outside of that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Again, I do not have those numbers in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| Well, I live off of Fox Road, so I'm numerous times a day driving Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| And as Mr. Snowden could probably testify, it is not one of our most upgraded roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2277)|
| 0:38:08| And with the different curves involved in it, plus we have the benefit of some of the car dealerships on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| using Fox Road as a test track for their luxury vehicles, which makes it exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| So they can get off Kingston Pike, do the nice curves down to Emory Church Road, go along the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| get back on to Pellissippi, head to North Shore, make a U-turn, and then come on back up to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| So there's much more traffic on there than just normal home traffic from the residents in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2315)|
| 0:38:44| But I do agree with the comments that everybody submitted in the packet from the public that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| everything in that area is three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| You've got Fox Creek, Fox Landing, all of those in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| There's nothing higher than two and a half to three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you, Commissioner Schoenmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Is there any more discussion, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Seeing none, I'll look to the district commissioner, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| Mr. Davis, I just want to make sure when we did talk to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| I had gone out, you and I have spoke, that we are going to make sure that the barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| the natural barrier is definitely kept up that backs up to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| And Mr. Gilmater, Paul Gilmater, I think he and I were friends for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| and if I did something I didn't say I would do for his daughter, he would come back and haunt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| I will do what I can to help with the families and meet with them up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| and help make sure we create a buffer if we have to take down the existing natural buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| I am going to go with, I'm going to make a motion to approve three units per acre due to Fox Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| and some of the other issues around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| So that will be my motion that I'm going to make a motion to approve three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Motion to approve three units per acre by Commissioner Oster with a second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2419)|

| 0:40:27| I want to make a substitute motion for four units per acre per planning commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| Substitute motion is four units per acre per planning commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Motion made by Commissioner Ward with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| All those in favor for the substitute motion of planning commission's recommendation of four dwelling units an acre, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-zoning?start=2456)|
