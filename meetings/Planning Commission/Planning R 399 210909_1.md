| 2:11:26| Thank you, Mr. Ackley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| Thank you. I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| quick question about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| common area, the 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| acres. Is there anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| planned for that? Is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| to be undisturbed or are there trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| to be natural space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| We don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| create a maintenance burden on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| few residents there are. I know it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| sounds like a lot, but if we were to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| an amenity or something, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| monthly dues would be quite high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| However, you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| one of the conditions, and it's shown on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| that we are dedicating a 30 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| greenway trail easement along the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| as requested by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| county parks and recs for some future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| facility that I guess the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| intends or wants the ability to build there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| which we welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| But for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| it'll just be area for kids to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| play, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| parents try to keep them out of the creek, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| The other question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| about is there any connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| developments, a trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| is there anything that would prevent someone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| moving between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| if they chose to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| Well, there's currently an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| culvert crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| because the existing owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| have a barn on the opposite side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| I've not inspected it thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| It obviously is not strong enough for a vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| but if it's not causing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| any other impediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| and it's existing, I'd check with TDAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| If they'll let me leave it, I'll leave it, and then there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| at least a way for people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| walk across the creek, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| I've not evaluated the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| of it myself to recommend whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| it should stay. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| TDAC's answer would be, please remove it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| and return the stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| to its normalcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| It's quite a large fetch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| there between Top of Bank on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| that section of Conner Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| so any kind of, even a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| crossing would be quite costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| An arch bridge or something of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| nature, but we've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| explored that in much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| detail as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| how to connect both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| The barn would actually go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| but just below the barn is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| an existing culvert with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| a concrete deck on it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| they've used for tractors for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| who knows how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8032)|

| 2:16:36| I don't think it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| take that long. This is a continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| of an existing plan we came back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| On a rezoning, nothing has changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| The only point of order would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| that we have identified that there is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| sinkhole and not two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| I have a letter from TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| that they did approve a class 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| injection well. That was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| as part of the later package to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| and I yield the rest of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8218)|

| 2:17:32| asked county staff about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| about the injection well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| and allowing that sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| to continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| useful in taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8260)|

| 2:19:24| Included in the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8364)|

| 2:19:28| approval from, or I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| on the WAG bags for the solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| disposal. That approval is based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| on a normal household use. If you're adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| three campsites with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8376)|

| 2:19:46| be handled and taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8386)|

| 2:19:50| Yes, and then I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| want some clarification. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| going to be any sort of quiet hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| or anything like that imposed? I know a lot of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| are going to come to Tennessee to camp don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| have the same school schedules. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| lot of students in there if they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| parties or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| camping there during our school seasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8406)|

| 2:20:10| is that going to be imposed? And is anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| actually going to stay there on the campground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8412)|

| 2:20:16| full time, or is that going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| sent out to a management company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8418)|

| 2:20:42| just addressing the concerns that my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| neighbor presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| There will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| some quiet hours, whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| they're imposed, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| also am concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| The house that's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| property I currently live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8456)|

| 2:21:02| and so there will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| a management company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| Ultimately, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| third point is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| toilet facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| will not be used from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| facilities in the home. Instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| the way that the tender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| company kind of runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| this, essentially, is that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| non-permanent toilet that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| provided, and there's a bagging system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8488)|

| 2:21:36| they use, that letter there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| by the Tennessee Environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| and Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| Department, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| the bags that we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| are essentially similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| diapers, which diapers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| allowed to be disposed of in regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| household trash bins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| so the policy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| the tender site is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| the campers will bring their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| trash with them or otherwise pay a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| and I'll dispose of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| So those are the three points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| Just to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| some background about what I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| for to the board here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| that ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| the land that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| this is on is a 24-acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| property pretty close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| here, close to the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8542)|
| 2:22:24| Knoxville. As soon as you drive in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| driveway, it's kind of like a little hidden oasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| My family and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| absolutely love it. There's deer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| there's peacock, there's rabbits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| just rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| green hills and acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| and our thought was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| that why keep this just to ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| which is why we decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| to look into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| camp site here. It's not super| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| lucrative, so it's not necessarily a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| money issue. It's more of how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| share this beautiful place that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| being said, because I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| planning on having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| camps, a limited number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| campsites, I plan on keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| or adding vegetation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| property. I'm not planning on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| taking down any trees as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| it relates to this, but I plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| on adding some as a part of the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| which I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| Excuse me, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| Graff. I can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| Get a little closer to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| Sure. Is this better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| Yes, that's a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| So in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| this is a campground, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| technically correct, although it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| not what most people think of as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| a campground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| At most there'll be three sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| I actually only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| intend on doing one or two, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| I've applied for three. That way I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| the flexibility of changing locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| if one works better than another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| my intention. I will have it limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| to one vehicle per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| camper at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| the way that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| tenter site works is that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| booked through the tenter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| site, and then I'm notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| of when someone is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| And there is a liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| policy that's in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| a $2 million general liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| policy in place if something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| were to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| I have considered personally myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| safety issues, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| because the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| is registering online, their personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| information is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| should the need arise for a police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| unit to be involved. So we can identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| The tenter has told me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| since they've been operating since 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| they have over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| 1,000 campsites, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| 70% residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| and 30% on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| state parks, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| they've not had any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| come forth with personal injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| property items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| being destroyed or ruined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| which is why I'm personally comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| with the safety aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| And so ultimately, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| want to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| toilet is similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| a diaper and can be disposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| of in normal household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| trash, I would like to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| that this is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| without the requirement of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| SPAP. Otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| I'm happy to accept the other conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8726)|
| 2:25:32| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| will recognize Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| I know you drove over there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| It's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| windy getting back to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| the entrance is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| Is there any, I don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| know if this is allowed, are you planning on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| putting a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| entrance to your driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| Yeah, I plan on putting a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| below my mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| So just below the mailbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| I don't plan on having other signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Google Maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| is generally sufficient in getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| a person to the location. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| dependent on it when I first moved there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| so I don't find that to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| Is that allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| to put a sign? I plan on having it below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| the sign limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| should be less than two feet by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| So there's not a permit needed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8792)|
| 2:26:36| I'd have to look at the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| to confirm, but I'll look right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Can you tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| it's hard for me to tell up on this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8802)|
| 2:26:44| how close is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| some of these campsites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| the three that are on this map, how close are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| to the backyard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| some of the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| There should be a site map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| in there that's marking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| the spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| Yeah, it should be that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| So there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| one on the lower right-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| corner, two on the upper left-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| corner. There is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| also a parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| that's adjacent to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| which is also mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| Notice on the upper left, that's about five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| That is also mine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| So those two in the upper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| left-hand corner are closest to that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| And those are probably the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| that are closest to the residences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| Not directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| So if you kind of look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| where the two X's are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| yeah, if you go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| a little bit to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| you see that line there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| That's another residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| That's another neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| You see a couple of little gray lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| that's where the residents are, so it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| right up against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| The locations that I plotted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| out are a little bit more secluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Is that like, what, 50 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| Or how much would you estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| How far is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| Probably at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| 200 from the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| And I know you are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| on maybe getting the other piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| zoned with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| so that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| do something similar maybe on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| If so, would you change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| the entrance from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| into accessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| those three campsites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| Or would that always be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| entrance that the campers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| will use to access it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| It'll be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| entrance. There is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| access point across the railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| but for safety concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| I wasn't going to be directing people that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| I just worry, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| people coming, especially late at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| they're trying to get to the campsite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| To me, I felt like it was a little hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| to find it. I passed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| before, and I know there was even the rezoning sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| outside, or the special use sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| I didn't even see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| The driveway seems a little narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| I just would hate, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| I just would hate for a lot of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| to be brought to that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| Especially people not being able to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| the entrance to the campground late at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| night, driving around in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| circle coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| I think also that there's no sign existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| currently, that that makes it difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8968)|
| 2:29:30| identify which house, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| entrance this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Like I said, I'm only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| planning on having a limit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| one vehicle per tenter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| so it'd be at most three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| Although, like I said, I'm really only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| intending on one to start out with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| and maybe two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| Most people that come to camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| they don't kind of go in and out all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| They kind of come, and then they go when they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| One, two, three cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| that would come in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| over the course of a day or a weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| is really about all that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| really be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| Okay, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| I would like to have some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| I think it would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| to everyone if there was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| that indicated where they needed to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| to get access to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| I think it would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| to everyone if there was some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| indication to know where to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| on your driveway to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| those lots so there's not a lot of needless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| traffic driving around looking for that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| And I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| what we can do for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| To answer the first question, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| Minus, that you had, it's in the Ag District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| Identification signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| detached or attached to a building are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| for public parks, playgrounds, and other outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| recreation uses with a maximum sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| area of nine feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| and a maximum height of eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| So she would be permitted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| add a sign because this would fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| into the other outdoor recreational uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9052)|
| 2:31:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| You said that there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| particular exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| that you wanted to have removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| Yes, SPAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| which is the issue regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| and since this has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| really been addressed by the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| that was provided, given that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| is similar to a diaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| allowable to be disposed of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| through regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| household trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| I guess maybe I should ask staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| I'm looking for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| item that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| applicant is referencing and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| seeing it. I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| that's within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| Planning Commission's authority. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| if she were to go to permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| that would be handled as part of the permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| process with the city. I think that was noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| in the staff comments but not as a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| Yes, I have a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| and a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| The question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| 10-acre site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| and we're only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| being asked to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| 3 campsites on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| Where does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| Do you come back next year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| ask for 10 more campsites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| and the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| 10 more so that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| got 30 or 40 or 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9156)|
| 2:32:38| back there? Or do we keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| at 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| that you'll have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| and ask for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| because we're only approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| 3 but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| we go through this every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| Well, we've already established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| that it is a camping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9176)|
| 2:32:58| area because we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| approved 3 so now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| we need to approve 10 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9182)|
| 2:33:08| What are we doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| Are we approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| if this was cut out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| that we were going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| 3 campsites on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| 1 acre and that acre was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| different from the rest of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| you might have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| little leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| to say no, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| 1 acre was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| not the other 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| But here we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| just putting 3 campsites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| on 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| what's the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| you're addressing a question to whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9228)|
| 2:33:50| the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| Right now you're only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| considering 3. They would have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| for additional requests to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| to the special use process. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| but there's 10 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| there to come back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| That's correct. But they'd still have to come back and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9246)|
| 2:34:08| and staff would have to evaluate that and make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| So are we saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| we're going to make this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| 10 acres available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| to how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| tents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| We're saying 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| now so you're kind of making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| hypothetical situation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| should we be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| Because we're only going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| first thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| Ms. Minus that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| this is a hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| campsite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| even to find the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| you have to wind through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| quite a bit. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| it's not easy to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| That's the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| unless you've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| GPS in your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| But then you get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| and there's two driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| where the sign is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| That's what I did but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| you're going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| That's one thing if you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| three cars going through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| if you're opening it up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| campsites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| then you've got 50 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| I think we ought to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| on a bigger scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| than just three campsites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| Thank you Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| I make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| Before we get a vote I want to recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| Yeah I was just going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| what Commissioner Graff is saying but I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| we could be asking for 20 camps right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| People can ask for anything in the future they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| It's our job to vote it up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| depending on whether it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| She may do these three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| and the neighbors may say hey it's not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| We may do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| or we may say this has been a disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| and no we shouldn't have done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| but I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| you can worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| they're going to come back and ask for more later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| This is kind of a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| My only thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| the only thing I think we have to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| we're taking a property that's industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| this is an agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| we have to look at the campground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| regulations in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| My question is about waste disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| because I do see in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| where it has to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| by the city. Is this method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| of waste disposal acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| with our city regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| Is this an acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| waste disposal method?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| It seems, and you have to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| this is kind of a weird one for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| We don't have many things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| I believe I'm the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| Yeah, we're just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| But is the bag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| the waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| and you're going to rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| on the campers to dispose of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| Yeah, that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| policy. They have the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| pay an up charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| for me to dispose of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| but I expect most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| probably will handle it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| So they will take it off site with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9448)|
| 2:37:30| And so where would they go with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| Probably to their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| Do you think they're going to drive that trash all the way home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| That's what you do with diapers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| It's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| Okay, I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9460)|
| 2:37:42| But is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9462)|
| 2:37:44| an acceptable method from the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| standpoint of waste disposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| speak on all the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| but Stormwater did have a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| and that's the reason why we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| making the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| aware of the special pollution abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| permit process to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| that waste is at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| managed on site properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| waste is getting into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| containment system that they're planning on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| using and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| hopefully being not left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| on site or whatever but being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| managed properly however that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| To me that's the only gray area I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| is how that works and whether that's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| method with the city. Like if you were going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| septics, septic tanks for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| campsite then I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| I don't know, I think that was a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| standard way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| But anyway, those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| Yeah I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| I was just going to ask if we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| if Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| would be interested in adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| amendment or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| for a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| or is that something that's going to have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| permitted through the city? The city would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| that. I don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| required, is it Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| Any sign would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| have to be permitted through the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| unless it's explicitly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| I can't tell you right now whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| the type of sign that she's interested in doing would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| exempt or not. I'm not familiar enough with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| the In-N-Out's sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| Would she have to have a sign though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| No, she wouldn't have to have a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| Yeah I mean I guess I'm kind of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| back and forth because I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| while I think a sign would be nice for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| traffic because I think it's a little confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| finding that driveway especially if it's at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| I don't know what the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| how the neighbors feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| She said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| there was a sign. Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| wanted to speak to Commissioner Midas's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| concern and to some of the things that Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| Graff had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| If you've used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| Airbnb or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| VRBO, I haven't used Tinter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| always come with pretty explicit instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| for here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| how you come to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| Look for this. Come in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| Even with things like if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| to a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| property in a downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| you need to speak to the concierge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| first and then do this. So they're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| detailed which I would assume that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| applicant is going to be doing in her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| instructions on Tinter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| It only helps her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| have a better camper experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| if she does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| So in terms of signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| I think that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| the place where the instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| are relayed so that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| avoiding people swirling around and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| lost. That's not good for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| thing is that in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| of quantity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| with camping, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| more campsites you add, you begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| to get a diminishing return. People| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| don't want to stay there if there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| a lot of campsites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| The fewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| the better. So I think that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| some built-in mechanisms to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| this particular new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| initiative, which I applaud by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| small and kept in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| manageable size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| that people can have a positive experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| not only the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| and the campers, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| the community members around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| Commissioner Higgins, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| I know you have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| So we do have Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| Well, I was just going to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| in listening to all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| indicated that we really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| no purview over the waste. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| really a permitting issue, and the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| already addressed that they're going to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| we've camped out here long enough, so I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| be ready to move this on to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| So we have a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| We have a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| seconded by Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| the CRESP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| first draft recommendation for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| campsites. All in favor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| Hearing none, the motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| Thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| Mr. Chair, before we go on to the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| just because Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| Uten said it earlier, this will be my monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| I really hope that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| urban growth plan is seriously getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9762)|

| 2:45:38| of history, so please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| In 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9940)|

| 2:45:50| three-quarters of a million people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| shared their vision for the future of the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9952)|

| 2:46:00| emerged as one of the top two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| In 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| a group of citizens with strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| community support behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| successfully advocated for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| ban on new billboards in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| In 2008, another group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| citizens, again with strong community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| support, successfully advocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| for a ban on digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| In 2009, City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| banned on-premise digital signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| grandfathered signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| of which there are few left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| must hold constant for 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| seconds, and flashing, scrolling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| and animation are prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| In 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| County Commission banned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10000)|

| 2:46:44| and subjected on-premise digital signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| to the same conditions listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| above. And finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| in 2015, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| three-and-a-half years of study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| and many hours of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| City Council enacted a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| sign ordinance designed to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| I relate this history to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| because I would like both the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| and the Commission to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| that this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| and its legislative bodies have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| long demonstrated strong support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| for a beautified city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| and county, free from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| unattractive and garish signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| None of the legislative actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| I've cited here were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| taken quickly, easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| or without extensive public feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| Against this backdrop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10048)|
| 2:47:30| Scenic Knoxville is alarmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10050)|
| 2:47:32| by the many exceptions to the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| ordinance that the applicant has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10054)|

| 2:48:18| is granted as part of the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| development approval, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10100)|

| 2:48:40| a substantial benefit to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| We commend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| applicant for detailing the many public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| benefits that will derive from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| development as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| However, the applicant has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| described any public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| as required by the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| that will be gained from not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| following the existing sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| So we ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| how will having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| billboards and animated digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| signs make Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| a better place to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| To be clear, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| only concerned with signage that's visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| We know some of the signs will be used inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| and we have no issue with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| as long as they can't be seen from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| In conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| we think the exterior stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10164)|
| 2:49:26| signage should recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| and respect the values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| and vision of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| the values and vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| the city of Knoxville has adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| over the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10176)|
| 2:49:38| We are requesting there be limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| placed on the type and size of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| signs that will be visible from the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| We especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| oppose billboards, digital animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| signs, digital animated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| signs, very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| signs, and excessive signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| in general. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| oppose revenue generating signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| that advertise products or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| sponsors. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| preliminary plan before you has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| provided any standards for how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| signs will be used. Therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| this plan is incomplete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| in our view, and for that reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| this body might consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| requesting a new preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| for signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10216)|
| 2:50:18| We believe that the time to set standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| is now rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| after the master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| has been submitted in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| phase of the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10226)|

| 2:50:34| you have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10234)|

| 2:50:38| Mr. Murphy, if you could be cognizant of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| and give time for Ms. Korbelik to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10242)|

| 2:50:48| I'm here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| a suggestion. I didn't hit the neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10250)|
| 2:50:52| button when signing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10252)|
| 2:50:54| First, I want to acknowledge and express appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| for a really comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| package, and the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| for what I'm sure was a lot of analysis and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| feedback and work that went into this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| It's comprehensive, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10266)|
| 2:51:08| what we all need and want a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| development proposal to be, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| thanks to everybody who put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| KCPA's concern, which is shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| with Scenic Knoxville, is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10276)|
| 2:51:18| around the exceptions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| the design standards and just the magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| in that we don't have a lot of specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10282)|
| 2:51:24| yet about what it will look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| particularly related to landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| lighting, and signage. We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| acknowledge, at this point, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| really impossible to know exactly what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| design will be and what the precise exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| are, so that's why there's a pretty long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| many of you have probably heard the old adage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| of trust but verify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| and so we do have a lot of trust in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| the designers. These are very well-known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| local firms. They have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| best interest of the community at heart, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| have a lot of trust in the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| at the city and in planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| but given the substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| exceptions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| they're requesting, we think maybe a verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| step is appropriate. So staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| has got condition number three in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| their recommendation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10326)|
| 2:52:08| requires the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| the signage, and the lighting plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| to be submitted as part of the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| plan for plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10334)|
| 2:52:18| When they submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| a final plan, after it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| goes to staff and they give their comments and it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| through some cycles, it comes to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| and your choices are only to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| or deny it, so you don't have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| really at the final plan step to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| make a lot of modifications there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| We're suggesting that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| for the lighting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| landscaping plans, that those be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| that you add a condition in, that those be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| possibly reviewed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| a special use application, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| comes to you before the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| development plan, and that way you can see them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| you can give comments, and you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| modify them in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| I believe the applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| in their master signage plan. They're planning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| use that process, and that is already a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| so that kind of fits that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| So really, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| we're asking for, is just an extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| verification step in there, particularly around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| landscaping and signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| or landscaping, signage, and lighting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10390)|

| 2:53:28| I'm not for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| the project. I'm speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| this evening because I'm for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| the Planning Commission, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| I have sat here for several hours because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| I think my message to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| is actually quite important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| The stadium is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| very controversial and complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| and of course, there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| a lot of exceptions looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| in going through the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| Some of these exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| are quite detailed, and some are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| pretty wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| that the wide open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| exceptions could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| end up being a poor reflection on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| the Planning Commission, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| why I think that this might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| be the case. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| looking specifically at lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| the alternative landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| and the master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| signage. We know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| if the final plan is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| substantial compliance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10468)|
| 2:54:30| preliminary plan, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| you have to approve it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| You cannot add any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| conditions to the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| know that the preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| details come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| planning staff, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| again, their authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| at the final plan stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| is totally based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| the wording of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| exceptions, and if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| exception is very broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| planning staff does not have authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| to send it back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| developer for additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| when we are looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| at granting exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| we need to understand the latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| it might actually end up allowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| The alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| landscape plan, you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| have authority to review the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| plaza or any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| proposed landscape variations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| that the developer might propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| It's up to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| to make that decision, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| again, the question of compatibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| which is a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| for granting a conditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| is up to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| to determine. How you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| that without the details is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| understand. Lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| plan. Again, you will not be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| to judge how the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10554)|
| 2:55:56| and the exceptions to that design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| will impact the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| that is proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| which is a benefit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| the project, but you will not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| how it will impact that housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| and you will not know how it will impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| the community overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| the several very open-ended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| exceptions in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| master sign plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| is also before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| Ms. Korblick, excuse me one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| I'm going to extend the time for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| two minutes, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| applicant will have an additional two minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| as well. Continue. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| If the final plan is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| in substantial conformance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| preliminary plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| again, staff can send it back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| applicant for modification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| but if the exception is quite broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| then we're in a limbo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| land, and the staff's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| is quite limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| I am asking the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| commission to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| that lighting the alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| landscape plan come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| back with a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| review, as would be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| for the master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| I'm not asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| that you figure out if you have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| to require this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| process, because that will take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| a long time and many lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| I'm simply asking that you consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| this motion to show that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| have concern about the latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| necessary with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| this special exception process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| for our unique project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| but that you're concerned that the latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| meets the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| of being compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10652)|

| 2:57:40| up, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| point out in the section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| on conditional approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| that the location and arrangements of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10666)|

| 2:57:54| compatible with the surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| and adjacent land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10676)|
| 2:57:58| In some cases, the exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| requested have not demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| that compatibility, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| you don't have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| If there is a process by which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| you could, down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| get a preliminary plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| back for these three elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| you could, in good conscience, make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| a decision as to their applicability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| I just think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10700)|
| 2:58:22| to consider that while you have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| authority to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| because once it comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| as a final plan, it's either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| And that's kind of lamenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10714)|
| 2:58:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| Okay, Applegate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| before I come on up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| before I let you speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| Commissioner Hale, you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| to make a statement before we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| Yes, I wanted to provide two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| disclosures. One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| that I am a member of the Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| Authority Board, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| if you're not familiar with the responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10736)|
| 2:58:58| of the Sports Authority Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| the initial responsibility is very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| to what this board is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| It will make a recommendation to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10744)|
| 2:59:06| and the county if it's a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| And then, as it moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| then we're responsible for the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10752)|
| 2:59:14| of the stadium. I have no financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10754)|
| 2:59:16| interest. I don't get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| for that job, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| I don't believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| I'll be, I know I won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| affected in any way, and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10766)|
| 2:59:28| impartial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| during this. And my second disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| is that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| a property in close proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| and this project could impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| positively or negatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| I'm not sure, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| it's approximately 1%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| of our assets, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| it's considered insignificant, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| it will not affect my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| impartiality to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| Go ahead. I'm Doug Kirchhofer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| Post Office Box 51887| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10798)|
| 3:00:00| Knoxville, 37950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| Before I comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| this is my first Planet Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| and I want to thank all of you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| service in this very important role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| Could you, you want to move the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| up there? You're a little taller than our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| previous speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10814)|
| 3:00:20| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| Speak a little closer to the mic, and you'll be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10824)|
| 3:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10828)|
| 3:00:30| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10832)|
| 3:00:34| As I said, I'm Doug Kirchhofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| I'm the Chief Executive Officer of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| Boyd Sports. You probably know Boyd Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| better as the Tennessee Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10840)|
| 3:00:42| I'm here today on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| of an affiliate company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| of the Smokies, RRLand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| I want to really just make a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| of comments and then turn it over to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| who have put this application together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| Over the past three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| the owner has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| engaged a team of exceptional professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| to answer the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| question of what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| might look like if a publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| funded stadium, what it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| look like for a publicly funded stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| and the private development that might take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| place in the property immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| adjacent to that stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| to prepare for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| to prepare to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| in the event that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| and the county, the county commission and city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| council, were to approve such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| a publicly funded stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| So, in order, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| process and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| work that the professionals have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| I mean, this is part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| to look at land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| and zoning. And with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| I'd like to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10906)|

| 3:01:52| part of the project team. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10912)|

| 3:02:06| East Oklahoma Avenue. I'm with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| Jim Associated Architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| representing Mr. Kirchhofer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| and the other developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10932)|
| 3:02:14| owners for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10934)|
| 3:02:16| I was going to give a quick... Could you speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| up a little bit? You can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10938)|
| 3:02:20| the mask off unless you're not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| My intent was to come and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| to make sure to give an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| of the project and how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| approaching it with the planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| the site that we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| which is currently, as you know, east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| of the Hall of Fame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| viaduct, as this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10960)|
| 3:02:42| is a planned development with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| a multi-use stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| and city plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| private development around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10970)|
| 3:02:52| to pull that urban fabric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| of the old city and the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| west in the old city, just pull that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10978)|
| 3:03:00| through to the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10980)|
| 3:03:02| and using the planned development to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=10982)|

| 3:03:34| sits within that with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| development buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| immediately to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| with a public plaza between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| that building and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11022)|

| 3:03:48| the old city, the urban fabric, and then to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| north of Jackson, another private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11030)|

| 3:03:54| the east private development building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| along Jackson. There are a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| parcels to the east, there's one to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| east and two to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11040)|
| 3:04:02| of the stadium itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| that's there for future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| to continue the development of the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| development for that similar type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| density and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| fabric that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| we believe is necessary to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| not only extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11058)|

| 3:04:26| support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| activity of the entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| element of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| and its surrounding public spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| as well as how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11074)|
| 3:04:36| the greenways connect in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| as we see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| The development itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| is set to have two phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| just to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| how that first phase works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11086)|
| 3:04:48| the only distinction is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| private development building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| to the north of Jackson will initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| be a surface parking to help support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| the minor league baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| requirements for staff and players| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| in that initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| first phase with buildings to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| the west, to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| with the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| the stadium itself will have some retail development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| to help that activation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| of Jackson Avenue as we want to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| pull that urban pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| fabric from the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| and the downtown environment through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| into the new planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11122)|
| 3:05:24| and as we move to phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| the only distinction in phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| is the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| proposed closure of Humes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11130)|

| 3:05:34| to allow for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| private development building which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| be to the north to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| opposite the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| development to help create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| a more urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| retail extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| along Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| and as you see in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| next slide, it illustrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| there we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| to show how the intent of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| is to use the streetscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| pedestrian scale streetscapes that already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| exist in the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| on Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11168)|
| 3:06:10| west of central currently pulling that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| along Jackson Avenue to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| with that pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| connection and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| the buildings to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| that more urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| context with outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11182)|
| 3:06:24| spaces with retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| being on the street level and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| buildings both northeast and west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| with the west building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11192)|
| 3:06:34| activating that public plaza much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11194)|
| 3:06:36| like Market Square does with retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| on the ground floor with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| residential units all lifted above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11200)|
| 3:06:42| with their own dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| parking contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| within each of the building footprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| and then to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| the public connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11210)|
| 3:06:52| of the greenway coming from the Austin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| Homes development to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11214)|
| 3:06:56| connecting in and tying into that public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| plaza area to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| and just for clarification that we show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| the two different options for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| that public plaza as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| to that private development building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| that's designated as A to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| as it's continuing to be studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| for viability as to whether that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| what we're calling that annex is needed or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| so that public plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11236)|
| 3:07:18| has two different options shown there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| in the submittal and so I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| clarify that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| and as what we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| to accomplish with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| development is extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| those building heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| modifying some of the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| and stuff to help create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11254)|
| 3:07:36| that more urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11256)|
| 3:07:38| scaled environment with this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| as it pulls to the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| to the east across that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11262)|
| 3:07:44| what now is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11264)|
| 3:07:46| kind of barrier edge to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| downtown and in doing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11268)|
| 3:07:50| creating both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| a combination of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11272)|
| 3:07:54| mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| residential and retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| and commercial with the public spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| to activate this 365| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| as it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| that wants to be active all year round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11286)|

| 3:13:28| released an economic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| and revenue analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| that was conducted by a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11612)|
| 3:13:34| and just a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11614)|
| 3:13:36| of highlights. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| $280 million in direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11618)|
| 3:13:40| spending and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| $477 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11622)|
| 3:13:44| of total impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11624)|
| 3:13:46| just from the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11626)|
| 3:13:48| development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11628)|
| 3:13:50| the private development that's part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| plan. This doesn't include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| the development that we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| know is coming right behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11636)|
| 3:13:58| this. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11638)|
| 3:14:00| the direct impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| of the stadium would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| at least a couple of hundred jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| I think that our colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| that are directly involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11648)|
| 3:14:10| in the business model will tell you that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| even more than that. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| talking about jobs and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| and the stimulation of an economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| that could really use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| that kind of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11662)|
| 3:14:24| the big thing that I want to get across to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| is that we're talking about with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| a generational opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11668)|
| 3:14:30| that we can't pass up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11670)|
| 3:14:32| This is a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| the area where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11674)|
| 3:14:36| project is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11676)|
| 3:14:38| to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| is an area that was destroyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| by urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11682)|
| 3:14:44| The uses that followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11686)|
| 3:14:48| although created jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| further cut the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| off and the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| East Knoxville community off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| from our downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11696)|
| 3:14:58| We have an opportunity because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11698)|
| 3:15:00| we have a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11700)|
| 3:15:02| citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11702)|
| 3:15:04| who is also a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| philanthropist and has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| exceptionally engaged in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| as we've traveled around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11710)|
| 3:15:12| and looked at other stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11712)|
| 3:15:14| projects, we hear repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| do you guys know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11716)|
| 3:15:18| how lucky you are to have a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11718)|
| 3:15:20| investor who is leading this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| effort? That's not happening in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| communities. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11724)|
| 3:15:26| dying to get people to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| and from other places to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11728)|
| 3:15:30| make this kind of investment. So we have a local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| philanthropist, investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| and a long-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| resident, local person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| who is interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| making this happen and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| been generous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| enough to bring folks to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| table to create up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11746)|
| 3:15:48| package that's being brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11748)|
| 3:15:50| to you today. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11750)|
| 3:15:52| thrilled. The city is thrilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| to be in support of this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11754)|
| 3:15:56| to be partnering with this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11756)|
| 3:15:58| to bring this forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| I'll be here if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11760)|
| 3:16:02| Thank you. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11764)|
| 3:16:06| Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11766)|
| 3:16:08| will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11768)|
| 3:16:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| just to follow up a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| Thinking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11774)|
| 3:16:16| this process, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| a lot of steps that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| they all have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11780)|
| 3:16:22| This body being one of them, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11782)|
| 3:16:24| in this process is something that most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| developers don't have to go through and that's the Sports Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11786)|
| 3:16:28| Board. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| I think what we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| to think about is from a planning standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| the time I've been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| it's been right at a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11796)|
| 3:16:38| We've talked about Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11798)|
| 3:16:40| West Knoxville, North Knoxville, South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11800)|
| 3:16:42| Knoxville, Far East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| There have been very few opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| in this part of East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| Knoxville that have come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| and this is a huge investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| that is being looked at in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| that hasn't seen a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| this type of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11816)|
| 3:16:58| in a community. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| from our standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| we're looking at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| the staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| All the other stuff we have to set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| But I do want to just challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| Commissioner Hill who sits on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| the Sports Authority that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| I think you all need to just take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| this back that we expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| the Sports Authority to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| with the city and all the design and the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| and everything that we've all talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11842)|
| 3:17:24| we don't need to put more barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| in the way of something of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| magnitude that they have to come back and present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| 30 different times the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| stuff. So I would just encourage you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| to work with Scenic Knoxville to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| that we're not breaking precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| of what has happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| It fits in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| All the lighting stuff we've talked about over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11862)|
| 3:17:44| years fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| So with that, and I see some other lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| before I make the motion to approve staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| recommendation, I wanted to defer to my other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11870)|
| 3:17:52| colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| if they've got any other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11874)|
| 3:17:56| Chair will recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| Commissioner Hill. Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11878)|
| 3:18:00| I want to speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11880)|
| 3:18:04| three speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11884)|
| 3:18:06| that had signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11886)|
| 3:18:08| Ms. Korbelick and Ms. Feld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11888)|
| 3:18:10| and Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| I think they challenge us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| and they make our community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11894)|
| 3:18:16| We don't always agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11896)|
| 3:18:18| But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| want to make sure that we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11900)|
| 3:18:22| the process. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| will be approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| or considering a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11906)|
| 3:18:28| preliminary plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11908)|
| 3:18:32| The signage will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| by way of special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| process. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11916)|
| 3:18:38| I want to make sure that we're all clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| that it's not an up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| I'm not saying that they said that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| an up or down vote when they present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11924)|
| 3:18:46| the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11926)|
| 3:18:48| This will be separate. Correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11928)|
| 3:18:50| if I'm wrong with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11930)|
| 3:18:52| That is correct. It's going to come back as a master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| What we're saying today is, hey, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| what, we will consider signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| that otherwise would not be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11940)|
| 3:19:02| subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| if they're appropriate in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| master sign package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| So I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11950)|
| 3:19:12| 155 page package that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| got Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| It's a lot of information and it's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| to take in and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| hope that especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| some of the newer planning commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| this can be overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11964)|
| 3:19:26| It can be overwhelming for people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11966)|
| 3:19:28| are in the business. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| Chair recognizes Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11972)|
| 3:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11974)|
| 3:19:38| As I was listening to the arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| and listening to the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| people that spoke about the lot and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| we addressed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| in the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| and there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| there is an approval process and there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11990)|
| 3:19:52| process that we will have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| go through and I echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| what Tim said. Making them go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| through 30 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| gyrations that we normally would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| not do, I don't think is conducive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12002)|
| 3:20:04| to either getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| this project to the point where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| an up or down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12008)|
| 3:20:10| I think it would help expedite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| not to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| and I think we're dealing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12014)|
| 3:20:16| and in our conditions we're safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12016)|
| 3:20:18| that they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| without some kind of a variance they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12020)|
| 3:20:22| basically have to abide by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12022)|
| 3:20:24| sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| and I think our staff and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12026)|
| 3:20:28| the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12028)|
| 3:20:30| people will ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| and the sports authority board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| will ensure that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| adhered to and then we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| opportunity when it comes to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12038)|
| 3:20:40| if it's not, if we don't think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12040)|
| 3:20:42| we have the opportunity to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12044)|
| 3:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| I really appreciate this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| because I do want to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| I understand what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12056)|
| 3:20:58| and so thanks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| everyone engaging in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| Clarity on the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12062)|
| 3:21:04| because if I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12064)|
| 3:21:06| Commissioner Hill correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12066)|
| 3:21:08| you were saying that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12070)|
| 3:21:12| once that master signage package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12072)|
| 3:21:14| comes, if there was a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12074)|
| 3:21:16| of it that we didn't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12076)|
| 3:21:18| hypothetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| a billboard, we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| But does that mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| it's not just a no to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12086)|
| 3:21:28| is that an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12088)|
| 3:21:30| up or down or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| do we have that flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| It's a special use process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| that we go through separate of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12098)|
| 3:21:40| If that was the case, it goes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| the special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| would the answer come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| that said well it was allowed as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| exception at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12108)|
| 3:21:50| so why do you not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12110)|
| 3:21:52| that? Is that a potentiality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12112)|
| 3:21:54| And I'm just using a billboard as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| straw sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| I think those kind of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| Commissioner were best answered by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| Ms. Porche or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12124)|
| 3:22:06| Ms. Brooks could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| probably address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| appropriately. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| Yeah, you guys are correct in saying that the master sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| plan is done as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| process so this board does have the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12136)|
| 3:22:18| add conditions to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12138)|
| 3:22:20| package as you would with any special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| use. If there was anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12142)|
| 3:22:24| that you decided was inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| for whatever reason, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| hopefully yes, staff would have caught that already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| and addressed it, but if there's something that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| don't agree with, you would certainly have the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| address that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| Also, I want to comment a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| little bit about the landscaping and the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| since that was also brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| The landscaping, the alternative landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12162)|
| 3:22:44| plan has to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12164)|
| 3:22:46| to the administrative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12166)|
| 3:22:48| and that's not just planning staff, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| it's engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12170)|
| 3:22:52| KUB, plans review and inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12172)|
| 3:22:54| stormwater, fire, economic and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12174)|
| 3:22:56| development, so there are a number of departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12176)|
| 3:22:58| that go in and look at it, similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| to a concept plan, so it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12180)|
| 3:23:02| just a simple rubber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12182)|
| 3:23:04| stamp, it's a back and forth process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| like any other plan that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12186)|
| 3:23:08| and we do have the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| again, impose conditions, make requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12190)|
| 3:23:12| comments as part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| The lighting plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12194)|
| 3:23:16| that's the one that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| administrative by staff, but it's looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| a combination of the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12200)|
| 3:23:22| standards that are in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12202)|
| 3:23:24| those that they have not requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| an exception from, they would be required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| follow. The ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| that they have requested exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| for do have some built in mechanisms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| for example, the flashing lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12214)|
| 3:23:36| those kinds of things, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| are permitted event by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| event on a case by case basis through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12220)|
| 3:23:42| the office of special events, and so we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| built language into there that they be pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12224)|
| 3:23:46| internally, that they not impact traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| either air or vehicular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12228)|
| 3:23:50| so that gives the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| office of special events the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| ability to be able to judge those kinds of things as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| they issue those permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12236)|
| 3:23:58| So I hope I've addressed your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12238)|
| 3:24:00| but I'm able to answer more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12240)|
| 3:24:02| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12242)|
| 3:24:04| need to be able to say it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12244)|
| 3:24:06| to make sure I got it, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12246)|
| 3:24:08| So the signage comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12248)|
| 3:24:10| back as a special use, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12250)|
| 3:24:12| chance for review, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12252)|
| 3:24:14| landscaping comes back as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| special use, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12256)|
| 3:24:18| no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12258)|
| 3:24:20| Landscaping goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12260)|
| 3:24:22| to a committee built of several departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12262)|
| 3:24:24| between the city and planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12266)|
| 3:24:28| lighting is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12268)|
| 3:24:30| So it's only the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12270)|
| 3:24:32| currently that comes back as a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12272)|
| 3:24:34| use. It is only the signage that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12274)|
| 3:24:36| back as a special use. Lighting would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| there would be review done by us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12278)|
| 3:24:40| but that also would be done as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12280)|
| 3:24:42| the final plan process that you guys would all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12282)|
| 3:24:44| see. Lighting is one of those things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12284)|
| 3:24:46| when they're building the buildings, they're going to need, they're going to know where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| it's going to go, so that would be part of the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| It's not like I'm going to be judging the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| in my office, just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| me, myself, and I. It'll be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12294)|
| 3:24:56| that will be part of it, but then it will also come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| before this body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| Commissioner Higgins. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12304)|
| 3:25:08| So I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12308)|
| 3:25:10| I've read through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12310)|
| 3:25:12| this, and this is, this issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12312)|
| 3:25:14| quite thoroughly around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| page 100 in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12316)|
| 3:25:18| but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12318)|
| 3:25:20| a little curious if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12320)|
| 3:25:24| what the implications of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12324)|
| 3:25:26| you know, based off the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| and whatnot, and if it's in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12328)|
| 3:25:30| purview to comment on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12330)|
| 3:25:32| even, but, and I also hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12332)|
| 3:25:34| to be the one beating this dead horse, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12334)|
| 3:25:36| parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12336)|
| 3:25:38| is a serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| issue that a lot of people have brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12340)|
| 3:25:42| in relationship to this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| and I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12344)|
| 3:25:46| I fully support the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| of this, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12348)|
| 3:25:50| that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12350)|
| 3:25:52| project is really incredible, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12352)|
| 3:25:54| am seriously concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12354)|
| 3:25:56| about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12356)|
| 3:25:58| lack of parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| of new parking. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12360)|
| 3:26:02| I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12362)|
| 3:26:04| the development only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12364)|
| 3:26:06| anticipates including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| the one parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| for staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12370)|
| 3:26:12| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12372)|
| 3:26:24| Brad Salisbury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12384)|
| 3:26:26| SNME 6515,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| Naughty Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12388)|
| 3:26:30| To parking. Let me get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12390)|
| 3:26:32| up here. Can you all hear me? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12392)|
| 3:26:34| Yes, right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12394)|
| 3:26:36| the parking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12396)|
| 3:26:38| staff and stadium events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12398)|
| 3:26:40| is associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12400)|
| 3:26:42| that small lot there, and then there'll be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| as that's developed in the second phase, there'll be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12404)|
| 3:26:46| parking associated with that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| So, would the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| associated with the new building, would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| be public parking? Would that be for use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| of visitors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12414)|
| 3:26:56| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| phase two garage there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| that would be for tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12420)|
| 3:27:02| and patrons of the businesses, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12422)|
| 3:27:04| the people that live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12424)|
| 3:27:06| in that building, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| employees and direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12428)|
| 3:27:10| usage for the stadium, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12430)|
| 3:27:12| not be publicly available parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12432)|
| 3:27:14| So, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12434)|
| 3:27:16| there are games and events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12436)|
| 3:27:18| the majority of participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| would not be parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| in that garage. They would be looking for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12442)|
| 3:27:24| elsewhere, correct? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| When there are games, when there are events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| and we're working with CAT on this exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12448)|
| 3:27:30| question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12450)|
| 3:27:32| the majority of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| parking would be within that mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| is kind of what we've looked at, and said, alright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| what's a reasonable walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| to the stadium in the Old City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12460)|
| 3:27:42| in downtown, in what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12462)|
| 3:27:44| And that mile radius was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12464)|
| 3:27:46| kind of where we came up with, and said, alright, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| try and just see what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12468)|
| 3:27:50| And there's a lot of available parking garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12470)|
| 3:27:52| there's the Coliseum, there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12472)|
| 3:27:54| parking availability associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12474)|
| 3:27:56| within that footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12476)|
| 3:27:58| Well, that mile radius is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12478)|
| 3:28:00| part of what caught my eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12480)|
| 3:28:02| and concern about this, because when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12482)|
| 3:28:04| look at the map that was included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12484)|
| 3:28:06| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12486)|
| 3:28:08| green, yellow, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| the hatched area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12492)|
| 3:28:14| familiar with every single one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| of those, and I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| every Friday night, every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12498)|
| 3:28:20| Saturday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12500)|
| 3:28:22| those are majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12502)|
| 3:28:24| full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12504)|
| 3:28:26| And even on some weeknights, some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| those are completely full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| and that's just with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| traffic that we have downtown right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12512)|
| 3:28:34| without a few thousand other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| people visiting. There's a lot of event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| centers on Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12518)|
| 3:28:40| and I really appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12520)|

| 3:28:46| possible options for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12526)|
| 3:28:48| parking and moving people. My concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12528)|
| 3:28:50| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12530)|
| 3:28:52| what do you do about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| the ones that are within the quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12534)|
| 3:28:56| mile or the half mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12536)|
| 3:28:58| that are going to completely fill up, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12538)|
| 3:29:00| residents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| patrons to other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| are now going out and trying to ride a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12546)|

| 3:29:10| or to get dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| Is there any intention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| address restrictions on the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| that is most immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| to the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| Let me see if I've got the question right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| Is there a process that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| identify just stadium parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| and block parking off and say this is for stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| only? Yeah, like some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| public parking, and I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| that this is the case, but there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12574)|
| 3:29:36| of PBA lots around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| there. Will those still be open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| because those are free nights and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12580)|
| 3:29:42| weekends. Will those continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| free and open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12584)|
| 3:29:46| I assume they would be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12586)|
| 3:29:48| stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| visitors, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| I can't really speak for PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12592)|
| 3:29:54| and necessarily the city, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12594)|
| 3:29:56| our assumption is that yes, those would all still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12596)|
| 3:29:58| open and free, that they would not take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12598)|
| 3:30:00| a publicly available garage right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12600)|
| 3:30:02| now and close it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12602)|
| 3:30:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12604)|
| 3:30:06| That's kind of our assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12606)|
| 3:30:08| Okay. You know, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12608)|
| 3:30:10| concern is just that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12610)|
| 3:30:12| a lot of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12612)|
| 3:30:14| and a lot of people who visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| downtown for reasons other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| than this who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| depend on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12620)|
| 3:30:22| parking that is here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| I don't necessarily want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12624)|
| 3:30:26| object| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12626)|
| 3:30:28| to this, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12628)|
| 3:30:30| I don't really know what the solution here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12630)|
| 3:30:32| is, but I do know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12632)|
| 3:30:34| this will displace a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12634)|
| 3:30:36| people who already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12636)|
| 3:30:38| use this area frequently, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12638)|
| 3:30:40| I think that's something that needs to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| a little more strongly than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| we'll figure it out and put people on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12644)|
| 3:30:46| cab buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12646)|
| 3:30:48| Again, at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12648)|
| 3:30:50| I don't have a great suggestion, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12650)|
| 3:30:52| anyone else has any thoughts on that, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| really like to hear other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| commissioners' thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12656)|
| 3:30:58| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12658)|
| 3:31:00| This is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12660)|
| 3:31:02| a solution, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12662)|
| 3:31:04| a comment to what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12664)|
| 3:31:06| saying. I have lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12666)|
| 3:31:08| in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12668)|
| 3:31:10| I've lived in Port| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12670)|
| 3:31:12| Sanders, and I've lived in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12672)|
| 3:31:14| Knoxville, and I've lived in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12674)|
| 3:31:16| West Knoxville, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| three of those places that I've lived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12678)|
| 3:31:20| or those different neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| have had to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12682)|
| 3:31:24| UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12684)|
| 3:31:26| Fall brings with it many lovely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12686)|
| 3:31:28| things. It also brings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12688)|
| 3:31:30| the football games that, for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12690)|
| 3:31:32| people, that is the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| thing. But if you're a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12694)|
| 3:31:36| who lives in one of those three areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12696)|
| 3:31:38| it means you have to deal with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12698)|
| 3:31:40| It means you have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| okay, how am I going to get from my house to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12702)|
| 3:31:44| groceries today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12704)|
| 3:31:46| But my point is, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| are realities that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12708)|
| 3:31:50| deal with as a resident who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| I want to live here. Yep, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12712)|
| 3:31:54| deal with the football game. I'm going to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12714)|
| 3:31:56| with this thing because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12716)|
| 3:31:58| important enough to me to be in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| That's a hassle I'll put up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| And I plan ahead. And that's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| of, I think, what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12724)|
| 3:32:06| being in a real city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12726)|
| 3:32:08| is that you deal with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12730)|
| 3:32:12| do think it needs to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12732)|
| 3:32:14| thoughtfully. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12734)|
| 3:32:16| when you're in a real city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12736)|
| 3:32:18| those are realities that you deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| And typically, the city is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12740)|
| 3:32:22| also playing a role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12742)|
| 3:32:24| to give those heads up, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12744)|
| 3:32:26| help guide the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12746)|
| 3:32:28| who are coming to that event, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12748)|
| 3:32:30| as the residents so that they've got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12750)|
| 3:32:32| release gaskets that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| can use, that they're not always being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| displaced. So that would be my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12756)|
| 3:32:38| comment back to some of those tightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12758)|
| 3:32:40| that we're going to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12760)|
| 3:32:45| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| And I would just add that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12767)|
| 3:32:49| while yes, there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| some available free parking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| fills up, I think we let the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| sector take over. I mean, if you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| got a business in that area and you want to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12777)|
| 3:32:59| your parking lot, it's an extra revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12779)|
| 3:33:01| source. I think, go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| out this coming Saturday, and you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| find businesses that aren't open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| that are selling their parking lots. A lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12787)|
| 3:33:09| non-profits, businesses allow non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| to come in to raise money on parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| I don't think we need to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| getting into, government has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| to provide everything. I think we let the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12797)|
| 3:33:19| take care of some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| Trust me, people will get creative in how they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| going to find parking. If nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| else, if they park wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| KPD is going to see an influx| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12807)|
| 3:33:29| of revenue from parking tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12809)|
| 3:33:31| Again, you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| the chance of how you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| find parking when games are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| So I think we've got to leave some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| things to just the creativity of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| community to figure out how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| want to go about addressing this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| they're going to come up with solutions. They always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| have. So with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12827)|
| 3:33:49| and seeing, sorry, I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| I don't want to make the motion until everybody's had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| I'll say Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| This kind of reminds me of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| stadium in Atlanta with the Braves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| They built just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| infinitesimal amount of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| And they've utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| parking from within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| People walk across the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| to get to it, build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| up on every game night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| And I think a lot of times planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| have kind of over-requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| on parking. And we've got so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| surface lots around, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| over, not only Knoxville, all over the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| that sit vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12863)|
| 3:34:25| most of the time. And I think kind of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12865)|
| 3:34:27| will kind of tend to work itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| out over time. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| agree that the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| let them deal with it. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12873)|
| 3:34:35| it can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| I'm less worried about the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| than most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| and then Commissioner Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| Yeah, I was just going to agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12885)|
| 3:34:47| I mean, I completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| think that this investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| this stadium, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| you're going to do down there, you need to create some parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| just, I think it's going to be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| if you're going to invest all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12899)|
| 3:35:01| this money and I'm completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| supportive of it. But just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| expect to add no parking hardly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12905)|
| 3:35:07| except for your staff and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12907)|
| 3:35:09| flood, use everybody else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| parking that lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| down there. I think it's going to be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12913)|
| 3:35:15| If I was going to spend this much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12915)|
| 3:35:17| I'd want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| set aside or have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| parking generated to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12921)|
| 3:35:23| all the additional people that are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12923)|
| 3:35:25| down there. That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| So I think parking is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12927)|
| 3:35:31| Commissioner Morales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12931)|
| 3:35:33| I'll be fast. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12933)|
| 3:35:35| understand. I agree with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| The one thing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| feel is I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| this will give an opportunity for people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| start using CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| and they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| realize, hey, this is pretty nice. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| have to drive. I don't have to worry about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| And they might end up using it other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| I do worry about the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| most particularly downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| if people who may not be willing to go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| if there's a game. But I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| this is going to bring a lot more business to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| area and increase their revenue in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12963)|
| 3:36:07| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| I just want to quantify the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| I mean, it's a 7,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| seat stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12973)|
| 3:36:15| We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| 2,200 parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| spaces at the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| that stay empty for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| most part. I think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| figure out the rest of it because they're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| going to average during the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| 4,000 fans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| It may be capacity at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| I think it's a manageable problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=12997)|
| 3:36:41| I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13003)|
| 3:36:45| I fully support the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13005)|
| 3:36:47| and I agree with a lot of those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13007)|
| 3:36:51| I know that downtown has a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| of parking and garages and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| that it's completely fair to put the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| of the creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| on the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| and on the people that are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| What I'll say is I really hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| that the use of CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| and the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| parking garages and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| is effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| and that there's a lot of energy that goes into marketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| and making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| that burden doesn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| I don't want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| crushed because people find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| a way, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13047)|
| 3:37:31| it will be a burden on some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| in the area. Hopefully we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| lighten that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| with good marketing and outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13057)|
| 3:37:39| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13059)|
| 3:37:43| One or two very quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13063)|
| 3:37:45| Thank you all for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| I'm hearing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13067)|
| 3:37:49| and I don't disagree with everything that you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| That's one of the questions that we've been asked is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13071)|
| 3:37:53| how are we going to park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| We've taken a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| logical step-by-step approach of let's figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| out what the inventory is and let's figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| what the available inventory is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| during these times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13083)|
| 3:38:05| We're able to actually simulate some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| the heavier downtown uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| as we were looking at, thankfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| because this time of year downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13091)|
| 3:38:13| is really active and really vibrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| We're able to go out on Saturday nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| and see what is being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13097)|
| 3:38:19| how much is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| There's a lot more available than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| you would think. It surprised me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| how much was available within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| radius. Now, within the core of the Old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| City, yeah, it's really full. It's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| packed. There's absolutely no doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| about it and we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| That's the reason that this is a great spot for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13115)|
| 3:38:39| In the design of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| stadium and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| the private developments around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| the residents of the complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| the residents in those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| all will have parking provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13129)|

| 3:38:53| expectation that the residents of those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| will have to go elsewhere to find parking. That part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| will be provided. I just wanted to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13137)|
| 3:38:59| that was clear as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13139)|

| 3:39:55| Next item is item number 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| and before I nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| the committee, I want to open it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13199)|
| 3:40:05| It's last on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| Before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| name that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| I'll recognize Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13211)|
| 3:40:15| No, I think it's number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13215)|
| 3:40:21| 7 is last. Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| Two things. First,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| of years I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| commission off and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13231)|
| 3:40:35| there's always been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| somebody on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13237)|
| 3:40:39| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| is familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| with no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| how far out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| is, and I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| like to thank Chris Uten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| for leading us through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13253)|
| 3:40:55| that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| The 14 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| us sat here with a blank look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| on our face and let him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| do the whole job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| and without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| him, we'd probably still be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13267)|
| 3:41:09| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| I just really feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| Thank you, Chris. The other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13275)|
| 3:41:21| I feel like Biden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13283)|
| 3:41:27| The terms of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13289)|
| 3:41:33| I only got out 14 to 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| three times today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| so I feel pretty good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| 13 to 1, Dick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13299)|
| 3:41:41| 13 to 1. You're doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| We're missing one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| I feel even better now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13305)|
| 3:41:51| With the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| upcoming election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13313)|
| 3:41:55| and nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13315)|
| 3:41:57| we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13317)|
| 3:41:59| looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13319)|
| 3:42:01| someone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| serve from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13323)|
| 3:42:05| January through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13327)|
| 3:42:09| We have a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| vice president right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| I'm sure would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13337)|
| 3:42:19| move up and be chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| but his term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| expires in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13343)|
| 3:42:27| What I'm proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| if we elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13351)|
| 3:42:33| someone whose term is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13353)|
| 3:42:35| going to expire in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| whether it's Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| Smith or someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13359)|
| 3:42:41| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| change the term of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| from July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13365)|
| 3:42:47| to June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13367)|
| 3:42:49| so that we don't get stuck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13371)|
| 3:42:53| 18-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13373)|
| 3:42:57| term of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13377)|
| 3:42:59| because that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13379)|
| 3:43:01| we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13381)|
| 3:43:05| If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13385)|
| 3:43:07| elect somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13387)|
| 3:43:09| that only serves six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13389)|
| 3:43:11| then we'll elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13391)|
| 3:43:13| somebody else to serve six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| and then we'll say, well, they have only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| been chair for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13397)|
| 3:43:19| We need to give them another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| I really believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| that the term of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| that you should serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13405)|
| 3:43:27| for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13407)|
| 3:43:29| and you'll come off and be a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| commissioner after one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| than you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13413)|
| 3:43:35| if you've never been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13415)|
| 3:43:37| a chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| I think we have several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| well-qualified people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13421)|
| 3:43:43| on this board right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13427)|
| 3:43:51| what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| proposing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13433)|
| 3:43:55| nothing new. When I first came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13435)|
| 3:43:57| on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| the term of office was from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| June to July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| ran consecutive with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| terms. The only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13447)|
| 3:44:09| reason we changed it was new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| people coming on didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| know who they were really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| voting for because they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| They hadn't met them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| and they were asked to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13459)|
| 3:44:21| for somebody that they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13461)|
| 3:44:23| know. That's why we changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13463)|
| 3:44:25| it, but we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13465)|
| 3:44:27| a cycle now where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| I don't think it's working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| not working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13471)|
| 3:44:35| I really think we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13475)|

| 3:44:59| have a whole year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13499)|

| 3:45:03| six month or we get trapped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13503)|

| 3:45:25| a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| It would be proper next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13529)|

| 3:45:33| up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13533)|
| 3:45:39| The comment I would have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| how about we address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| it after we seat the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| officers because it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| that the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13547)|
| 3:45:49| does, his term doesn't expire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13549)|
| 3:45:51| and then we could address it after it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| and that's why I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13553)|
| 3:45:55| saying we could vote on it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| I'm just saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| if we nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| someone that's only going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| to serve six months, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| we should change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| term of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| and then the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| person wouldn't serve six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| months, they'd serve a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13575)|
| 3:46:19| You either get six months or 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13579)|
| 3:46:23| I don't think we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| be in that 18 month cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13585)|
| 3:46:27| It just messes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| things up. I think for some of the newer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| commission, I don't mean to be out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13591)|

| 3:46:35| understand the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| of the chair is one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| but they could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13599)|
| 3:46:41| multiple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| as long as they're reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13603)|

| 3:46:59| a six months person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| then let's change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13621)|
| 3:47:03| the term of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13623)|

| 3:50:36| Mr. Chair, would you like to come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13836)|

| 3:50:40| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13840)|
| 3:50:42| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13842)|
| 3:50:44| My name is Chris Cherry. My address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13844)|
| 3:50:46| is 1305 Beacon Hill Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13846)|
| 3:50:48| I moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13848)|
| 3:50:50| to Sequoia Hills about 14 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13850)|
| 3:50:52| coming to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13852)|

| 3:50:56| had at the time two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13856)|
| 3:50:58| toddler daughters and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13858)|
| 3:51:00| moved into Sequoia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13860)|
| 3:51:02| Hills in part because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13862)|
| 3:51:04| one of the best neighborhoods, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13864)|
| 3:51:06| Park access was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13866)|
| 3:51:08| fundamental to where we chose to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13868)|
| 3:51:12| We have now two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13872)|
| 3:51:14| young kids. Our youngsters are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13874)|
| 3:51:16| teenagers and now we have eight and nine-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13876)|
| 3:51:18| It's still an important access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13878)|
| 3:51:20| point for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13880)|
| 3:51:22| We paid a premium for this access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13882)|
| 3:51:24| We looked at a lot of houses that cost less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13884)|
| 3:51:26| that were farther from the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13886)|
| 3:51:28| and we bought the house we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13888)|
| 3:51:30| for this access. We found this access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13890)|
| 3:51:32| on digital maps. When we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13892)|
| 3:51:34| moved in, of course, we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13894)|
| 3:51:36| around and we figured out which one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13896)|
| 3:51:38| the safest and easiest way to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13898)|
| 3:51:40| to the park and this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13900)|
| 3:51:42| It's not on a heavy trafficked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13902)|
| 3:51:44| road and it goes directly to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13904)|
| 3:51:46| park. It avoids the less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13906)|
| 3:51:48| savory parts of the park, which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13908)|
| 3:51:50| the kind of chaotic parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13910)|
| 3:51:52| lot and then the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13912)|
| 3:51:54| let's say, a couple hundred yards of dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13914)|
| 3:51:56| poo that kind of litters the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13916)|
| 3:51:58| bit of the park itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13918)|
| 3:52:00| It's a really great place to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13920)|
| 3:52:02| the park and it's closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210909?start=13922)|
