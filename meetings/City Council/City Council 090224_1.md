| 2:36:32| Councilman Frost has a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| I'd like to take the opportunity to move item 11A as an alpha to this point of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9395)|
| 2:36:41| There are some people here for that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9401)|
| 2:36:44| It will be a brief matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9404)|

| 2:41:44| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9704)|
| 2:41:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9705)|
| 2:41:46| Now, I support this notion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| but I thought we had discussed it earlier at previous council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| but I guess my comments now are going to be really directed to this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| and the next two things involving signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| I mean, you know, folks heard Mr. Grieve here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| This was about his 13th time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9721)|
| 2:42:04| I mean, there are, you know, as much as I appreciate good government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9724)|
| 2:42:13| I am personally at the point where I think we're wearing down citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| we are wearing down folks in the signage community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| where we're here no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| Agree or disagree on each side of these issues, we will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9746)|
| 2:42:31| We have people that have to plan, and they're volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| and they're here every other week religiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| And at some point, and I think we've reached that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| we are becoming unfair to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| where we practically need a moratorium on sign issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| I mean, I've talked to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| The people in the sign industry who know exactly where I stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| they feel exacerbated, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| The people, you know, I just, you know, I've been frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| I know everything is well-intentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| but at some point the public needs to be given a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9789)|
| 2:43:15| Can I maybe make a suggestion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| Rather than do that, the first question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| is it even legal in Tennessee to take these and amortize them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| I would like to suggest, before we go through all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9806)|
| 2:43:27| that we let our legal department do the first step and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| is it legal before we go through all the steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| And I've talked to Debbie, and they're willing to take that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| and then report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| I'd like to, my own suggestion would be that this be postponed, withdrawn, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| until our legal department comes back and says it can be pursued or can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9822)|
| 2:43:46| At that point in time, council could take it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| But, Ms. Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9829)|
| 2:43:50| Well, I'll make a substitute motion then, in view of the comments the mayor has just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| that we postpone these, I would like to say the three items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9835)|
| 2:44:00| and have some legal advice before we proceed any further on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9840)|
| 2:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9848)|
| 2:44:09| The motion, I guess, is C, D, and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9849)|
| 2:44:13| I included all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| Ms. Pelo, would you consider a tabling rather than a postponement to a time indeterminate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9857)|
| 2:44:23| Well, the mayor had indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| I mean, tabling is just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9866)|
| 2:44:27| I think the best thing, before everybody goes to a whole lot of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| let us do the first step and say, here's what legally, we won't tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9869)|
| 2:44:33| just legally here's what we think you can or can't do, and then you can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| So we're okay if you'd rather table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| However you'd like to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9879)|
| 2:44:40| You know, I like the tabling idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9883)|
| 2:44:44| I will change my motion or amend it to state these three items be tabled until we have better legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9884)|
| 2:44:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9895)|
| 2:44:56| Counselor Hookless, is that a light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| I think it's interesting, Ms. Pelo, if you had said C and D, I'd be happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| C, we don't need, it's actually in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| I was going to withdraw D anyway because we have dealt with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9907)|
| 2:45:10| I think E is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| And, Mr. Forrest, I appreciate what you're saying about us overtaxing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| but we sort of left a lot of loose ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| We said, you know, EMCs are banned except for the places where they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9919)|
| 2:45:25| which are these new zoning districts, some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| We kind of left some loose ends that I'd like to clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| I think that a lot of this stuff with master signage plans is still very regulatory in what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9931)|
| 2:45:40| It's very static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| If you have this many square feet, you get this many signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| I don't think that's a good way for us to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| So I'd like to continue on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| We know a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| There are people that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9949)|
| 2:45:50| It's an issue that we do understand at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| So I'd like to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| So I'm going to vote against the tabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| Is that still a light or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9958)|
| 2:45:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9959)|
| 2:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| Mr. Becker, I appreciate where you're coming from on E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| I would suggest that it's maybe appropriate to table that and we could introduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9966)|
| 2:46:11| someone could introduce a different resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| Since you're proposing a task force by resolution of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| my suggestion would be to create the task force by resolution of council rather than dumping it on the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9977)|
| 2:46:22| But maybe he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| But I think that's a more reasonable way to do something like that rather than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9984)|
| 2:46:29| It was a request from the administration that they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9992)|
| 2:46:33| Well, I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| You know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9995)|
| 2:46:36| I'm not sure the administration knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| Well, we were just saying that any task force we would like to be a part of so it doesn't take off in different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| So we can do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| I mean, we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| I personally would say my own thing would be let's table them all to a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| until we come back to you on it with some legal guidelines of what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| That's my personal thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10021)|
| 2:47:02| Ms. Pilo, is that a light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| No, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| The motion on the table is to table 11C, D, and E until we return to you with some additional legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10025)|
| 2:47:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090224?start=10033)|
