| 0:00:58| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of October the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=63)|
| 0:01:03| Any corrections, additions, deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Items dealing with the agenda, any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| OK, any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| Ms. Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| This is not for tonight, but on the November 2nd meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| we are scheduled to hear again this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| property on Middlebrook Pike, and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| the parties involved are working toward a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| And it's a work in progress, and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| will need an additional two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| to keep that work progressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| I'll be asking for that next week, or the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| I'm sorry, I missed the withdrawal call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| OK, we can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| I would like to ask to withdraw 11L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| And the reason is, in consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| with Mr. Donaldson and MPC, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| is a better way to come forward with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| Let me know that in 2008, state law changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| and amendments like this can either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| be initiated by the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| or they can be initiated by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| And what we did here is kind of wrote it the old-fashioned way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| where we asked the planning commission to please do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| In fact, we can actually initiate the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| ourselves, which is probably a cleaner way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| So I'm going to ask to withdraw 11L tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| and bring it back in two weeks with some cleaner language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| All those in favor of withdrawing 11L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=158)|
| 0:02:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Those no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| OK, it's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Yeah, I wanted to say a word at the beginning about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| I guess it's 12A, the R4MU1 regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=164)|
| 0:02:52| Met with Mr. Swanson today, and talked a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| about some options for how we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| on that that might actually eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| come to a postponement to allow language to be gotten together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| But I don't want to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| I want to do that when it comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| so we've actually got some time to talk about what we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| and how we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| But I wanted to let folks know at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| of the meeting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| OK, and excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry, I didn't see Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| I'd like to add 11M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| 11M, and it's seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| OK, all those in favor of adding 11M, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=218)|
| 0:03:38| Those no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| OK, it's added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| OK, and we do not have any consent items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=222)|

| 0:07:24| at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| And this Thursday, the KUB commissioners will meet and they will look at what panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| recommendations can be implemented and other specifics about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| And that report will be online by Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=458)|

| 0:07:58| Some other things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| The Cumberland Estates Neighborhood Watch is having their Chili Supper on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| this Thursday, at 6 p.m. at the Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=484)|

| 0:08:13| the historic Westview community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| And a historian has done quite a bit of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| I think that would be a good event, beautiful weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| And finally, I have asked a couple people from CAC to come and talk specifically or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| share with us the report from the Office on Aging and to talk about the One Call program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| And Ms. Peters will be handing out handouts and Barbara Monte will be speaking with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| about both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Thank you for inviting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| I am Barbara Monte and I'm the director of the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| Committee Office on Aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| And we did bring you our annual report for the period that ended June 30, 2010, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=531)|
| 0:09:00| some information about all of the, and there are, every time I count them, I get a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| count, but it's somewhere like 20 programs that are part of the Office on Aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| And I will just call to your attention the back page where, in their own words, we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| some of what I call our love notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| When I get discouraged or feeling down, I pull it out and read it and it makes me feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| One of the other things we've given you is a copy of the brochure for our upcoming workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| Aging, a Family Affair, on November 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| And I want to sort of personally invite each of you, counsel and the mayor, to attend at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| least the keynote address as my personal guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| The keynote address is Jim McConnell from Portland, Oregon, who was really the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| of an exciting new alternative to the traditional nursing home, an adult care home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| And he's going to be talking about this and I think and hope you would all be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| in it because it's one of the kinds of new, innovative approaches that we're hoping to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| get started in Tennessee and in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| And so if you're at all interested in coming, just let me know and I'll make sure you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| And then the last thing, as Councilman Palmer indicated, was the One Call Club, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| one of the newer programs of the Office on Aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| One of our members called it the best kept secret, the best thing that happened to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| since they ended prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| She probably remembers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| One Call Club is designed, started out to be particularly for seniors, to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| get the kinds of services they needed to make them be able to stay in their homes and avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| the nursing home experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| We've had, by popular demand, the community has asked us and so it's now available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| anybody who will admit to being 50 years or older and takes some of the hassle out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| The program checks out and makes sure that the people who are providing the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| will have all been carefully vetted and reference checked and will do a good job and they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| get the value for their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| We have a special deal for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=692)|

| 0:11:46| After January 1st, it's going to cost $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| There are brochures here for both Aging a Family Affair and the One Call Club and Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Palmer and I think Councilman, former Councilman Palo is here and they both serve on our advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| board and are wonderful supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=724)|

| 0:12:06| Thank you, Ms. Monte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| I really do, just a quick reminder, this is a great Christmas present for someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| is older and if you are a caregiver and a full-time worker and mom calls and the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| is leaking, it's really good to be able to have a One Call Club membership and not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| to drop everything and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Ms. Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| I just wanted to remind everybody that early voting is currently going on at voting locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| across the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| They are open daily from 11 until 7 and in the last few days, daily except Sunday, excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| me, from 11 to 7 in the last few days, we'll pick up the hours in a few more locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| but here in the city, you can vote here in the city county building at Love Kitchen where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=765)|

| 0:13:01| Mr. Delavobe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Before we leave the seniors, the One Call does it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| The phone number, which is the best kept secret since the prohibition, is 524-2786, 524-2786.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| Jot it down, call it and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| One is related to workshops but before that, I want to just do a follow-up on the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| we just got, the $4.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| That was staffed by the staff of the Transportation Planning Organization, which Ms. Palmer represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| city council on that and I actually wanted to take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| They did an incredible amount of work in a really short time and I just wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Ms. Palmer at the next opportunity to sort of express our thanks to the TPO staff for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| how hard they worked on that and what a good job they did because that's a big step so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Workshop situation, a little bit of a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| I want to fill you in on what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| We have on November 11th a workshop scheduled on vacant properties and absentee landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=837)|
| 0:14:06| We'll be developing an agenda and we'll get a draft out to everybody hopefully in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| We currently have a workshop scheduled next Thursday, October 28th on the Ridge and Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| Task Force report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Got a call about 4.30 this afternoon from the chair of that task force asking if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| could do a joint workshop with the Metropolitan Planning Commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Have not actually had a chance to talk to anybody from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| I'm hoping Mr. Donaldson knows what I'm talking about and hopefully I can catch up with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| and the chair of MPC but before I did that I wanted to check with council to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| that is an okay thing and I know, I will go ahead and just recognize, I see Ms. Palmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| has a comment and ask whether it is okay for us to expand this into a joint workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| with both us and the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| What about the County Commission because they're in the midst of addressing this issue also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| I mean, to invite them to attend the workshop would help them perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=907)|
| 0:15:17| Okay, the worry I have is just how many people are sitting in the chairs trying to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| but it's actually, it wouldn't be that huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| So all right, that's a good thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Well, let me expand the question, what do you all think of the entire, the MPC, County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| Commission, City Council workshop on slope and hillsides on October 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Any bio opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| What I've, Dwayne, do you have a brief, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Dwayne called me today also and I specifically asked him about the County Commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| he said that his thinking was that it would be for the MPC commissioners and us because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| of the number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| What I think, what I know people sometimes like to think on these things and it's come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| up obviously fairly quickly for us, I think I'll ask Ms. Mitchell if she can get an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| out tomorrow just saying does anybody have any follow up thoughts on this and we probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| got until Thursday to finalize this so we can do that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| Final workshop that's been talked about is one on minority contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| We are, as you all know, out of workshop dates until January and January right now feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| a year away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| At this moment, although we've tried, there is a potential date on November 4th but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| barely get a majority of council there and I don't particularly feel comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| scheduling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| I'd like to talk to a few more people, see if there are any options on that and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| this might be one that doesn't happen until next year just because of the way people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| schedules work out and I wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay, ready to move on then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Patrick Beasley to the City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1025)|

| 0:20:37| Mr. Delibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Yes, I wonder if I could ask Mr. King, exactly what kind of environmental issues do you expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| near the bridge rampway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| It sounds like something that's been there for a hundred years, but what are we looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| This is all part of the federal process to spend federal money, and what we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| is typically we're able to achieve a categorical exclusion, that's the term in the environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| process, because of the historic nature of that neighborhood and the designation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| the existing ramps are historic, we have to move into what's called a documented categorical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| exclusion, which involves more analysis and study in order to get the environmental clearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| But are we talking about the basic roadway ramps that go up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| And this is just a way to spend federal money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| This is a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| No, to spend it, you have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| To spend the money on the main project, you must get this clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Yes, we have to do this work in order to design and build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| The point is to rebuild the two ramps, that's what we're trying to get to, but the environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| process is just one of the steps that we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Well, yeah, and I was asking the question because I can see in a pristine field somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| we might want to be checking for environmental issues or archaeological issues, but I'm thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| this is a road bid, but okay, it's a hurdle we have to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| A $100,000 hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1336)|

| 0:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1340)|

| 0:22:25| 31?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| According to this, you're asking for three additional years, and I was curious as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| when the original date was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1353)|
| 0:22:42| It would have been in June of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| And so the reason it's three years is because of the ramps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| The reason it's three years is because it's anticipated it will take at least two to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| through this environmental process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1375)|

| 0:23:41| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| I have a couple of questions about this because as I read this, the contract covers the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| contract ends in June 30th, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Is that right, Mr. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| And this would cover a contract then from the years 2011 to 2012 and then 2013 to 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| So we're looking at actually about a three-year time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| What we're talking about tonight would actually expire in 2014, am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| We're recommending a three-year extension to the contract, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| With two one-year options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| And I guess the problem is related to the fact that by the third year of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| we would have elected a new mayor because our current mayor is term-limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| And we would need to think about the fact that we are binding not only the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| of Knoxville City but also a new mayor to a longer contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| So I'm comfortable with a one-year extension, but I'm not comfortable with three one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| And it's not because I don't think SMG is doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| I just think that it's something that we need to be prudent and not bind the taxpayers or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| And let me maybe make a philosophical, I understand the concern and, you know, one way or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| by that point in time, I won't be here and half of the council won't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| But I guess this is not the first time this has come up with contracts that carry over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I think the smart thing to do and why we recommend this, if it's the right thing to do, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| And you can't worry too much about, I mean, we inherited a whole lot of contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| You inherited a whole lot of contracts when you came on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| And I think if this body thinks the contract's a good one, I wouldn't let the fact that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| bridges administrations and bridges councils stop me from doing it because you can't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| put everything on hold knowing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| So that's just a philosophical issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| But that would be kind of my two cents worth on that particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| You don't have to exercise the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| The new mayor doesn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Well, it is actually, you don't have to exercise the two one years, but it is a three-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| So it would count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| So there's not a way out if at the end of two years the person doesn't want a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1551)|
| 0:25:59| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I didn't mean to exit the contract with notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| And just to speak to the reasons why we're recommending this, as is outlined, it's both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| financial and then other business considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| We have attempted to quantify for you what we know for certain to be a savings, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| is the $23,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| There are potentially other savings that come in the various incentive benchmarks that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| We did not estimate that for you because that depends on how the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| actually performs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| And so there are potential other savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| We think that those are significant and certainly in the best interest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| And then in addition to those financial, there are other business considerations here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| are in terms of a change is disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| And it's important in the convention center and the hospitality business that there be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| continuity of management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Much of the business that SMG is booking is business to be 12, 14, 18 months out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| These are key points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| And the people that they are booking that business want to make sure that the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| that they dealt with, the people who agreed to the contract, are there when their event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| So continuity of management is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| That would become fragile as you move toward the end of this current contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| And Council Member Palmer, as you and I discussed, there's a great deal of competition in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| around this region for that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| So it's important to us that we have that continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| And then I would add as well, we have been very happy with the teamwork that SMG has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| brought to this effort and teamwork in the sense of working with KTSC, who is an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| partner in this whole effort, plus the hotels downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| And SMG has managed to bridge both a cooperative and partnership with those hotels, likewise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| in a way competing with them for certain pieces of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| But she has been able to bridge that, and we're grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| And then finally, I would just tell you that SMG has been a consummate pro about managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| our convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| We have had continuous improvement in the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| They have brought support not just only in good quality management and staff here locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| but the support that we get from the corporate office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| And so we've been very pleased and really are very comfortable in recommending this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Thank you, Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. DellaVolpe, and then I'll come back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Mr. Martin, if I could just ask, just so I understand this, we pay them a base fee no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| matter what happens out there, the $195,000, and then it's designed so that if they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| bring in more business and have more food sales, they share some of the gross proceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| And that's in the food and beverage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| And then there is a qualitative incentive as well for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| And so the more business they can help us get, they get a piece of the action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| So they have a positive incentive to do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Mr. Pomerkin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| I would just like to dovetail off what I said about the sales part of it, because I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1780)|
| 0:29:51| there and done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| And it's not unusual at all, particularly for larger groups, particularly larger groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| to book two and three years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I mean, they don't generally, you might get one every now and then and get lucky and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| one within a 12-month period or just 18 months, but generally the larger conventions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| we would love to have here, you know, will be that far out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| And that continuity, having that salesperson and that team there is extremely important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| for the meeting planners and the folks that are going to have the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| So I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| My question relates to the amount that SMG is making available to the city for facility-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Would those funds, Mr. Martin, be used for upkeep, renovation, that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| My concern is I've noticed the last couple times I've been over there that there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| carpeting that is worn very thin along the Clinch Avenue concourse and wondered if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| was in our current year's budget or if any of the funds from this contract might address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Carpeting is being addressed separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| The amount of money that you're talking about is the $200,000, and there's a good bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| flexibility in the use of those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| They can be used in situations where it may be with city approval, where it may be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| in attracting business to our city, those sort of things that gives us some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1879)|
| 0:31:27| in our pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| The other part of it would be to be used for minor things that wouldn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| – I use the word minor, that's maybe not the best word – but those things that wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| necessarily be characterized as capital expenditures in our capital budget that are important pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1899)|
| 0:31:48| of equipment, furniture, what have you, that would be used in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| But all of that will be done in concert with SMG management and requires city approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| And the carpeting issue is on the radar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| As you know, we've had some litigation matters in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Item 7E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with UT Battelle LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| for the installation of a total of 10 solar-powered electric car charging stations at two city-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| garages, Market Square Garage and Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum Parking Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| at no cost to the city for equipment or installation and with transfer to the city of ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| and maintenance responsibilities for the stations once installation is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Mr. DelValby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Mr. Lyons, if I could ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| This is kind of a neat way of getting some of these charging units in our city garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| I was just curious, or the Coliseum Garage, I was just curious, will we have a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| number of vehicles we'll be testing in-house and using those facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| I believe these charging stations are not for the city's vehicles, but for the public's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| vehicles, to make a place available for folks who have them to be able to charge either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| for a while or for even overnight purposes, though I believe Susanna Bass could give more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Is there anything else to add to that, Susanna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| Yes, the idea, and obviously the city will have electric vehicles, but the idea is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| make it so that if you have an electric vehicle, you know no matter where you are, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| some recharging capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| You can come downtown and plug in and know you can get home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Or the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| Is there a charge for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| I don't think there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Susanna, there's no charge for the user, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| And these are solar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| They said there won't be any power demands either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| These work right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| This is a tremendous benefit because of the fact that the batteries will be charged by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| the solar panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| And we're going to have to go through a learning curve in terms of how to protect the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| We're going to install a couple more cameras in the Coliseum garage to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| have the appropriate security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| And the use of them, part of this is part of the statewide program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| Well, unfortunately, it's not quite statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| The folks in the west are concerned they're not involved, but we'll see whether we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| get a network that will support people having the electric cars and using them across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Will PBA maintain these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Maintained by PBA, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| We're going to explore that with public service and PBA, but it will most likely end up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| PBA's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I guess my question relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| As we know, free is only free in the beginning, and then when there's the ongoing operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| And I didn't see in this contract anywhere what we anticipate the ongoing operating costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| will be that we are agreeing to with the installation of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| I think they're a good idea, but it's always good to go in with your eyes wide open in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| terms of what the operating costs will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| And we've done a little bit of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| All three of the cities in Tennessee are asking this question, and we think that what we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| end up replacing will inherit the warranties from Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| We think that perhaps vandals will target the hoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| It's all electric, and if they do target hoses, the city will be obligated to replace those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| hoses as these stations are part of a data collection project for Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| So part of going through the equipment physically with public service and PBA will lead us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| the decision point of whose purview is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| When vandals do attack this, which organization will be responsible for replacing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| I guess I'm less concerned with the maintenance and repair than I am with the power bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| because we're also, as I read this, responsible for the power charges incurred by these charging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Initially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| There is only one entity in Knoxville, well, two really, Lenore City Utility and KUB, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| are able to charge for electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| So we would have to actually use sort of a camping site model where we would charge for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| the site, the parking space itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| And because the city is such a promoter of this project, initially, because the demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| or the adoption of electric vehicles is not tremendous at the start, this is kind of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| way of promoting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| And now if they become incredibly popular, we'll have to look at charging for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| And that would be a user fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| To plug in and to charge your vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Because I would think with the number of hours that it takes to charge a battery that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| know, I realize right now there are not a lot of cars and a lot of demand, but at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| point it could become significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| So that can be revised going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| That's definitely an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| These charging stations, would they be available at certain times, or when could people just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| go and use these charging stations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| These will essentially belong to the public, so they'll be able to access them at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| Mr. Delivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I guess this is part of our SolarCity initiative and the idea of bringing these kinds of industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| to this region, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| What is, I think it's, and you jump in and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| a joint initiative of the states, Oak Ridge National Lab and TVA trying to make electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| power, powered vehicles more customer friendly, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| And so they asked us and others, and Bill's right, there's a little bit of resentment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| in West Tennessee that nobody, that no charging stations were approved there, so it's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| of a, like I said, statewide saying, hey, we've got great partners here in TVA and ORNL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| let's see how we can pull this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| They'll have the parking franchise then if everyone's out in Memphis and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2279)|

| 0:38:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| I have some questions about this, and it's related to item 12C later in the agenda regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| the operating costs for the ice rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| If I understand correctly, this is just an expense to rent the equipment to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| ice, I guess, like a Zamboni, and then the skates themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| I guess, and Mr. Martin, maybe you're the best person for me to start with on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| I guess what I'm trying to get my arms around is what is the investment of taxpayer funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| overall in this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you for providing to me, I asked this afternoon for a copy of what we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| the budget might be to operate the rink, which relates to item 12C later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| And that budget actually shows that we think that we may end up with a small excess in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| funds if things go as anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| However, this item, 11G, I don't see covered anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| So 11G is strictly an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| 11G is 68,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| It's not in addition to, it's included in the 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Mr. York, you and I talked this afternoon, but it was very late in the day, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| The total anticipated budget for the ice rink is $190,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| That's 12C, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| That's 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| And that's $190,000 expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| As part of that $190,000, this contract we have budgeted at $69,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| So that's included in the 190 figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Now that I have the line item budget, I see that the 69,000 in that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| So that's included there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| So the total outlay of taxpayer funds to support this is essentially the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| as we've done in previous years in terms of our support of another entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| that put together this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| Would that be a correct statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| We have, in prior years, budgeted $40,000 in general fund support for the ice rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| That is our plan this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| The 12C actually shifted around, but it reduces by 41 place and increased by 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| So the general fund support or taxpayer support for this ice rink remains the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| as part of this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| There was some confusion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| I had a number of telephone calls and e-mails from folks who were confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| by some of the information that they read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| and thought that perhaps the taxpayer support of this project had increased dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| when the nonprofit that had run this previously decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| that they no longer could mount this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| So taxpayer dollars are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Last year, this year, we're just becoming the management partner of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| The question I have is that, first of all, I'm totally in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| I think it's a fantastic thing to have during the holiday to bring people downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| But my question is, what kind of support do we have from the local merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| or the downtown association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I remember, oh, gosh, it must have been 10 or 12 years ago when we were downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| I know we were a contributor to the ice rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| So where do we stand with contributions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| The current pledge that we have is we have a $15,000 pledge from Regal Cinemas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| or Regal Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| We're hopeful that we will receive additional support in either the form of sponsorships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| or from the sale of, I guess, advertising on the so-called Dasher boards around the rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2550)|
| 0:42:37| And that's still in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Special events is trying to sell those advertisements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| And, again, it's going reasonably well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| But until we have signed contracts, we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| I know all the merchants at downtown associations have been notified about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| And if anybody wishes to buy a Dasher board, we'll be happy to take your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| Mr. Dellibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Yeah, I just wanted to say, again, I'm supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| I think that this is a great way to bring families downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| and use the market square and the businesses that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| I wanted to ask Jim, I guess, when you talk about you think the revenues from the rink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| will equal or exceed operating expenses, is that the full 190 or is that less the 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| What number are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Well, that includes the $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| So the full amount that the taxpayers are investing on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| we hope to recoup from the actual sale of tickets to use the ice rink and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| Now, again, at this point, we expect expenses, again, it depends on, you know, clearly the weather and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2617)|
| 0:43:45| and so on to be about $190,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| The $190,000 in revenue includes the $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| So, again, we're expecting right now $150,000 from sales of rental of skates, sponsorships and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2634)|
| 0:44:03| But I'm saying with weather and conditions cooperating, you hope to basically break even or even put some money in the piggy bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| So that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| I'm sorry, I forgot to ask previously, Mr. York, do we have any idea how many people typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| how many skaters do we run through this, how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| It's around 15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| 15,000 people typically use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| And in the past, have the adjacent merchants participated in the funding costs of this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| Several of the merchants have purchased dasher boards in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| In terms of direct contribution, I think a couple of years ago there was some direct contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2680)|
| 0:44:48| CBID has made a contribution in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| CBID contribution is actually they're providing some of the equipment for the ice rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| And so, you know, again, that's kind of a break even from that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| And their contribution, the CBID contribution is not reflected in this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| That's correct, because they're providing in-kind, you know, equipment and supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| So, I mean, that also shows us that the actual total cost of putting this on is even greater than what we see here because of the in-kind piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| I also think it's a good thing for the city, for the downtown skating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| But I'm wondering, are there injuries with skating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| Would the city be liable if there are any type of injuries with this skating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| We've cleared this with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| We think everyone who skates will sign a waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| It's typical of all of our agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| So, I mean, we hope that there are no injuries, but, you know, there may be a twisted ankle or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| But we think our liability coverage is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| Commissioner Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Mr. Haslam, do people fall on the ice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Those of you who are new on council missed our council skating adventure a couple years ago, but maybe it's time for a reprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| Well, we'll bring that up this Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Jim and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| If I could, Mayor, I just wanted to make a personal comment here, and I hope this doesn't sound self-serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| But when this challenge came to the city for us to find a way to continue the ice rink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| we called upon a lot of different resources within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| It's amazing the talent that we have in the city from David Brace in public service, his people, Bob Polk, Mickey Maloney, Joe Walsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2794)|
| 0:46:46| Hannah Parker, just an array of people, not to mention our finance people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| And any time your finance people will put together a package and say, hey, we may make a little money here, you listen to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2811)|
| 0:46:59| But we'll be happy with breaking even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| But I wanted council to know what a team effort it was within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| and a lot of people dropped a lot of things to put some attention to this so that we could save the ice rink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Great, great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to contract number C110052| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| with the MC Painting Inc. for additional painting at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| so as to increase the contract price by $10,961 for a new contract amount of $87,646.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Commissioner Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Yeah, I think Bob Polk was not able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| He's helping over at the Coliseum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| But what they found out in painting the ceiling, and they've actually completed the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| and it's a gorgeous job that they've done over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| In painting the ceiling, they realized that some of the pieces they had held out to do themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| would require these high-lift devices and stuff that are fairly expensive to rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| The contractor already had them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| and they did some quick toting and realized they probably would save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| if they just got him to work on this other piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| So I think this is a prudent management decision to kind of use money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| So I move that we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2913)|

| 0:48:36| 11I is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| with Funderburg Electrical Services LLC for the RV parking electrical upgrade project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium Coliseum for an amount not to exceed $77,102.27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2925)|
| 0:48:52| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Mr. Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Yes, again, because I guess Bob Polk isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| I wanted to mention that he said that they hope to recoup this investment in about four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| because they will be renting these spaces to the RVs that come, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| whether it's holiday on ice or whether it's football game traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| or whether they can even troll in some of these folks who want to park their van| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| and spend a week in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| But they will be able to get higher fees for the higher amperage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| and apparently newer vehicles use more juice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| That's just the way it is, but it is a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| And the Alabama Flans are already plugged in, I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| Good news, bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=2976)|

| 0:51:13| that are complementary in scale to adjacent residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| We do have several folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Yeah, I just had a conversation with Mr. Swanson today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| thinking about how to move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Just sort of share my thinking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| This has been going on, as folks know, for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| It's come to Council several times and been postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| We have a report coming in from the Advisory Council with some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| When this started three years ago, I think there was a lot of support for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| Clearly, there is not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| We've all gotten a lot of e-mails from a lot of people saying don't do this in any form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| other people saying do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| In a way, it would be really easy, and we actually got a couple options on what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| We actually could sit here and work on the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| We could sit here and say, you know, take the ordinance we've got, make amendments, move forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| We could also refer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| What I'd sort of like to suggest is refer this to Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| and ask him to come with a comprehensive language on what has been recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| But I also, we've got sort of this hanging thing of are there people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| is there support for doing this in any form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| And it's always a little bit of a dicey kind of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| But at some level, even though Mr. Swanson is not a particularly expensive lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| it will cost us resources to have language drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| And if there are five people around this table who don't think we should move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| we don't need to ask him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| It feels like part of what, if there are people that want to go down that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| a move to deny would be a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| But at some point, and at some point I think that would be a really good discussion to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3183)|
| 0:53:10| because there is a point at which there is a very valid argument out there that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| there is potential good and potential bad to come out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| and it's our job to figure out which is which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| And I don't really intend to make that motion to deny tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| but I actually think it would be a good thing for us to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| The other option that I probably will make eventually is a motion that would be to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| and to ask Mr. Swanson to write up language for us to debate in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| So I wanted to share that with folks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Well, I'll take the bait and make a motion to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| We have heard a lot of neighborhoods and spokesmen from neighborhoods talk about the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3227)|
| 0:53:56| that this may actually harm some of the smaller neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| and the lower income neighborhoods be picked off for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| There doesn't seem to be the crying need to have this R4 district or even an MU1 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| although that was the recommendation of the advisory council to change the name of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| and get it out of residential and maybe get it more straightforward in terms of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| But long story short, I don't see the crying need for this either R4 or MU1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| and there seems to be a real concern that it may do more harm than good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| We do have mechanisms for people to get zoning changes to use structures out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| and I think Mr. Donaldson told us that under the old R4 that's in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| they only had two applications of that zone in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| So it's not a rampant need, and I think maybe we do more good by just denying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| and if we have to revisit it someday when the need is more apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| So I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| The motion was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Just a reminder, we do have folks out to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| How many speakers do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| We have, and let me just clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| I guess, Mr. Swanson, we've had this situation before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Right now we have three people signed up to speak, four and two against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| but the fours and against get flipped by the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| We've had a discussion about what happens, and remind me what we decided last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| Does everybody know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| What we have done in the past, because technically really a motion to deny here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| is not technically an appropriate motion because if you want to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| you simply don't make a motion and it dies for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| But historically we really haven't acted that way in city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| because some people want to take affirmative action to affirmatively not do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| which sounds a little strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| But that's what they've done, and we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| So when that happens, when you make a motion to deny, you flip those speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| and the speakers who speak first are the people who are in favor of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| So it would be the people who are opposed would speak first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| and those who are in favor would speak second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| And that's the no-news zone people, basically, the opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| I really don't know the basis for their opposition, but I would assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| So just to make sure, the people who have signed up to speak in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| they're still going to be the people who speak first under our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Okay, it's flipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| That's an interesting discussion because it's a great way to flip the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| But anyway, we'll discuss it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Then now the people who had previously signed up to speak against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| you're now speaking in favor of the motion to deny, I'm assuming, but maybe you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| Lauren Ryder would be first, and then Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3415)|
| 0:57:05| Lauren Ryder, 229 East Scott Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| If I know why I'm here to speak for or against, take a second and realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| You guys have heard a lot from me, and when I say me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| I'm not speaking here on the behalf of just myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| I am here on the behalf of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| I live in Old North Knoxville Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| It's actually one of the largest historic districts in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| So please don't feel that I'm only here on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| I'm also here on behalf of myself as a citizen of Knoxville as a city as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| and I'll get to that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| I speak on behalf of neighbors who live near or next to existing commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| They're gravely concerned about further creep of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| the possibility of houses across and next to them converting to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| Some of them may already live next to one commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| They don't want to themselves become a commercial building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| or have the houses across and neighboring them also become commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| I speak as a concerned citizen for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| I don't want you to think that I'm only looking at my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| I'm looking at the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| I have driven around a couple of example areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| I see this zoning as a means for cheap office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| that will be almost exclusive to areas of modest income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| The topic of R4 or MU1 has been discussed at great length for several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3504)|
| 0:58:31| The Neighborhood Advisory Council discussed this issue at several meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| under the direction of David Massey and Mark Donaldson as a guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| At the first Neighborhood Advisory Council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Mr. Donaldson gave out maps of areas that will be ideal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| in his opinion, for the use of this new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| I don't know if any of you had seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| They're places like Dutch Valley Road, Shasta Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Asheville Highway and Chilhowee, the center of Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| I really can't remember all of them off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| One other thing that he said was that how desirable it is to own a home next to a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| because you're gone to work during the day and they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| and then you come home at night and they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| We've heard speakers say before that that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| When they've allowed commercial uses to come in, surprisingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| they have full rounds of business going up until 10 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| So just because you let a commercial business come in next to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| don't assume that they're going to close up shop at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| I asked the Neighborhood Advisory Council when I got to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| how many of you actually choose to live next to a building, a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| How many of you live next to businesses rather than homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| Only one person at the table, including Massey and Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| raised their hand to say they live next to a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| I think as a general rule of thumb, we all know that most people don't go and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| I'd like to find a home next to a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| People do, and people choose those houses, but as a general rule of thumb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| we choose like houses next to our houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| The areas that he handed out and said would be great ideal areas for the R4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| based on previous requests to MPC for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| What I saw were modest income houses and instances where we would lose a whole street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| of modest income houses, like Shasta Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| I don't see anything wrong with those houses and the current existence of that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| I question whether we can afford to lose them as houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| What I see is areas where creating businesses will not make a walkable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| That was another example is that by turning all these houses into businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| we will create walkable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| In the instance of Shasta Drive, I see Cracker Barrel, Starbucks, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| at the end of the street, but I don't see a great way to cross the road to get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| There is already a business district to walk to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| You just can't get to it, so you don't need to create a greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| larger business district necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| I also see houses that are currently buffered from commercial zoning from other houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| that will become neighbors to commercial use if you take away those areas of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3671)|
| 1:01:21| The areas I visited also have a fair share of vacant commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| and I asked do we need to add more vacant commercial to areas of vacant commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| I remind you again that I live in an area that was written off as no longer desirable as housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| and everybody here knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| In post-World War II, people moved to the suburbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| and they decided they didn't want to live in the big Victorian houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| and when you chopped those up into units and you bulldozed some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| into concrete block businesses, then no one wanted to live in the craftsmen's next to them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| So they vacated the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| It became rife with prostitution, drugs, businesses, rent by the hour, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| Some of those houses that were rent by the hour are now $400,000 and more houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| and the area is considered desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| What I will say in closing is the neighborhoods revitalized from the inside out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| No one came and said I want to pick the house next to the gas station and pour a bunch of money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| Those were the last things to be renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| If you increase the commercial area and creep in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| you're going to make the houses that weren't next to commercial next to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| and make them less desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| So I'm not sure that we're going to gain anything by increasing commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| I do see areas that have issues in the areas that Mr. Donaldson pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| but I'm not sure that the solution that's been proposed, this one size fits all, is the correct solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| My name is Lynn Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| I'm here tonight representing the position of my Norwood Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| my neighborhood group on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| which is that we would like City Council to go ahead and take action tonight to do a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| and please vote to turn it down and let's end the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| I am also here with the permission of the following neighborhood groups representing their position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| which is similar or the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| Fountain City Town Hall, Bearden Council, Kingston Heights Sequoia Hills Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| West Hills Community Association, Westwood Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Forest Heights Homeowners, Sutherland Heights, Lions View Community, Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Tazewell Pikes, Beverly Acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| We all have the same concerns about this, and it's been an interesting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| We started out thinking we could do an improvement to the existing zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| It's become, in our opinion, and not just mine, but in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| the product that we have is not going to do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| Three concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| First of all, it allows office and multifamily to come into existing residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| And having lived in neighborhoods for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| some of the worst experiments we've ever done in my part of town are transition zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| They haven't worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| It's much better to draw a line and say this is residential, this is office on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| and not let it creep back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Shasta Drive, which now we're going to go deeper in there, is the ultimate example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| Many, many years ago, certainly before Councilman Becker was in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| there was a massive rezoning there and we, the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| have paid the price for many years because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| It doesn't protect in the ways that we hoped it would, but it does endanger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| You will still be able to do multifamily in what was formerly a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| You will be able to convert to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| And if I live next door to something that looks like an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| I'm going to get very little comfort saying to myself at night, well, it's not really office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| it's R4 or MU1 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| That makes no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| I'm living next door to an office and not what I had planned and what I had hoped for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| Houses can still be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| Lots can still be under this new zoning area, can be combined, or they can be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| So we're not gaining basic protection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| The critical technical thing that's wrong with this, it doesn't have serious design standards in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| We have something in there called development considerations, but they're a matter of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| If you look at the design standards for what we've done in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| the established neighborhood districts, they're very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| If I go down to MPC with a plan for an established neighborhood district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| I can look at the regulations and I can tell in a minute, will my plan work, will it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| With this new thing, it's going to be a matter of opinion, and everyone has an opinion, which is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| because you're going to get appeals from people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| I couldn't get these windows approved down at city council or, I mean, at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| How wide do you think my windows needs to be, members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Not all of us have architectural degrees up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| And council's time is better spent than doing things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| These are a few of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| These are a few of the neighborhoods around the city that do have these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| You are the brain surgeons of the city of Knoxville, and the first rule of being a doctor is do no harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| Please, let's end the process here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Mr. Redman, can I ask you just a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| You and Ms. Ryder both talked about Shasta, which was one of the places where the initial idea that this came for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| And I think you summed it up really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| Years ago, we rezoned, in effect, the north side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| It makes it the backside of Merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| There's a fellow there who across the street from him is a parking lot with no buffer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| And what I sort of heard from you is that is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| We all agree that that's not an ideal situation for a single-family residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| And what you're saying is this isn't the answer to that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| But do I hear you sort of saying we do need to figure an answer out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| Well, I guess what I'm saying is we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| It's wonderful to do positive things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| And many of the people that have worked on this and have very different opinions on the issue, we all hope something positive would come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4078)|
| 1:08:07| But if the danger is there and whether that's going to work, something like that's going to work for Shasta or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| You know, Shasta is a serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| It's going to creep and creep and creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| And, you know, we can't go back and redo what was done wrong many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| But I guess the other thing is let's don't keep doing it wrong and making it deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| All right, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Okay, there's – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Let me go ahead and ask Ms. Ryder as well what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| I wanted to clarify that I don't think there's anything wrong with Shasta Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| I see a few houses there that people haven't maybe kept up on improvements or maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| But if you go to the other end of Shasta Drive from Central Avenue Pike, I don't know what starts with an F maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| I just drove down it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I saw houses that people have put a great amount of investment into, brand-new renovations in those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| And I think that they would be shocked to wake up and find there's a nail salon around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| When they put all that money into their house, they thought that it was a strip of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| I saw a couple of houses that were facing the parking lot of not Paleo's but the Mexican restaurant maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| But there's certainly space there to put some trees, and therefore they wouldn't be looking at that parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| I mean, you have a nice street with wonderful trees that is a residential border to the houses behind them on Nueda Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4168)|
| 1:09:37| I'm not sure the people on Nueda Drive would be very happy to wake up and find they're now backed up to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| a nail salon, an insurance office, a pain clinic, on and on and on the list goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| I don't want to speak for those people, but I didn't see anything wrong with the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| What I do see is if we turn that all into businesses, we would be losing modest income, a whole street of modest income houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| And I'm not the expert on affordable housing, but I'm not so sure that's the right answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| Again, that would have been the argument in the 60s, 70s, and 80s about our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| No one wants to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Let's just turn it into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Let me move now to those speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| Excuse me, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Councilman Becker, is that the scenario that jump-started the whole conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| It's one of them, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| And it was Shasta and Dutch Valley that started sort of a move towards trying to do something on this, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| And something was framed as doing what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| The idea that was talked about is, and the house across in the parking lot might be an ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| The Dutch Valley one, I know Ms. Davis and I, I remember we fought about this years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| one on Dutch Valley, where you have a street that's primarily commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| has a lot of limits on when a family can get in there, but you want to maintain the structure of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| You want to make it look like a house to allow some other uses to come in without, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| the idea is not to stop the domino effect, to say, no, this house is going to continue to look like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| It's not going to be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| It's going to be a dentist's office, and it's going to look like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| So the idea was that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Now we're moving to those who are opposed, and it will be Terry Carruthers, then David Gartner, then Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4286)|
| 1:11:39| Dan Smith, I'm not sure under this scenario if you're signed up to speak in favor or against, so Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4299)|
| 1:11:49| Excuse me, and then Terry will come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| But, Dan, will you only speak in favor or against this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| I want to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| The motion is currently on us to deny, so you want to speak in opposition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Okay, go ahead, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| A lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Terry Carruthers, 6102 Arcadia Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| Tonight I'm here to represent SKNBC, the South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| that is comprised of the neighborhood associations of Colonial Village, Island Home Park, Lake Forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| Old Sevier, South Haven, South Woodlawn, Southside Riverfront, and Vestal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| as well as the Downtown South Business Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| We are new to the table on this matter, and we were one of the reasons that it was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| We wanted to have the opportunity to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| And we would like to commend the hard work of the Neighborhood Advisory Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| and Mark Donaldson and David Massey in the comprehensive review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| and recommended revisions to the original R4 proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| These individuals spent considerable time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| and their recommendations reflect the thoughtfulness with which they approached this task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| MU1 is exactly what we as neighborhoods need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| Without MU1, our neighborhoods have no protection, and encroachment will go unchecked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| This new zoning district will be a useful tool to transition between neighborhoods and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4403)|
| 1:13:31| Some fear MU1 would allow commercial development to creep into the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| but this new zoning does not allow commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| There will be no gas station. There will be no Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| That is not allowed under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| It permits only residential, office, and home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| Additionally, the structure must maintain the residential look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| It must remain compatible with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| If it burns down, they can't come in and put a concrete structure up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| They have to build a house that's going to look exactly or very similar to the house next door to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| the house across the street, the house down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Under MU1, you also have a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| Well done mixed use will only benefit neighborhoods rather than harm them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| The NAC worked with Mark Donaldson and public input to craft recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| that resolve the contentious issues initially proposed in R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| Their recommendations need to be recognized and passed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| They don't need to be tweaked at this stage, which would run the risk of weakening their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| You as council realize that you are not going to be able to please everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| but in passing MU1, you take a major step in protecting what citizens of Knoxville hold dearest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| The official representatives of SKNBC have reviewed these recommendations and they have our full support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| We respectfully request city council approve the MU1 recommendations and forward them to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| to make this a new classification for city zoning and protect us from commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| We will not have that commercial protection if MU1 does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| Thank you for your time, your consideration, and thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| David Gartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4538)|
| 1:15:50| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| I'm David Gartner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| I live at 207 Lake Forest Drive, and I'm here actually as president of COIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| Due to one of the scheduling glitches that can't occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| the Neighborhood Advisory Committee had their last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| and then went through a process of making sure everybody was in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| And COIN actually met between the Neighborhood Advisory Council meeting and when the report came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| So when we met, we didn't actually have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| So we couldn't actually have a proper up-and-down vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| However, after I took a look at our group, we've got about ten consistent members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| I'm trying to figure out whether to include Charlotte or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| Do I want to be included or excluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| I'll do it without Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| We have four people who are on the Neighborhood Advisory Council who are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| There have been two others of us that have been actively supporting R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| I contacted a couple of the others that weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| One is supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| One said they didn't know enough, and two, we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| So while we don't have a true vote, the majority of the Council of Involved Neighborhoods does support the R4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| and the Neighborhood Advisory Council recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| One of the things that people, again, said that causes me concern is that the process, to my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4636)|
| 1:17:26| to get something that is residential rezoned to O1 would be the same one, things you have to go through the MU4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| So I'll concede the point that they might get more support for going to an MU1 as opposed to an R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4654)|
| 1:17:44| but the process is the same, the same hoops, the same jumps, and the same people they're going to have to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| So I don't think that it will create that much additional threat of creep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Thank you, Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| I'm Stephanie Welch, 2137 Hillsborough Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| and I'm here actually as a member of the Island Home Park Neighborhood Association Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| and want to express our support for the R4 MU1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| which means that we are opposing the motion to deny the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| So we have a few reasons for supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| Many of them have already been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| We feel like it's important to actually create a barrier to prevent commercial encroachment on neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| and we felt like this would be a good tool for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| We're already on record as supporting mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| We supported the form-based code, which is mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| which basically just backs right up to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| So we're on record as supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| We continue to support that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| We had quite a bit of discussion at our board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| We actually reviewed the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| We reviewed the Neighborhood Advisory Committee's report to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| and we had some discussion about how important we felt it was to create neighborhoods that are walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| bikeable, that you don't have to get in your car and drive everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| We like that idea as a neighborhood and feel like that supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Just in closing, we would like to just recognize the work of the Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| Nine hours of meetings, countless hours, I'm sure, of discussion and negotiations outside those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| and I know this process has been going on for, you know, years, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| So I think it's important to acknowledge that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| acknowledge the work of the Metropolitan Planning Commission in working with the Neighborhood Advisory Council on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| We really do hope that you consider this proposal, the proposed ordinance, R4, MU1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| and the Neighborhood Advisory Council's recommendations to be incorporated into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| We support both of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4813)|
| 1:20:22| Daniel Smith, 7108 Lawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| That is four speakers, council, and would you all like to have him speak or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Suspend the rules and let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Although there is a chance to say, do I want Dan Smith to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Dan, the rules, as you know, are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Typically, council has to suspend that, but we'd ask for you to be very brief because we are allowing one extra speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4841)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Special thanks to you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| Where was I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| 7108 Lawford Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| Unfortunately for you all, I didn't have any prepared notes because I never thought you would get to such a thing as a motion to deny this in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4862)|
| 1:21:15| I'm not beholden to anybody, and I'm not speaking for anybody but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| If you deny it, you are postponing the inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| This plan is forward-looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| I know some of you have bothered to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Some of you actually came to the NAC meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| It is forward-looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| It is not catch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| It is not reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| It is extremely well thought out by the MPC, and it has been extremely due-diligenced, or whatever the right word is, by members of the NAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4902)|
| 1:21:54| Parenthetically, I would add that having spent all this time being a member of the NAC on this, it has disabused any thought I may have ever had about running for elected office on city council because you have to do this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4914)|
| 1:22:12| We will be better off with this than without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| It puts up flags where there weren't any flags, and if you look at all the uses on review requirements, you'll see what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4939)|
| 1:22:33| It is not wishy-washy in terms of what it requires and the kind of professional oversight it requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4953)|
| 1:22:42| In the end, whatever you do, you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| If MU4 is allowed to move forward, council can still do whatever council wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4968)|
| 1:22:56| And I can cite examples of things that maybe you shouldn't have done or maybe you should have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| But to deny it is what I would personally be surprised at, however many of you would be in the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4982)|
| 1:23:15| Thank you very much for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Thank you for being brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Let's see, either Lynn or Lauren, if either one of you have a two-minute chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=4999)|
| 1:23:29| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| We've talked this issue to death for many, many months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| Obviously in this town we have a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| Again, I would ask you to be very, very conservative in something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| I don't raise up the boogeyman too often, and I'm not trying to do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| But I think there are real weaknesses in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Let's say I have an R4 piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| It's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| I go down and pull a building permit for a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| There are no requirements, no restrictions, just whatever the residential restrictions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| I build a house that's a strange-looking house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| While it looks like a modern office, but there are no restrictions against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| I lived there six months under R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| I can convert it to an office without any regulations or restrictions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| There are enough concerns not only to drive that office and house through, but also a 12-plex through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| Again, we ask you, first of all, do no harm, and please let's end the process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Yeah, two things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| I think, Lynn, I'm glad you actually raised that concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I think there actually is a way to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| and it's one of the things that I think this process has been impressive of how many of the holes in it are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| I mean, I think the solution we say on that is house has to have existed for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| So you actually can't get by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| I want to do something real quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| This came up, I guess, 8 or 12 weeks ago, the last time it came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| and we had a fairly long discussion about referring this to the Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| I think most of us were skeptical that they could handle what we were giving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| I think we sort of expected something would come back that said this is a really tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| We actually got a very impressive amount of work out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| We got a recommendation that I think we can deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| and I just want to take a second to thank the members of the Neighborhood Advisory Council that worked on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| and I know a lot of them are here, and I'd like to ask all of them and the staff to just stand up and take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| I think they deserve a round of applause, because they've worked very hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| All right, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| I'll make the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| I actually am going to vote against Mr. DellaVope's motion to kill this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| And I think there's an interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| Jim Blattner has said a couple times, and I love this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| He says that with R4, and he said it was still called R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| some houses that are currently zoned O1 will get zoned R4 instead, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5171)|
| 1:26:18| But some houses that currently remain R1 will end up getting zoned R4, and that's a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| And I think that's in a way a really good summation of the issue, that at some level the fear some people see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| is that there will be more bad, the hope some people see is there will be more good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| I believe there will be more good, because I think that this council knows how to use tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| which is what this is, to accomplish a good goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| And I think the challenge with a place like Shasta is that right now the options we have for dealing with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5206)|
| 1:26:54| are very limited, and they are an office zone or a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| And I'd love to, I'd actually love, Lynn made the point of we can't go back and fix what was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| I'd love to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| There's some significant problems on that road on the north side of it as it backs up to merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5226)|
| 1:27:15| My sense is that's a road that's going downhill if we don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| And it goes because people who own property there, they're across the street from a parking lot that doesn't have any trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| that has no blocking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| I mean, it's a straight shot out to merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| All that has to happen is for this council to make a mistake once and zone something there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| a commercial or office, and that domino is falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| This, I think, gives us an option to allow those houses to remain as houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| to remain in a look that's proper for that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| without becoming eyesores on the rest of the neighborhood, without becoming gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| So I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| So I'm going to oppose Mr. Delevaux's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Right now the motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| I have a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| I have received some phone calls and e-mails from people who live on Moody Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| and that will be a main thoroughfare with the Henley Street Bridge closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| They're very concerned that the R4MU1 will be something that will slide into their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| and they're not happy about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| The other thing in the third district parallel to Clinton Highway is a street called Marguerite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| and on Marguerite is a building that would look like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| It's a center that people rent out for private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| The people who live on Orchid, which is parallel to Marguerite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| I hear from them every weekend about the noise, the increased traffic, the noise from the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5332)|
| 1:29:01| When the center went in for the private parties, they were not opposed because it never occurred to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| there would be this increased traffic or this creep of noise that goes into their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| and disturbs their peace of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| So I'm going to be supporting Councilman De La Vope's motion to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| because I think that is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| What we're looking at is R4, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| That's what's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| MU1 is not on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| What I want to have clarification on is that Mr. Massey sent us the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| Neighborhood Low Intensity Office Professional Zoning District package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| which has recommendations such as a couple of concerns I have, which is parking in the front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| also the size of signage, which is in this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| And I guess what I need is clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| To the recommendation, is it in the new R4, MU1, or is this still considered just a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5404)|
| 1:30:12| First of all, that's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Let me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Sorry, I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Yeah, I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| You missed my talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| I missed your talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| We were handed a packet of information from David Massey concerning the work that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Neighborhood Advisory Committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| And in that is proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| For instance, it says highlights in blue indicate language that should be removed if NAC proposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5438)|
| 1:30:46| absolutely no front yard parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| And so if you go through this document, you'll see that front yard parking was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| There's also information in here about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| And then there's also information in here about other development considerations, which are done in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| And so the question I have is if what's on the table right now is just strictly the R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5462)|
| 1:31:09| then where is the recommendations that these folks came up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| What's on the table right now is strictly R4 that comes to you from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| What Mr. Becker, I think, is proposing to you is that I take the memorandum from NAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| and do my best to incorporate the proposed recommendations through that work into that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5484)|
| 1:31:33| and bring that back to you to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| I think that's what he's proposing as a method to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| But it's not there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| He's proposing a postponement to allow me to go do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| So are we looking to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| That's what Mr. Becker wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Mr. DellaVolpe wants to just kill it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| If we do not choose to kill this tonight, I will make a motion to postpone so Charles can draft up that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| What's interesting to me is the number of people who are saying no matter what's in the language, this won't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| that the concept's a bad concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Ideally, well, ideally, actually we did actually vote when we adopted the North City Sector Plan in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| We actually did sort of informally ask MPC to develop this because this was in there as something that should be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| It's a little bit, Dwayne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| if you remember the discussion you and I had last week about your resolution we just adopted on a new zoning code for the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5555)|
| 1:32:46| That train was going someplace when it left the station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| I'm not sure where that was now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| But in 2007, we weren't clear with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| We weren't clear with ourselves about what we were asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| We said as part of the plan, yeah, you know, paragraph 27 on page 162, this is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5577)|
| 1:33:05| We didn't talk about it, which would have been great at the time except that a majority of us wouldn't be here now anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5585)|
| 1:33:13| So what we've got is a segment out there that says no matter what the language is, a concept like O4, R4, MU1 is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5593)|
| 1:33:26| I think that the language, the work that the Neighborhood Advisory Council is very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| And I'd like to say to Mr. Swanson, draft this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| But if there are five people here who are saying no matter what the language is, we're against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| we don't need to spend Mr. Swanson's time working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| So I'm actually in a way glad that Mr. De La Vope made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| Because it says are there five votes for this in some form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| Is there enough hope in what the Advisory Council came up with that we should keep moving forward or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5634)|
| 1:34:01| I think there's some interesting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| The Advisory Council didn't bring up the question Mr. Redman did, which I think is a really good question to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| I don't think it's that difficult to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| I think that once we get the Neighborhood Advisory Council, we still need to dig in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| Because there are going to be loose ends in talking to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| There are a couple different ways the language for some of these things can be drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| And we're going to have to make the call on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| So at some point, what I'm hoping is actually we make a decision to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| But I want that to be a clear decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| I don't want us to spend a whole lot of time and energy and then come down to the end and say, well, we were against it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| So that's what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| But technically what Mr. DellaVoppe's motion to vote on to deny is what came out of MPC and I guess is what's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5683)|
| 1:34:54| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Well, part of my frustration is that, for instance, the Neighborhood Advisory Committee came back with no parking in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| They came back with design requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| Also came back with information about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| And if I'm not mistaken, it seems like a year or so ago we were talking about no parking in the front yard, signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| and those three very basic issues, which at that time we had talked to MPC about and we've made no headway with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| I'm not convinced that our council, who comes up with the same information sending it to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| is going to make any changes to what we've looked at for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| So I just have a problem, I think, philosophically with the whole idea, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| And I think I'd be interested to see the folks out there that feel the same way, philosophically for and philosophically against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5740)|
| 1:35:48| But where I see the frustration is that it seems like that, number one, we have the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| which are our experts, which we're paying, and we've gone through several renditions of neighborhood groups getting involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5754)|
| 1:36:03| And MPC comes back with the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| So that's where my frustration is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I won't be long, I promise, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| I think, one, there actually have been a lot of changes in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| You know, I actually was at, like I said, the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| I think, Mark, this actually started at that meeting we had up at Sturkey School where we met outside for a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| because the janitor had to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| And that was early 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| And, frankly, there's been a lot of changes in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| One of the frustrations a lot of the people who have been involved in this have is it keeps changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| I talked to somebody last night, and I said, no, it's not R4 anymore, it's MU1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| And I got an earful over another change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| So a lot's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| And, interestingly, it's changed on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| neighborhood people said, let's make everything a use on review as a way to get a better control of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5813)|
| 1:37:01| Eventually, as they thought about that, they said, no, that doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| So three years' time, people have a lot of thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| I don't think, I don't want to send this back to MPC without real clear language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| I want Mr. Swanson to write up language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| I want us to vote on what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| I think the only reason it goes back to MPC is the state says they have to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| So I think we tell MPC what we want because we're the people that decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| They only make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| And we get a recommendation from them because the state requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| So I'm not suggesting we ask MPC for any more expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Three years, we've gotten everything in the brain of MPC on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| So that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Councilman Rodney, I'll come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I guess I'm sitting here thinking that I wish that we had had this discussion the last time this was on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5867)|
| 1:37:55| What I'm hearing my colleagues saying is that out of respect for Mr. Swanson's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| we shouldn't send this to him unless it's a real consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| Otherwise, let's just kill it, call it dead, and be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| Well, I think out of consideration for the nine hours that the members of the Neighborhood Advisory Council spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| if that was going to be the discussion, that should have been had before we sent this to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| and asked them to spend nine hours doing something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| It feels incredibly disrespectful to me to now say, well, let's just kill it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5902)|
| 1:38:30| because as Mr. Grave pointed out, the document that's in front of us is still R4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| and doesn't incorporate any of the suggestions that the Neighborhood Advisory Council hammered out after nine hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| to mold this into MU1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Now, MU1 is a separate discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Maybe what they hammered out after nine hours still doesn't have five votes on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| But as Mr. Grave pointed out, that document has not been melded into this document and merged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5930)|
| 1:39:02| It hasn't been merged into this document yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| And so if we were going to shut this down and declare a debt on arrival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| I feel like that should have happened the last time this came to our table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| before we asked some very involved citizens to spend nine hours on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| I just want to call for the question if we can do it before we have discussions about what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| that might deal with if we don't deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| That does take precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| We'll find out if we're going to deny it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| That does take precedence as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| I'm hearing no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| We're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| Well, I'm going to agree with Councilman Grave that, you know, I have some issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| No matter what we call it, it's going to be a business next to a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| Potentially it could be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| And, you know, even though I know the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| South Bronx Business and Neighborhood Coalition is, you know, is in support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| and now I'm hearing today or yesterday, I guess, that Island Home Board had voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| But still, you know, once it started getting out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| then I started getting the calls from people that really weren't informed enough about this for me to get in behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6010)|
| 1:40:21| Because, you know, once it goes in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| then I know that I'll be the one that was looked at and said, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| you didn't protect, you know, my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| It was the first line of defense, and then the people in behind that, and it just keeps going, going, going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| So if I'm going to err, and we all ran, if I remember right, that we were neighborhood people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| and if I'm going to err, I'm going to make a conservative mistake here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| and say that perhaps it can come back, you know, in a different form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| But as it is, I'm just not comfortable with it, and I won't support it as it's presented tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6055)|
| 1:41:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Actually, Councilman Brown hasn't spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| I'm going to go to Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Well, I think that we need to go ahead and vote on the R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| This has gone on now, in my understanding, about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| We've heard the recommendation from the neighborhood group and neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| And I think we can deal with the MU1 separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| But I think it would be wise for us to go ahead and vote on the R4 tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| because three years is a long time to deal with this issue, and we've gotten feedback from many sources already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6095)|
| 1:41:43| I think we should go and make a decision on that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Yeah, I just want to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Number one, I certainly appreciate what the Neighborhood Advisory Committee has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| but I also think that even though they've spent nine hours in the last three or four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| there's groups of people out there who have spent three years working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| And I just want that to kind of be on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| that those people have spent countless hours working on it in terms of trying to come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| So they deserve credit also, as well as all the neighborhood groups that have tried to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| I guess, Ms. Roddy, I sort of agree with you that it's a shame to say tonight we've got to vote yes-no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6137)|
| 1:42:25| I will point out, I actually suggested somebody make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| I wasn't going to make it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| But the other thing is, I understand that Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| but if somebody felt like they would rather have the language that has come out of the Neighborhood Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6153)|
| 1:42:43| a motion to postpone to allow Mr. Swanson to draft that language would take precedent over the motion to deny, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6163)|
| 1:42:52| A motion to postpone will take precedence, whatever the purpose the motion to postpone may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| A motion to postpone is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| I also have a question for Mr. Swanson, and that is, is MU1 codependent on R4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6184)|
| 1:43:13| In other words, if this council chooses to support the motion to deny and kills R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6193)|
| 1:43:21| then is MU1 still a live proposal starting back with MPC and going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| or is the MU1 iteration dependent upon those recommendations being merged in as revisions to the R4 that we have in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6208)|
| 1:43:39| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| In my opinion, if you support the motion to deny, this process is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| which is not to say that it can't be started again, calling it MU1 and starting with a whole new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6227)|
| 1:43:55| But this process will be over tonight if you support the motion that is currently on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Yeah, I was under the impression that the recommendations that came out of the Neighborhood Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| the renaming was really just that was a name only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| but that their recommendations were kind of codependent with this R4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| and that we had to keep R4 alive for the MU1 recommendations that they came up with to have a future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6256)|
| 1:44:23| Yeah, I think that's what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| I heard you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| But you could start the whole process again, calling it MU1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| If this motion passes, you start again with the MPC process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| and the MPC can consider an MU1 and whatever provisions you want to put in that MU1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| and then bring that forward to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| This doesn't say that the zoning code is frozen at that moment forevermore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| But it essentially would lay to rest the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| or the recommendations that the Neighborhood Advisory Council came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| in that you're starting back again at go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| whereas if you keep R4 alive with the potential of being revised as an MU1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| you're further down the path, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| I think you've got it figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| My concern from me, from my chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| is being respectful of the time that we asked some citizens to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| the last time we considered this eight weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| Whether or not ultimately it passes this council or not remains to be seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| but there was a tremendous amount of time and angst and blood, sweat, and tears put into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| and if we were going to shut down R4 at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| then I feel like we should have done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| and, therefore, we asked that citizen group to contribute all that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Well, again, I think that it's time to put it to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| We have had a dozen or more neighborhoods that worked with MPC for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| when they came up with recommendations like no parking in the front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| like small signs, like monument signs only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| Those issues were repeatedly rejected by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| as not in keeping with their idea of what this zone should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| We had a workshop where council attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| and we had neighborhood after neighborhood leader come up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| there's more harm than good, and I think it's time to put it to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| If someone later wants to come up with a form-based code and call it MU1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| we'll deal with that at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| but I think in respect to all those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| who have put their sweat and tears in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| I think that's an important consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Secondly, I do think the Neighborhood Advisory Council did a nice job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| but they actually incorporated some of the same recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| that have been rejected repeatedly by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| and I think we're back to this situation where it's time to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| no, this is not what we need, the demand is not that great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| and the harm seems to be something we shouldn't tolerate to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| and I'm asking you to vote to deny it and put an end to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| The fact that we decided to postpone and give it a second shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| nice, too bad we did it, but we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| So let's just move on to the question of getting this thing off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| It's a motion to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| That takes precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| There's no discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| We're going to go ahead and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| All those in favor of calling the question, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| Wait, the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Is the question to vote to approve R4 or to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| No, the motion is to vote to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| So we're voting right now that you want to go ahead and cut off discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| vote on whether or not to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| That's the vote, yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| So all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| We better do a roll call real quick, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6475)|

| 1:48:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| Okay, so the motion to call the question is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Now we're going to go straight to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| The motion on the floor is to deny, and that's what we'll be voting on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6505)|

| 1:48:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| Okay, the motion to deny passes six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| Okay, the motion is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| 12B is an ordinance to rezone property located within certain public parks from various zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| to OS1 Open Space Preservation District Metropolitan Planning Commission applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| There's only one person signed up to speak right now on this, and Mr. McAdams has signed up as both for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6545)|
| 1:49:14| You can speak for a total of five minutes, three times on each side, and then you'll have two minutes to rebut yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6554)|
| 1:49:23| I personally want to hear your rebuttal against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6563)|
| 1:49:31| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6571)|

| 1:49:36| Like the others, I'm not here on behalf of anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| My wife has authorized me to say she agrees with me on this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| This started out as what I thought was a relatively simple matter, and it's now gone on for about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| And it's another one of those that I hope you will deal with tonight, and that is it's about protection for city parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6593)|
| 1:50:02| and it's about what the process should be if you want to change the use of a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6602)|
| 1:50:10| If you wanted to build a racetrack in a city park, or if you wanted to build a nursing home in a city park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6610)|
| 1:50:17| or if you wanted to build an apartment complex or a lodge hall in a city park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| what process should you go through and what public input do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| That's the question that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| Right now, city parks are in a variety of zones, and the original proposal was to ask MPC to study this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6629)|
| 1:50:37| come back with a recommendation on putting city parks in an OS1 zone so that there would be a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6637)|
| 1:50:45| And what that means is it doesn't stop you from doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| You can always rezone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| What it does is it ensures that any change in the use of a public park would have the most open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| transparent process known to city government, and that is the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| In rezoning, the property is posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| There is a notice published in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| It goes through a professional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| It goes to the MPC Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| It comes to you after more publication and more posting of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| and it has to be passed by you at two hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| That is the most open, most transparent, most firmly established process for public input that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6683)|
| 1:51:32| And what I say to you is the parks deserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| They deserve to go through that process if you want to change your use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| If you want it, parks are one of the most important things that the city has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| They're probably the second most utilized city resource behind garbage pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| But they're the ones that tens of thousands of people use on a daily basis all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| So how do you go about doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| And the answer is for the last 30 years, the OS1 zoning ordinance has been the official zone for city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6718)|
| 1:52:07| 18 parks, 17 included in the materials that I've given to you, to the OS1 zone every time with MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6727)|
| 1:52:17| Every time MPC has looked at this and said, what do you put a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| And the answer is the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| It's the only zone where a park is permitted as a permitted use as opposed to a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| It is the official zone for parks and playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| And so the simple thing to do is to put the parks in the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| Seventeen of them are, put the rest of them in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| And that's what went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| And what comes back is a recommendation that a handful of parks get protected, but not the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| And suddenly they say, wait a minute, there's a maximum lot coverage limitation that applies, so you shouldn't apply it to parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| You've applied it to parks for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| You've applied it to parks 17 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| Multiple mayors, multiple city councils, multiple law directors, multiple MPC directors have all said this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6786)|
| 1:53:16| It's not just for big parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| MPC says it's only for big parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| No, you've put seven acre parks in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| You've put 150 acre parks in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| You've put large parks, medium parks, small parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| They say, well, it's for parks that are mostly woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| It's not for parks that are ball fields and recreation facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| You've put ball fields in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| You've put recreational facilities in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| You put the NSKIP ball fields in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| You put the Rocky Hill ball fields in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Every time you've wanted to protect a park, you've put it in the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| And what I'm asking you to do, what I urge you to do, is protect the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| Put them all in the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| And if you decide that there is some better use, some better use than public recreation for that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| then go through the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| Have the hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Invite the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Put up a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Right now there are parks that are exposed to all sorts of things that could happen at either one hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| or at either a city council hearing or some of them at an MPC hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| Badgett Fields are in A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| Northwest Middle School Park, A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| Alice Bell, Fountain City, Gary Underwood, all in R1, along with six others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| Lakeshore is in O2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| William Hastie Park, you can build assisted living facilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| Commercial and office, since it's bigger than 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| Churches, private day nurseries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| Isn't the public entitled to some input on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| Aren't they entitled to know, hey, we're going to take away your park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| So all that you have to do to do that is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Amend the ordinance that is before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| Amend it to include all of the parks that you originally asked MPC to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6897)|
| 1:55:04| That does not include Log Haven, which isn't a city park at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| It's a beautiful piece of property, but you don't own it, and you didn't ask MPC to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| So just ask them to put back in the list that you sent them six months ago in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| and ask them to look at it and say, let's rezone all these parks to the OS1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| And that, on second reading, will immediately provide that level of protection that if somebody wants to change the use of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6923)|
| 1:55:32| be open about it, be public about it, tell the public, have the hearings, and let the people talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| Now, you've passed tonight a resolution requesting that MPC consider amendments to the OS1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| and that's certainly appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| But that could take months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| That could take years, as you've seen from other zoning processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| Voting tonight to amend this ordinance and then approve it will include all the parks and protect them in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6953)|
| 1:56:00| And if when they come back it seems they identify some parks that would be better in another zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| well, you can rezone them at that time, but they've been protected in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| So I'm for it and I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| I am not in favor of the ordinance as it appears before you because it only provides protection to a handful of parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| So I would urge you to amend that ordinance, add the list, delete that list, which includes things that aren't city parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6979)|
| 1:56:27| replace it with the list that does include all the city parks that you ask MPC to review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| and approve that motion rezoning all the city parks to OS1 to ensure a public transparent process if someone wants to change the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=6993)|
| 1:56:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| The councilor took away part of my speech, so I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| What I'd like to do is to amend the motion to include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| I've got a list of 19 parks that are five acres or larger that range anywhere from A1 to R1 to O2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7019)|
| 1:57:07| I'd like to have those included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| And then we want to, in the motion, take out the Log Haven and the River Bluff Wildlife Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7029)|
| 1:57:19| And what are the 19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| The 19, I think you were handed a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| Is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| Is the City of Knoxville Unprotected Parks five acres or larger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| Were they handed this, Councilor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| It doesn't have a caption on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| It has a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| I think my suggestion is actually more than 19 parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| That's just the ones that are five acres or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| Attached to your original resolution, which was in your MPC recommendation package, is a list of many, many more city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7064)|
| 1:57:53| All the city parks are on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| And my suggestion is you rezone all the city parks that were in your original resolution, not just the ones that were in your original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7077)|
| 1:58:04| Is that the Exhibit A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| That's Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| The one-page, two-column listing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| The ones that I just mentioned were five acres or more, and I'll change that to say that all the city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| As listed in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| Something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| I did have a question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| If Mr. McAdams could come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| I did want to ask him, I guess eventually this will find its way back to MPC to look at this or to apply it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7111)|
| 1:58:40| What do you say about this passive versus active park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| I've already heard you say that the practical construction, if I can use a legal term, of this ordinance is that for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| we've treated it as any park fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| And I guess my question to you is, do we have to tinker with that dimensional requirement issue or simply just apply OS1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7134)|
| 1:59:03| which protects open space in any flavor, at least by practical construction of 30 years of actual use of this zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7143)|
| 1:59:13| I don't think that you need to make any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| I think you can tonight rezone every park without making a single change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| I think if you decide down the road that you want to do that, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| But the existing ordinance says permitted uses, park and recreation uses, including parks, playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| golf courses, cycling, hiking, equestrian trails, parkways, country clubs, excluding buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| hunting preserves, camps and resorts, fishing lakes, scenic routes, wild and scenic rivers and streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| So general park uses of all sorts are already permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| I don't think you need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| So you're saying take the list and put it in OS1, and if someone wants to tinker, we'll deal with it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| If they say, no, you can't change that because of some limitation in the zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| then that particular park you might want to take a look at the zoning of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| But right now I can't think of a single use that it would not stop any use at any park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| because they would all be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| And if somebody wanted to change a use at a park, I believe in most of them, every use I can think of would fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7211)|
| 2:00:17| And you're saying that that change would end up being the public process that you advocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| that gets public notice, that gets hearings, that gets a transparent determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| Do you want to go to Mr. Becker next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| I guess I'm a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| And, Mr. Delveppe, it's kind of a follow-up on your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| What my concern would be is the maximum lot coverage that's in OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| I actually, you know, Mr. McAdams, I know you and I barked at each other at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| but you actually had a point that was well said in the handout that you gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| and what you said here, that at some level the zoning gets the black sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| It gets the public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| It gets the process, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| I'm a little concerned about zoning, let's say Larry Cox Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| into something that says no more than 5% of the field, the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| can have any kind of structure or man-made anything because the park is 100% ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7273)|
| 2:01:20| And we fall into there this challenge of saying, oh, well, we're going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| but we're not going to follow our own zoning code, which is a little scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| So I'd almost think, and I would point out that Mr. McAdams is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| For 30 years now we've been randomly zoning parks, different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| and there are parks where you're allowed to have apartment buildings and skyscrapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| I wouldn't be surprised, and yet there aren't any skyscrapers or apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| We have succeeded in keeping our parks protected with the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| I'd actually prefer keeping the list at what MPC has suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| and following up on the other resolution that we passed earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| to get Mr. DellaVope at what you're at is an active park use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| because I think we fall into the trap if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| So to this, oh, yeah, we're zoning all the parks one way, but wink, wink, nod, nod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| we're not following our zoning code because it doesn't apply to most of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| And I think that's a little bit of a dangerous way to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| because it points out that wink, wink, nod, nod, we don't need to follow our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| and that's a bad precedent to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Number one, I think that it's been pretty well proven how long it takes something to get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| both through MPC and to change, and so really what we're asking is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| and by the way, if we take Exhibit A, which is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| it has the parks that they mentioned in the resolution, so we could just include Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7363)|
| 2:02:49| But what we're actually doing is we're asking that these parks be protected immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| and that then the other resolution can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| You know, for instance, the lot coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| I could argue over the fact of what the lot coverage says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| It says seated areas, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| Well, you know, a lot of ball fields are seated in the outer areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| And when you go back and you look at the history of what parks that have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| you know, when you look at Inskip Ball Fields, 9.6 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| Alice Bell Park and Ball Fields, 12.1 acres, Skyline Park, 9.6 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| you go back and granted that maybe this should not have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| but what we can do is at least we'll know that we can protect these parks immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| by putting them under the OS1, and then with the other resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| MPC can go and either correct it or come up with a new zoning that these parks can go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| At least now, today, we will know that these parks are protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| That's what I'm personally looking forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| Councilman Grieve, you've done a lot of research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| All of the parks on that Exhibit A list, is that a complete list of all of them to your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7438)|
| 2:04:07| To my knowledge, I believe it is, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| This also includes the ones that are in the resolution also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| So this would be the parks that we would present with the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| Sorry, Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| Yeah, let me address your comment, which is should we have the wink-wink approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7462)|
| 2:04:29| or the practical construction that we've done in the past that was in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| I mean, if the other option is to simply say, along with adding Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| is to take B3 of OS1, where it describes parks and recreations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| and put a sentence or a clause that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| such parks shall be included notwithstanding any of the dimensional requirements set out in D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| Say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| We could just put a clause where it says B3 and it says parks and recreation uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| We could just put a clause or a sentence at the end of that line that describes the various kinds of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| and says that parks shall not be subject to the D, subsection D area regulations that has the setbacks and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7505)|
| 2:05:15| I'm confused about where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| Where are you at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| Oh, I was looking at OS1 in the zoning code and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| if your concern is that it looks like there might be some inconsistency and that troubles you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7522)|
| 2:05:29| you could, in essence, move that we simply clarify B3 by just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| parks shall not be subject to the area setback blah, blah, blah restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| I have to point out you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| You can't amend the zoning code here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| You've got to start somewhere else, which is MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| You can't amend the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| Even though they made a recommendation and we're acting on it, we can't go beyond their recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| What we have as a vehicle to do this is an ordinance that changes the zoning of a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7557)|
| 2:06:08| We don't have a vehicle that is a change of a provision of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| And that's the kind of vehicle you've got to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| So we have the two-step dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| We could put the parks in and use the resolution that you helped draft that says MPC, make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7575)|
| 2:06:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| We have a resolution we've already passed this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| There's a resolution that you passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| It said either work it in OS1 or make a public park subsection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| But it's got to go back to MPC before it ever becomes effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| So are you saying we cannot adopt Exhibit A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| No, I'm not saying that because that, this is a vehicle for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| We can agree or disagree as to whether or not those parks belong in that zoning category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| That was a proper vehicle for changing the zoning for specific pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| Because we gave that to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| It's not a proper vehicle for changing an overall provision of the zoning code as OS1 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| I understand you're saying the process has to be different for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| So never mind my fix to your suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7640)|
| 2:07:21| I just want to point out once again that both the two parks that, now I've got to look them up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| Log Haven and what was the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| Log Haven and River Bluff are not on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| They actually were deleted two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| And they were not part of Exhibit A anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Ms. Roddy and Mr. Is that your light still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7669)|
| 2:07:50| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| The language that's in front of us, page four of the ordinance that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| as amended, shows on the last page you do not see Log Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| That was the amendment that I offered when we met two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| However, I did not offer an amendment to delete the River Bluff wildlife area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7685)|
| 2:08:11| So if Mr. Greave, I don't know in the priority of motions here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| if he wants to offer to amend that to delete the other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| He talked about making a motion to delete Log Haven and River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| We already deleted Log Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| River Bluff is still in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| If you want to bring that to the floor to discussion as to the wisdom of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| deleting River Bluff, we can talk about that separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| While I have the floor, I agree with Vice Mayor Becker that I think it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7714)|
| 2:08:41| First of all, I want to protect the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| I hope all of us here want to find the right vehicle to protect our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| I hope that's a given with this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| However, it's how we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| And I think that we have a zoning code that's very specific about what is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7733)|
| 2:08:59| and not appropriate, and I can't find a reason to support an amendment of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| to add all these other parks when we can see very clearly that they don't fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| within the definition of Open Space 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| We passed a resolution tonight asking that MPC come up with a different designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| for those other parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| We've seen another city in this state accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| I think just because something else on our agenda tonight took three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| doesn't imply that this is going to take three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| We can get it two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| So I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| I think the level of protection that we have in our parks has been sufficient up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| I don't sense an imminent threat, and I cannot support putting these parks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7774)|
| 2:09:41| Open Space 1 when it clearly states that's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| I think for clarification, I think River Bluff is not a city-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| It's not a city-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| Is the Parks Department here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| Ms. Rowdy, do you know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| I am vice chair of the Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| We undertook a fundraising drive in the past year to purchase the River Bluff property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| from a private developer who was unable to develop that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| The intent when the mortgage or the loan that was taken out, we have multi-year pledges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| So we have raised the money to purchase the property, but because it's being paid in multi-year pledges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| we had to take out a loan to cover that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| When the property is fully purchased and owned by Legacy Parks Foundation, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| we will then transfer it to the city, and the city, I believe, Ms. Poplin, is in on that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| and anticipates taking that on as one of our park assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| However, we don't want to transfer to the city a piece of property that has debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| But it's not part of the city now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| No, but I would say that Legacy Parks Foundation is fine with being included in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| and that the intent is that that is open space, not well-developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| and we see in the description of open space that it is potential uses for private as well as public lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7863)|
| 2:11:11| The River Bluff property would be sort of that exception, that it's still a piece of private land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| but the owners of that who is currently the Legacy Parks Foundation is fine with this designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| They would ask that I believe that it not be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| We recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| Ms. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| Thank you, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| I'm not advocating one way or the other here, but I did have a piece of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| and Councilmember Roddy just said what I was going to say, but since I'm standing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| I did talk to Carol Evans at Legacy Parks today about this whole park thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| and she did state to me that they were fine with the River Bluff area being rezoned OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7909)|
| 2:11:56| So that's what I know, and I'll just share it with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Well, actually, Ms. Palmer, could I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| Because the city recorder and I are completely in agreement on what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7927)|
| 2:12:12| As the motion was originally stated, was it to take out River Bluff and Log Haven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7932)|
| 2:12:20| or was that part of your original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| I kind of thought it was, and she kind of thought it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| We're taking out Log Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Well, it's already out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| Okay, but it's in this sheet of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| No, not in the operative section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| But then River Bluff would be taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| But they just said they don't want River Bluff taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| So is that still your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| Leave it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| River Bluff stays in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| River Bluff stays in, but it is not an Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| Excuse me, Ms. Palmer, I just needed to clarify what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| I was going to suggest, since we have some understanding, misunderstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| discussion on the status of River Bluff, perhaps we should wait until the city actually owns the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7979)|
| 2:13:06| before we add it to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| And that way we would not be putting in something that is really not the city's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7988)|
| 2:13:14| Let me, I guess just my thought would be zoning usually applies to other people's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=7994)|
| 2:13:21| and we put it on to manage the growth to have some influence on saying it's a public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| So, I mean, actually, once we own it, we as a council actually would have to vote to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| If we don't zone it properly, anybody can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| I want to be clear before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Your motion, I have, no, I don't have the paper copy in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| I have the electronic version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| I have the list on the electronic version, which has page four of your resolution from April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8035)|
| 2:14:03| It's a list that has two columns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| What your motion is, and I just want to be clear on this, is to take that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| and it always takes a little while to go back and forth on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| and to replace the list in section one, number one, approve OS1, open space preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8056)|
| 2:14:28| zoning for the following parks, and to put your list there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| and to keep the River Bluff Wildlife Area here because it's not on your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| Take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| Are the others all in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| Does everybody understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| Well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| The ones that are on here are listed in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| So we're taking Exhibit A and putting it into item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| But we are keeping River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| Keeping River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| Is that clear to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| Are there other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| Let's try a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| All those in favor of Mr. Greave's motion to amend this, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8108)|
| 2:15:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| Let's do a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| I heard maybe three, maybe four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| Let's do a voice vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| Councilman Greave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| So 6-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| That is adopted 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| That was just the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| Yes, that was the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| In cross-referencing this list, this Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| that just passed as the substitute list under Section 1, Number 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| we said that it would be Exhibit A plus the River Bluff area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| However, there are others that we just lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| and I don't know for those who supported this if they want to add those back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| If you cross-reference the list, William Hastie Park is on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| The Turkey Creek Conservation Area is not in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| The Ten Mile Creek Greenway Park is not in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| The Forks of the River Wildlife Management Area is not in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| And then, of course, we already covered the River Bluff Wildlife Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| So if you want to merge these two lists accurately, that might be important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Mr. Greve, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| The way to handle that is to make a motion for a second amendment to include the ones that you left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8216)|
| 2:17:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8225)|
| 2:17:06| Tell us exactly what they are so that we'll have that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| I'll do this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| Mayor, why don't we just include all the parks like Mr. McAdams suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| Is there a reason not to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| I don't know why we wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| Rather than go to Exhibit A and, you know, this and that, just all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8238)|
| 2:17:26| I agree with Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| Well, then you've left out River Bluff because River Bluff is not really a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| Then we'll add that one on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| So all the city parks plus River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| Does that handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| Anybody disagree that that handles it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| I'll amend the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| Add River Bluff to all other city parks that aren't on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| Mr. McAdams thinks something else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| We had a discussion several months ago about World's Fair Park, which I know was the same discussion we're having now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8276)|
| 2:18:03| Mr. Donaldson, your brain might be better than mine right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| Did we zone World's Fair Park open space or C2 with the D1 overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8288)|
| 2:18:17| As I recall, the end result of that was to keep the C2 zoning in place and rejected the OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8297)|
| 2:18:24| Do we have any parks like Larry Cox Field that have an overlay on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8304)|
| 2:18:29| Did we do overlays that would include parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| Do we have any historic districts that include parks that might have an overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| There certainly could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| A little neighborhood park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| The infill housing overlay certainly could cover a park, but it's applicable only to new houses, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8325)|
| 2:18:53| Well, which are allowed in OS1, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| As long as it's less than 5% of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8338)|
| 2:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| Is there a motion and a second on that, on Mr. Bailey's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| There was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| There was, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| Let me suggest that while this is first reading and we could potentially just work something out here and then come back in two weeks and deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8349)|
| 2:19:23| let me suggest it might actually be cleaner to pause right now and say it's almost 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8363)|
| 2:19:31| There's a lot more confusion about how this ought to be done because, frankly, the overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| I would hate to eliminate the overlays in my neighborhood that people fought so hard for or some of the historic overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8375)|
| 2:19:43| and maybe it would make sense to say let's pick this up in two weeks and get it done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8383)|
| 2:19:51| That's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| I would disagree with the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| If we have two weeks until the second reading and we have omitted something, am I correct, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8396)|
| 2:20:03| that we could amend this on the second reading and add those omissions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| You can add new material at second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| That will throw it back to first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| but then you could pass it on to emergency if you wanted to do it all at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| One way to deal with this omission question, we have several here, is on the list that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8423)|
| 2:20:29| Why don't we say for the following parks and then just add to the bottom of it those on attachment A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| and just so we'll have the list of eight plus whatever he's picked up and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8434)|
| 2:20:42| The other option to me, it seems to me, is to say for all city parks and overlay parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| including but not limited to the following list, have the eight plus exhibit A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| and just say all parks, but especially these or at least these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| Name them by illustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| Basically what we did is we left out three parks, the River Bluff Wildlife, Ten Mile Creek, and Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| And so my amendment would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| What about Forks of the River Wildlife?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| That's what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Well, it's my amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Well, the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| All city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| Right now the motion on the floor is all city parks plus River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| I'm actually assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Motion to amend the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| And I think I got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| That's exactly what's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| That's what we're discussing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8494)|
| 2:21:35| Part of the value that we get with zoning parks that Mr. McAdams has been real good at pointing out is a process thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8495)|
| 2:21:42| that there is a process that we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| And part of that process is that it's sort of what you ran into when you tried to, Mr. DellaVoppe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| tried to change the open space code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| We actually cannot do anything here that MPC hasn't considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8511)|
| 2:21:56| And part of the protection is that it's not legal for MPC to sit back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| we're going to talk about changing the zone of a park from OS1 to R1 and us to say, oh, no, we want to make it C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8521)|
| 2:22:10| Part of the protection we get because there is a process on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| Mr. Swanson, my question for you is that what MPC, my understanding of what they considered was actually list A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8533)|
| 2:22:20| not all the city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| I do not think that you are because I think it came to MPC with a recommendation that all city parks be considered for rezoning to OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8543)|
| 2:22:34| It's what I think the original recommendation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| And then they made that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| Mr. Becker, Mark here, we did, in fact, consider all city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| Oh, okay. We're good then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| According to the list that we have with the parks, recreation and greenway plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| I was going to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| The motion that's on the floor is to amend the amendment to say all city parks plus River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| I have a great deal of respect for Mr. McAdams' legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| I don't want to do anything that's going to really mess this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| So would somebody ask Mr. McAdams a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| Mr. McAdams, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| I was going to come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| My concern is not the subject matter of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| It is the provision of the zoning ordinance that deals with amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| that says an amendment to the zoning ordinance must describe the property that is going to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8614)|
| 2:23:43| Hence the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| And I don't believe saying parks generally is an adequate description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| So if you want to say parks generally, I would urge you to say the parks on Exhibit A and any other city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8631)|
| 2:23:58| But I would, I think it's safer from a rezoning perspective to list the parcels of property that are being rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8638)|
| 2:24:07| which is the list of city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| The reference in the resolution that you adopted in May said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| respectfully request MPC to consider rezoning all land located within all city parks listed on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8656)|
| 2:24:24| So Mr. Becker's point was correct on that, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| But they did go broader as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Could I ask Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| He's the proponent of this proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| And so I would ask Mr. Bailey if he felt comfortable with stating his proposed amendment as was just stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8679)|
| 2:24:48| all city parks specifically including the list included there and including River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| Are you comfortable with that as your motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| Well, I'm willing to go along with Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| You know, really what I was going back to is what Mr. McAdams originally said, which Mr. Donaldson, I could call on him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| which I believe they did look at all lands within city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8708)|
| 2:25:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8715)|
| 2:25:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8716)|
| 2:25:17| So are you comfortable with what was just stated as your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| I am, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| And is the seconder comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| I don't know who seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Are you comfortable with that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| Then we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8729)|
| 2:25:30| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| Go ahead, Charles, best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| The motion is to amend the ordinance to include all city parks specifically including the list that was provided and River Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8737)|
| 2:25:51| In the list provided as Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8755)|
| 2:25:56| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| And that's where I think we get a little extra coverage by saying all city parks including but not limited to the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8757)|
| 2:26:05| and have the eight listed and Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| In other words, the eight listed and Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| I may be thoroughly confused, but I think that's what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| Well, you said including specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| I'm saying including but not limited specifically to this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| In other words, that we're not excluding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| If you're not in love with that language, but including but not limited to, I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8785)|
| 2:26:26| It's just archaic legal language, but if you like it, it's good with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| Well, I want to make sure we don't do the inclusio unius exclusio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| You don't have a single list, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| Ms. Roddy, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| Yes, I think my question deals with this discussion that Mr. Swanson and Mr. DelVolpe are having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8802)|
| 2:26:48| and that is if there are parks that are left off Exhibit A or the ordinance as amended, are they also included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8808)|
| 2:26:58| And I'm thinking of the Pocket Park on Oklahoma and Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| I'm thinking of the Pocket Park on Highland Avenue that we just dedicated on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| Neither of those appear in Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| So, Mr. Swanson, it would be interesting that those are all swept into this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| They are intended to be swept into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| And, Mr. Swanson, have we answered Vice Mayor Becker's question regarding historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| and whether or not this would nullify that in those cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| I would have to ask Mr. Donaldson about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| That's out of my area of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| I guess Vice Mayor Becker made the point that if we have a conflict of interest, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| this is only the first reading, and so we could address that on second reading next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| Because I am concerned that we not inadvertently do something that nullifies the historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| in some of these smaller pocket parks in our historic areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| But we could deal with that on second reading, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101019?start=8874)|
