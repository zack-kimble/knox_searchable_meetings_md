| 2:46:00| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9960)|
| 2:46:04| This is an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Who made the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| Do you agree with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| I have a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| Sheriff, would you care to come up here, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9975)|
| 2:46:16| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| I'd like to say one other thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| I checked, and I think people in Knox County knows that we probably need a jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9979)|
| 2:46:24| We've got 676 people out on pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9984)|
| 2:46:29| But now the bracelet parts, which a lot of people were concerned with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| we've only got 19 people on bracelets right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| You know what 12 of them are for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| Driving under the influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| So I don't think there would be much danger going out and picking them up, you know, for anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| Unless they were driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| Sheriff, my question is, I think that probation and pretrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10010)|
| 2:46:57| probation probably shouldn't be under the sheriff's department just due to the fact that the prosecutor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10017)|
| 2:47:03| and the judges would want to separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| There's a conflict there, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| I talked to Commissioner Pinkston earlier, and he asked me if I would be in agreeance to take them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| At one time they were under the sheriff's office, and I did tell Commissioner Pinkston that I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| Now, I can't speak for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| I can't speak for the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| I think what you probably need to do is have the judges down here maybe for the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| and ask their opinion of probation going under the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| I'll do whatever you all want me to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| but I think that the judges should have some input because some people do think that there is a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10054)|
| 2:47:40| and I also think that probably Dwight's here from the mayor's office, and maybe he wants to speak to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| But it was always there until what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| It was always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| It was there when I first came in 1980, and it was at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| it was probation and parole was under the sheriff's office, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10072)|
| 2:47:57| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| Is there anybody here from retirement or can answer how much this is going to cost the pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10082)|
| 2:48:12| to bring these four under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| I believe that there's no cost as far as going back, but there's some liability going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10094)|
| 2:48:20| and how much is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| I don't even want to say how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10104)|
| 2:48:27| Commissioner Richard Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| I'm the general counsel for the Knox County Pension and Retirement Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| I can't tell you a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| All I can tell you is that those individuals, when they transfer over, would transfer funds with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10116)|
| 2:48:45| It would be just like all the other employees who have been transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| I understand, and they're going to have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| just like Knox County had to put up that $57 million because the funds that the deputies put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10132)|
| 2:48:59| they had $39 million of their own, but it was still short to go back years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10139)|
| 2:49:05| I would have to assume that when these four individuals move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| they'll probably, the funds that they have in their accumulated plan will not cover back years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10149)|
| 2:49:15| and they'll have to buy back into it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| Commissioner, I mean, I think the sheriff can speak to it better there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| Just cut two or three of them that don't have prior experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10161)|
| 2:49:25| Three would be new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10168)|
| 2:49:29| But there's still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| Only one would have to commit to his funds, his retirement funds, just like we did when we opted into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10172)|
| 2:49:38| His funds would have to go into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| His funds would go into the plan, and if it's short, he'd have to buy whatever it's short by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10180)|
| 2:49:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| And the other three would be just like new hires, like if we hired them tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| But there is a liability moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10190)|
| 2:49:55| As soon as they come into the plan, Knox County is liable for that pension going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10195)|
| 2:50:02| We have to make sure that at the end of that 25 or 30 years that the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| So we do have a liability, and I want to, it's an actuary number, trying to figure out what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10207)|
| 2:50:13| but there is some number attached to that, and I would like to know what that cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| Quite frankly, I don't know enough about this to make an informed decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| I think this is a very complex, difficult issue, and we have an amended motion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10224)|
| 2:50:35| We don't have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| because I need to know more about this before I can make a vote either way today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10240)|
| 2:50:46| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10246)|
| 2:50:47| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10247)|
| 2:50:53| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10256)|
| 2:50:57| I know that was requested, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10257)|
| 2:51:01| I think it was requested to finance last week, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| It's such a moving target number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| We discussed it briefly at pension board this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| I don't know if staff can come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| I hope they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| I'm not saying I can't speak for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10273)|
| 2:51:14| I'm not an actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| There are, to say it's not going to be a cost to the pension fund is not a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10276)|
| 2:51:22| There's no question it will be a cost to the pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| But what that cost is, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| The individual that has built up dollars just like the $43 million that was put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10288)|
| 2:51:36| from the uniformed officers deferred comp, 457, whatever it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10296)|
| 2:51:43| that there will be money put in, but there's no question there will be a cost to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10303)|
| 2:51:47| But I concur with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| I'm needing some more data on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| Commissioner, two things you need to know about in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| The pension board, we don't generally, as a matter of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| we don't disclose, have public discussions about individuals' retirement accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10320)|
| 2:52:09| It's trying to maintain at least some level of privacy for individual employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10329)|
| 2:52:15| Secondly, if these employees are on the early part of the curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10335)|
| 2:52:23| certainly an actuary can give you a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| but when you look at the assumptions that are involved in arriving at that figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| it means very little because, as you know, most employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| you've got turnover within five years of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| So that's factored in obliquely, but it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| And so any number that you are given, it's certainly not precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| It is precise at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| But keep in mind all the assumptions that are built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| I understand the assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| and I understand that there's also an additional cost of budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| how much more we put into this plan versus a regular employee's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10381)|
| 2:53:08| the match part of what the county puts into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10388)|
| 2:53:11| So that's a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10391)|
| 2:53:12| But regardless of that, my problem is this is just a reorganization of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10392)|
| 2:53:20| Whether or not that's a good idea or a bad idea, I can't answer that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10400)|
| 2:53:25| and I'm not prepared to vote on that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| And that's why I've asked for the deferral because we didn't have this in front of us at our committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| with the information to properly discuss them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| and I would like to be able to do that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| Commissioner Lutho, I believe there's a lot of things we've got to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| Even the disability clause is different than the people that work here for the county and under the other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10422)|
| 2:53:47| There's a lot of things that we don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| We've got to start looking at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| Well, there's just a lot more to this issue than just simply a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10431)|
| 2:53:55| I'm not saying it's a good idea or a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| I don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10442)|
| 2:54:03| A comment was made that one of the individuals would be making more money than the former sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10443)|
| 2:54:11| Is that true or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| The ones who are transferring, one of the employees has 12 years previous experience with the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10454)|
| 2:54:22| and now he's had six with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| Those six years will not count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| So if that person moves over, he will start next year with year 12 and a half or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10465)|
| 2:54:32| and will have to work 13 more years with the sheriff's office before he reaches his 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10472)|
| 2:54:37| The other employees, and I think, you know, the mayor's office is just concerned as a county commission about this pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10477)|
| 2:54:46| But these other people coming over is no different than three sheriff's department employees finding other jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10486)|
| 2:54:53| and going out and hiring three employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| They're starting at day zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| So if you have concerns with this growing pension fund, you need to look at the bigger picture of a cap or something else someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10497)|
| 2:55:05| Basically what you're saying is the sheriff should never bring on any new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10505)|
| 2:55:08| If you're concerned about them starting a process, because three of these are just starting with day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10508)|
| 2:55:14| and they would stay there 25 years before they're in the position to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10514)|
| 2:55:20| Two other quick points about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| Seven years ago, we had a probation pretrial organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| The pretrial was basically, and I don't want to use the word nonfunctional, but it wasn't functioning very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10528)|
| 2:55:35| And one of the programs we started was this electronic monitoring program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| And that's the one that sort of alerted us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| I think last year we had six or seven people on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| Today I think we have 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| If you're on that bracelet, if you're not on that bracelet, you'd be in a jail at $74 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10546)|
| 2:55:52| So 22 of those bracelets times 74 is about $1,600 a day, which quickly adds up to $10,000 over $10,000 a week, $50,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10552)|
| 2:56:01| We hope to grow that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10561)|
| 2:56:04| And we think the sheriff's office is the place to grow it for one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10564)|
| 2:56:08| If someone clips that bracelet at 2 in the morning, we want a sheriff's employee to go after that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10568)|
| 2:56:14| These people are not model citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| They wouldn't be wearing that bracelet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10579)|
| 2:56:20| So that's what triggered this movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| All we're moving is the pre-trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| And the budget is staying the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| Mr. Cook will take a pay cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| And the difference in his pay cut will go what is the ñ if we hire a new probation director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10590)|
| 2:56:37| it's a smaller organization, it will be a smaller piece of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| We are not increasing any budget on this whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10599)|
| 2:56:44| We're shifting part of the budget to the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| With regards to increasing the bracelets, that's going to be a judge's determination, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10606)|
| 2:56:50| I mean, the judges have to determine if they put more people on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| And the judges are becoming more and more comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| I mean, if not, it wouldn't have grown from six or seven to 22 in a matter of, you know, a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10615)|
| 2:57:01| So if it continues to grow, remember that's one of the ways we're going to solve our jail overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10621)|
| 2:57:07| That's just a piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| And I know the sheriff would like to talk more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| That's a small piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| But every person on a bracelet is one person that's not in a jail cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| That's $74 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| I want to make sure I understand now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10639)|
| 2:57:20| It's probation and pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| We are considering just the pretrial section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10642)|
| 2:57:26| Just maybe the pretrial to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| In the pretrial, they handle electronic bracelets that are put on before you ever go to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10648)|
| 2:57:34| The people on probation are the ones that have sort of gone through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| You know, they've already been sentenced or whatever their disposition is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| and we're winding that group down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10661)|
| 2:57:46| In other words, the goal is for those people to be off of probation someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| Now, Commissioner Pinkston is suggesting that probation also be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| So it would all be in the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| So probation and pretrial, that's what you're suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| That way we wouldn't be raising a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| We wouldn't have to hire another director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| We wouldn't have to give them a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| You know, here we are up here trying to cut expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| We're not increasing the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| It may even end up in a decrease of budget, and we're not getting another car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| How many employees now are we talking about if you take the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| Maybe 13, 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| Right now we're talking about pretrials, about six, seven, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10705)|
| 2:58:29| But if we increase it, it would be like another seven or so is about 13, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| Remember, we're looking at two different classes of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| We're looking at the ones who have not gone to trial yet in the pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| The probation are the ones who are on the end of the justice cycle, hopefully, for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10721)|
| 2:58:48| It's a different type of client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| It just seems to me that this is the place to do it, is to shift it over into the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10730)|
| 2:58:55| But I'm also sensitive to my colleagues here in that putting it all under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| I think I want to look at it a little further before I'm able to do it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10745)|
| 2:59:06| Mr. Harms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10746)|
| 2:59:07| Commissioner Paxton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| Mr. Harms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| Can I just say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10750)|
| 2:59:11| Commissioner Hammond, you asked about an employee in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| But let me just say that I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| certainly don't know what that employee's present salary or projected, but I want to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10758)|
| 2:59:25| It certainly would, I think, if I'm in the same area, ballpark of his salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| it certainly is possible that by the time that employee retires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| he would have a higher retirement income than what you referenced earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10773)|
| 2:59:39| But I would add that there are other employees who could be in that same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10779)|
| 2:59:44| It depends on, you know, salary increases over the years, length of service, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10784)|
| 2:59:48| So, yes, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10790)|
| 2:59:51| But, again, it depends on a lot of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| I want to make sure, nothing I say here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| the board is without portfolio on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| The pension board, we just handle it however you all decide to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10801)|
| 3:00:06| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10807)|
| 3:00:08| Sheriff, let me just maybe clarify this a little bit for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10808)|
| 3:00:11| The people on pretrial can be misdemeanors or felons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| The people on probation are misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| So you have a larger crowd that has more of a possible propensity for violence that are on pretrial release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10819)|
| 3:00:32| than probation, in my opinion, if that helps you in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10832)|
| 3:00:38| I believe there's more misdemeanors on there, Sheriff, with what this report I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| But would you care to come back to the podium just a minute, Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10842)|
| 3:00:47| This is going into your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| Now, I don't know whether Mr. Harms can tell me or you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| What is this director going to be making in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10851)|
| 3:00:54| I can't tell you exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| I want to say it will be in line with the other chiefs' pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| Well, he's going in as a chief then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| Well, he's called the director is what the position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| But it would be in line with the director or department heads who are chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10865)|
| 3:01:10| And it's my understanding that it's about a $27,000 cut in pay from what he makes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10870)|
| 3:01:17| His salary at the mayor's office would not be taken into consideration for his retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10877)|
| 3:01:25| The retirement salary for the pension would be only on the salary that he makes while at the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10885)|
| 3:01:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10893)|
| 3:01:34| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10894)|
| 3:01:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10895)|
| 3:01:36| What does the starting pay for an officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| $30,000, $27,000, $30,000, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| $27,000, $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| Then basically what you're talking about, Mr. Arms was talking about we're talking about you're not hiring anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10905)|
| 3:01:52| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10912)|
| 3:01:53| But these are not going to be police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| These people are not going to be hired to be on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| We need more patrolmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| And I just think two of the four would be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| The director would be a certified officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| And also one other individual has been through our academy and in hopes of sending the other two through our academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10925)|
| 3:02:11| to make that total of four people who would have arrest powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10931)|
| 3:02:16| Yeah, but they're not going to be on the street patrol officers is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| They're going to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| No, they would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10940)|
| 3:02:21| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10941)|
| 3:02:22| They would be working with pretrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| I'm really concerned about one of these after getting these 19 bracelets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10944)|
| 3:02:28| This really bothers me that one gentleman is out on a bracelet and this is his fourth offense for drunk driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10948)|
| 3:02:35| or driving under the influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| Let me make that clear real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| I know that's the judge's bracelet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| But I thought we had a mandatory deal after three convictions that you went to the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10961)|
| 3:02:47| And if I could make a point, that's why we think, and I think it's well said, the pretrial includes felons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10967)|
| 3:02:55| And the judges decide who those people are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10975)|
| 3:02:57| and we'd prefer that class of client who are felons to be with the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10977)|
| 3:03:03| The probation piece, we're going to post a position since that organization will no longer be dealing with felons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10983)|
| 3:03:11| our game plan is to do this with less money, not more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| We are going to post a position for a new probation director, but it will be a downsized staff, probation only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=10995)|
| 3:03:21| We think that some game will be less money, not more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11001)|
| 3:03:26| And I guess the other point I'd like to make, I can't speak for the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11006)|
| 3:03:30| but I think if you go visit with the judges or ask the Justice Committee, the judges are going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11010)|
| 3:03:35| we'd like the probation away from the sheriff's office for the very point Commissioner Anders makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11015)|
| 3:03:41| We would agree with pretrial going to the sheriff's office for the very reason we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11021)|
| 3:03:48| You're dealing with felons, and I'd prefer when a felon cuts off that bracelet for someone in the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11028)|
| 3:03:53| to go at them at 2 o'clock than someone in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11033)|
| 3:03:57| So, again, we're planning on doing this for less money, not more, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11037)|
| 3:04:02| I think the judges, if you talk to them, will say pretrial with the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11042)|
| 3:04:09| probation with the mayor's office, and Brad can probably discuss that more eloquently than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11049)|
| 3:04:16| Commissioner Arms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11056)|
| 3:04:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11057)|
| 3:04:18| Like I stated at commission, that's the carrot in front of us, less salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11058)|
| 3:04:23| But not a commissioner up here can control those salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| In the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11068)|
| 3:04:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11069)|
| 3:04:30| He can raise them, give them bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11070)|
| 3:04:31| He can promote them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11071)|
| 3:04:32| It's just like in the mayor's office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| You all get bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11075)|
| 3:04:36| You raise people's salary every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| So that's the carrot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| That's the carrot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11080)|
| 3:04:41| Now, I realize in the sheriff's office he has to serve so long before he gets his promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11081)|
| 3:04:45| I tell you, every single position we post is graded by Francis Ferguson's organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11085)|
| 3:04:53| and the grade is what we give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| And we already know what this grade is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11095)|
| 3:04:56| It's a number, like 21-step-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| We grade the jobs and compare them to counties and other organizations who have a self-comparable job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11099)|
| 3:05:08| and that's how we pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11108)|
| 3:05:13| These are all merit board positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11115)|
| 3:05:16| And they would have to fall under the guidelines and parameters of the salary set forth by the merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| What I'm saying is they can be promoted just like they can be in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11120)|
| 3:05:24| He can promote them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11126)|
| 3:05:27| We have no control over what these people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| They can be promoted for a cause, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| 919 that we're looking at as it's written talks about pretrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11136)|
| 3:05:41| and we've allowed it to get off into probation, personalities, and pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11141)|
| 3:05:47| I think maybe we need to back up and look at what consultants have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11147)|
| 3:05:52| that it's best that pretrial be off with the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| that the mayor's office probably can handle the probation part of it, which we've drug into it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11156)|
| 3:06:03| The judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11163)|
| 3:06:06| Easy for you to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| Country boys can't get more than three syllables at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| The judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11173)|
| 3:06:14| That's the last time I'm going to try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11174)|
| 3:06:19| And one last word that I was going to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| Oh, it's something like the public welfare might be better served with the pretrial being with the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11181)|
| 3:06:30| And that, you know, probation, the personalities and pay, I had not brought into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11190)|
| 3:06:38| and I was fully ready to vote on 919 today based on the things that maybe I had a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11198)|
| 3:06:46| We had more come out maybe in the finance committee meeting because it was a line item transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11206)|
| 3:06:53| and the finance committee decided it was not a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| It was something that needed to be discussed by everyone here in the big room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| And I think that it's been well presented, and I'm in favor of it in its original form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11220)|
| 3:07:07| Yeah, Commissioner Wright, I'd like to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| The substitute motion on the floor is to defer, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| I did ask for the studies, the two studies, and so far I have not received them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11232)|
| 3:07:18| But I did ask for the studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| They said there were two studies, how this was beneficial to us, and I have not received them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11240)|
| 3:07:25| Everything I asked for, I didn't get anything until this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11248)|
| 3:07:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11251)|
| 3:07:33| Well, when this came up, I was reading over it, and even before I was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11253)|
| 3:07:39| I was walking down the halls of the city county building and wondered why the pretrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| and pretrial diversion and pretrial, quote, arrest and pretrial incarceration, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11263)|
| 3:07:53| was in the mayor's office to start with because, I mean, it just didn't seem to fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11273)|
| 3:07:59| because of the felony situation that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| And we're talking about people who are going to be in jail for over a year if convicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11283)|
| 3:08:09| And sometimes we have potentially violent people who are going to be out in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11289)|
| 3:08:15| And to be honest with you, when I read over this, I thought to myself, well, it's about time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11295)|
| 3:08:21| because I didn't like where it was to start with, no offense to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11301)|
| 3:08:25| and the mayor's office and administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| but I really feel a lot better about, you know, police officers doing police officer type work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| And when we have people that are, quote, incarcerated, whether you have a chain around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| or whether you have an ankle bracelet around them or whether we have them over on Maloneville Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11316)|
| 3:08:41| I really feel personally that it needs to be under the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| I think the pension things, we have a school of officers that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| We have schools going on every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11330)|
| 3:08:51| We have people coming and going in employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| We have new officers that are being trained and being hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| This is constantly affecting our budget and constantly affecting our pension and retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11336)|
| 3:09:03| And if we're going to deal with the pension and retirement, we need to deal with pension and retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11343)|
| 3:09:07| But I think from an organizational standpoint, I would go with 919 as it was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11347)|
| 3:09:13| I think it's probably a good organizational move just from my own professional approach on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11353)|
| 3:09:18| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11358)|
| 3:09:19| I think it's better for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11359)|
| 3:09:20| I think it's safer for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| I think it's the right thing to do for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| And then we can worry about these, you know, the probational stuff at some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11366)|
| 3:09:30| But I would recommend that we would go ahead and deal with the 919 tonight and make Knox a little bit safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11370)|
| 3:09:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11381)|
| 3:09:42| I wasn't finished a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| I think another thing that we need to consider here is the mayor's office doesn't get called into the federal judge's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11386)|
| 3:09:52| when we talk about jail overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11392)|
| 3:09:55| The sheriff's office does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11395)|
| 3:09:56| And being on the overcrowding task force, this is going to be something that I'm going to push for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11396)|
| 3:10:00| that we use more of the bracelets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| We use more of pre-trial release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11402)|
| 3:10:05| You know, because this past weekend the commissioner's office called the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11405)|
| 3:10:08| and the sheriff's office and said, hey, cite as many as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| The jail's getting crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| And so when we come to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| I've been up here screaming that for 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| Yeah, when we come to that point every weekend, when football season gets here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11417)|
| 3:10:21| we're going to have to set up a temporary jail somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11421)|
| 3:10:24| But if the 30-day evaluation goes through, you know, putting it off for 30 days goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11424)|
| 3:10:32| But I think what we need to understand is the federal judge can call us right back to his office for inaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11432)|
| 3:10:38| And I personally, there's only one person higher on my list than a federal judge, and it's God almighty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11438)|
| 3:10:45| So I don't want to be called before one, but for inaction on jail overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| I think this is a tool that we can use if we expand it, and I think it belongs in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11449)|
| 3:10:54| Mr. Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11454)|
| 3:10:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11456)|
| 3:10:57| Let me put some, I'll be brief, I don't want to belabor this too much, some hard data into the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11457)|
| 3:11:03| I was able to dig this out of the budget stuff we were given a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| To answer Commissioner Hammond's question, I believe there are 19 employees listed under the probation office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11467)|
| 3:11:13| with a payroll of $815,000, 12 probation officers with salary ranging from 39 to 44,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11473)|
| 3:11:22| with an average of about 41.9, two secretaries and five, one pretrial probation officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11482)|
| 3:11:29| one pretrial release officer, a support person, a monitoring coordinator, and a director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11489)|
| 3:11:35| And I assume we're talking about moving the five of what's before us now, the five over to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11495)|
| 3:11:43| And I just want to ask the sheriff is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11503)|
| 3:11:46| Seven, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11506)|
| 3:11:47| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11508)|
| 3:11:49| Okay, then it would be the 12 probation officers would stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11509)|
| 3:11:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11512)|
| 3:11:53| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11513)|
| 3:11:54| Okay, the seven would be moving to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| So I would just ask you, to you, two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11519)|
| 3:12:00| If it was delayed 30 days, does that do anything to hinder the process or pros or cons of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| And also, do you have an opinion on having those 12 probation officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11526)|
| 3:12:13| Well, I mean, it's exactly what we've talked about before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11533)|
| 3:12:16| I would say that you probably ought to talk to the judges about the way they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11536)|
| 3:12:20| The difference is probation people have already been sentenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| and they have been sentenced to a period of less than 11 months and 29 days usually for a misdemeanor on probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11544)|
| 3:12:31| Anybody on pretrial release can be from the least misdemeanor to the highest felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11551)|
| 3:12:38| So you're talking about two completely different groups, a group which is much more, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11558)|
| 3:12:44| has a potential for violence of pretrial release more than likely than probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11564)|
| 3:12:51| I'm not going to say that holds in every case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| but more than likely they have a higher potential to reoffend or commit a violent act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11573)|
| 3:13:00| That's why some feel those people need to be designated to law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11580)|
| 3:13:05| in case they don't do what they're supposed to do so we can go pick them up as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11585)|
| 3:13:11| I mean, if Commissioner Pinkston said, J.J. or Sheriff, you're getting these, would you say, hey, that's good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11591)|
| 3:13:17| Or would you say, wait a minute, I don't want to, or somewhere in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11597)|
| 3:13:21| He asked me about that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| Whatever is your pleasure, I will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| And does the 30 days do anything to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| I mean, I don't think it would affect me one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11612)|
| 3:13:33| Are any of these people, Sheriff Cranston, are they secretaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| Are they going to have to have more secretaries or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11616)|
| 3:13:39| It's my understanding that the people who are coming are the same people who have been in these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| There will be no other employees except the ones that are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11623)|
| 3:13:46| and their salaries and their budget items in their budget will also be transferred with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11626)|
| 3:13:51| Are you going to have to hire secretaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| Who's going to do the secretarial work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| There's two out of the seven that are, I think, that do secretarial work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11638)|
| 3:14:02| It's my understanding that this will be a net zero cost to the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11642)|
| 3:14:08| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11648)|
| 3:14:13| Substitute motion on the floor is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11653)|

| 3:15:30| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11730)|
| 3:15:31| Ten yes and eight no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11731)|
| 3:15:35| To defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11735)|
| 3:15:36| To defer for 30 days until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11736)|
| 3:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11739)|
| 3:15:40| Mr. Chairman, can I ask what information is needed in this next 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11740)|
| 3:15:44| I don't frequently come back and write back in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| I don't want more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| Is there something on the pension board we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| Oh, I'd like to see the two studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| Who did the studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11755)|
| 3:15:56| They told me today that Mr. Troy said they had two studies, and I asked him for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| I'd like to see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| That's going to be beneficial to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| I'd like to see all the commissioners have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| And I would like to see the starting salaries of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| The sheriff's got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| Well, you can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11771)|
| 3:16:12| There's no need now unless you just want to give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| We've already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11774)|
| 3:16:15| Actually, $32,399 is the starting salary, and the director would be making $83,273.40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11775)|
| 3:16:22| Eighty-three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11782)|
| 3:16:23| I think that's a $27,000 or $30,000 cut from what he makes now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11783)|
| 3:16:32| And also, I'd like to understand, we're going to leave, with this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11792)|
| 3:16:38| we're going to leave the 12 probation officers by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| So who's going to manage them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| Because right now they're being managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11804)|
| 3:16:45| So are you going to pick one of the 12 to manage that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11805)|
| 3:16:49| It looks like you're moving out that secretarial support for the parole folks that are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11809)|
| 3:16:55| I'd like to get a feel for how you're going to manage the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| We've got a position posted now for that director with, I think, several people who applied for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11818)|
| 3:17:05| That's just simply director of probation, and I think that's about a job that's like mid-50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11825)|
| 3:17:12| Okay, so that's a new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| Yeah, but we're planning on filling from within, which would mean we're not going to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11834)|
| 3:17:18| It's sort of like we did with Eric when Eric left, not go outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11838)|
| 3:17:25| And you're not going to, but if you take a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11845)|
| 3:17:28| you're going to take his parolees and spread those over the other 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11848)|
| 3:17:35| And then what about secretarial support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| So I just want to get a feel for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11857)|
| 3:17:38| We sort of balance that workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| Now, one thing, the secretarial support, part of that is these people come in all hours of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11859)|
| 3:17:45| checking with the probation officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| A lot of that is just receptions where when that person comes to the door, taking their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11867)|
| 3:17:52| So, you know, we have several hundred people on probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11872)|
| 3:17:55| The probation officers meet with them on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11875)|
| 3:17:59| So part of that is not as much secretarial as receptionists and pulling their files| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11879)|
| 3:18:05| and scheduling them in to see the probation officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11885)|
| 3:18:08| Okay, but that's going to be a new person as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11888)|
| 3:18:12| We're not expanding staff size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| We will do this for less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| Okay, so you're going to have 12 people, and we separate these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11897)|
| 3:18:21| or whatever you want to call it, we have 12 people on the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11901)|
| 3:18:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11905)|
| 3:18:26| And no new cars, no new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11906)|
| 3:18:28| Also, Mike, if you could do us kind of an organizational chart of if it's separate and then if it's together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11908)|
| 3:18:35| And also the suggestion was made about asking the judges their feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| and if you could ask the judges and either have them report to us or you report to us on what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11919)|
| 3:18:45| I might prefer that one of them come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| I hate to speak for a judge, but I know how they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| I had a question for Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| Mike, you said you, I think you quoted you as going to hire within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11934)|
| 3:18:58| then you said you were going to put down for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| So you've already got somebody set within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11940)|
| 3:19:02| No, we've got a position posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11942)|
| 3:19:06| But you said you were going to hire within, so I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11946)|
| 3:19:09| Well, we're going to try to hire within because we've had people from within that we know that are qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11949)|
| 3:19:13| that have already bid on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11953)|
| 3:19:16| Okay, but I just figured you had your mind made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| No, our mind's not made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| We have a, I know we have at least three internal Knox County candidates who have applied for the job who are qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11960)|
| 3:19:35| We're going to, we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11975)|
| 3:19:39| Yeah, we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| 920, which is the sheet that was passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11980)|
| 3:19:45| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| requesting that Knox County District Attorney General Randy Nichols request that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11988)|
| 3:19:54| conduct an investigation into purported thefts of monies from the Knox County Solid Waste Department by employees thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=11994)|
| 3:20:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12005)|
| 3:20:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| Some actions have been going on in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| especially in the Hollis community over the solid waste with the disappearance of some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12012)|
| 3:20:17| And I've been working quite heavy on that in the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12017)|
| 3:20:21| I asked Brad Mays to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| Brad, I asked you to come to daylight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| We always get you at the tail end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| You've been sitting here for three hours at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12027)|
| 3:20:30| But I want to let you say a few things and I'll pick up after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12030)|
| 3:20:36| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12036)|
| 3:20:37| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12037)|
| 3:20:40| And as you know, I've been investigating your green waste program for approximately two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12040)|
| 3:20:45| Recently, a former solid waste employee who was the green waste coordinator, Rodney Rocket, resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12045)|
| 3:20:52| Right after he resigned, he contacted me and he told me some information that had been troubling him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12052)|
| 3:20:58| He told me that somebody was stealing money from the Hollis green waste program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12058)|
| 3:21:04| And he also told me that he had received information from his superiors that they did not want this investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12064)|
| 3:21:11| and they did not want law enforcement investigating the theft of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12071)|
| 3:21:16| I've done a series of open records requests, first year finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12076)|
| 3:21:21| and sure enough, there was only a couple of thousand dollars a year being paid to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12081)|
| 3:21:26| And I know firsthand there should be $15,000, $20,000 a year being collected at Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12086)|
| 3:21:33| So, second of all, I asked the solid waste department for a record of the deposits from Hollis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12093)|
| 3:21:40| and I received a response back that they checked the deposits and everything looks fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12100)|
| 3:21:47| So then I have kept R. Larry Smith involved with this because it's his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12107)|
| 3:21:53| And R. Larry, when he heard the amounts supposedly collected and deposited, he instantly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12113)|
| 3:21:58| that's not right, that can't be right, I used that facility myself, and I agreed with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| So Commissioner Smith saddled up, went to Hollis, got six months' worth of the receipts, and we added them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12123)|
| 3:22:11| And best we can tell, there's about $6,000 stolen in that six months alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12131)|
| 3:22:18| I went back and tried to reconcile and impute the past five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12138)|
| 3:22:24| and it's kind of fuzzy to do, but I guesstimate the theft between $30,000 and $69,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12144)|
| 3:22:31| The problem is Rodney Rocket knew that money was being stole before he resigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12151)|
| 3:22:39| and claims that he was told law enforcement doesn't need to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12159)|
| 3:22:45| Further, when I checked the budget, it seemed that the solid waste department had only budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12165)|
| 3:22:51| and expected like $1,000 or $2,000 income from this facility, which if they know what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12171)|
| 3:22:58| there's no way they should only budget this amount of money coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12178)|
| 3:23:02| Now, Rodney Rocket wanted to come here this evening, but he has a mother that's very, very ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12182)|
| 3:23:08| She's been sent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12188)|
| 3:23:09| She's 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12189)|
| 3:23:10| Rodney's the only child to take care of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12190)|
| 3:23:12| He's a widower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12192)|
| 3:23:13| So what he did was he called and made a consensual tape-recorded conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12193)|
| 3:23:18| and interview with me for you all to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| So I'm going to play that for you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12201)|
| 3:23:48| If I were missing that kind of money as a small businessman, which I have been in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12228)|
| 3:23:53| I'd be darn interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| No, I have no reason, other than the reasons that I have told you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12235)|
| 3:24:00| that Tom Salter recounted to me that Bruce Waitrick had told him the amount of money involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12240)|
| 3:24:09| was not substantial enough to want any further action, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12249)|
| 3:24:15| And he didn't want the authorities called. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12255)|
| 3:24:18| Words to that effect, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12258)|
| 3:24:20| Okay. Now, Mr. Salter went to a meeting later in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12260)|
| 3:24:25| And after he went to that meeting, this was a TDOT meeting concerning grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12265)|
| 3:24:31| He came back, and you mentioned to me that he came back very upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| Could you describe that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| Well, he expressed concern over the fact that during the course of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12278)|
| 3:24:44| it was like a conference, if you will, you know, with several, you know, big agenda kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12284)|
| 3:24:49| In the course of this conference, there was someone from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12289)|
| 3:24:57| and I assume it was a lawyer, an attorney, you know, for the state council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12297)|
| 3:25:03| that pointed out in the course of the presentation that if money is being misappropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12303)|
| 3:25:13| or stolen, if you will, and you as a county elected or appointed or hired official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12313)|
| 3:25:23| as a county official, does not notify the authorities, the appropriate authorities of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12323)|
| 3:25:34| then in some way you are held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12334)|
| 3:25:40| And I remember I did not attend this meeting, but afterwards Tom Salter did discuss this with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12340)|
| 3:25:49| and expressed some serious concern and reservation over the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12349)|
| 3:26:01| the theft of the metal, which has been an ongoing issue, and obviously the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12361)|
| 3:26:06| monetary theft of the green waste collected funds at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12366)|
| 3:26:14| it concerned him that he may be held accountable for not disclosing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12374)|
| 3:26:22| And not calling the authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12384)|
| 3:26:25| You know, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12385)|
| 3:26:28| Mr. Robert, so before you left and resigned from your position with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12388)|
| 3:26:39| then Mr. Salter was completely aware that some of this money was being stolen from Halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12399)|
| 3:26:47| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| I mean, it was widely known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12409)|
| 3:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| And as I said, he had discussed the matter, as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12415)|
| 3:27:00| I was not partial to it, but in what his recounting to me was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12420)|
| 3:27:07| he had discussed the matter with Bruce Weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12427)|
| 3:27:10| And let me ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12430)|
| 3:27:12| If it was not widely known that the Halls green waste money was being stolen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12432)|
| 3:27:18| I'll stop it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12438)|
| 3:27:19| I think you all get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12439)|
| 3:27:22| He informed me of this months ago, or about six weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12442)|
| 3:27:26| He informed me of a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| Everything he's told me is checked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12448)|
| 3:27:31| I'm a private citizen in custody of empirical evidence that suggests there has been criminal activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12451)|
| 3:27:38| within your solid waste department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| Knox County has a clear conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12462)|
| 3:27:44| One employee has resigned and admitted that criminal activity that was felony level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12464)|
| 3:27:50| Knox County has a conflict of interest in investigating this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| and Mr. Weitrich's wife is the investigator for the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12474)|
| 3:27:58| So the law director's office has a conflict in investigating this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| considering that according to this testimony, as was given to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| Mr. Weitrich didn't want it investigated in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| So that is why Commissioner Smith has presented you all with this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12490)|
| 3:28:15| to ask the TBI to intervene and investigate what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12495)|
| 3:28:19| This money that was collected was originally intended to pay natural resources recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12499)|
| 3:28:25| and disposal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12509)|
| 3:28:30| Brad, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12510)|
| 3:28:31| And as he mentioned, you know, folks, this is even bigger than the P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| The amount of money that we're looking at may potentially be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| I have seen some of the records and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12520)|
| 3:28:42| This guy here has got his facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| He's got his facts and he's ready to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| And I want to thank Larry VanGilder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| Larry, he helped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12529)|
| 3:28:50| He went down there and checked on some of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12530)|
| 3:28:54| He did a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12534)|
| 3:28:55| And he was harassed by county employees as he was leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12535)|
| 3:28:58| He was followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12538)|
| 3:28:59| And we thought that was sort of unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| But we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| I'm asking that an independent, let the Attorney General look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12544)|
| 3:29:08| keep everybody out that needs to be out and let an independent group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12548)|
| 3:29:11| and I'm assuming the TBI would be the group to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| And, guys, this is just the tip of the iceberg, just the tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12555)|
| 3:29:22| As you know, Mr. Brad has come here months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12562)|
| 3:29:27| Mr. Hammond, I remember months and months ago you made the comment, or years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12567)|
| 3:29:31| made the comment that your children or whatever lived close by and that the smell and whatnot, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12571)|
| 3:29:38| that was years ago, and that's when it first came up, I think, when Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| when you came and you talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| And Brad has been working on this for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| This is just one aspect of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| And this is just one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| We also have it at Forks the River, also a green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12592)|
| 3:29:56| But bottom line is we need to be looked at independently and keep us out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12596)|
| 3:30:02| keep the law department out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12602)|
| 3:30:04| And, you know, what happens is what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12604)|
| 3:30:06| You know, we're here to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| I don't mean to imply that there is absolute criminal activity on all kinds of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12609)|
| 3:30:17| or any kind of conspiracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| What I'm telling you is there is one employee who has admitted to criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12619)|
| 3:30:24| They claim they only stole $1,000, and there's a lot more money than that missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12624)|
| 3:30:31| There could be other people in this department involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12631)|
| 3:30:34| And Mr. Rocket is adamant that he was told not to get the authorities involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12634)|
| 3:30:40| So we need to take this into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12640)|
| 3:30:43| We need to just let a third party investigate it and let the chips fall where they may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12643)|
| 3:30:48| Another thing, it has been broken into twice, the location, and that has not been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12648)|
| 3:30:53| Brad, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| There was at least one sheriff's department report made on one of the break-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12655)|
| 3:30:59| But the problem is, and I'm looking at the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| and I'm still trying to get the timeline placed together on this, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12661)|
| 3:31:06| and I might be wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12666)|
| 3:31:08| but it appears to me that the police reports for when the disappearances happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12668)|
| 3:31:13| happened after the conference that Mr. Rocket mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12673)|
| 3:31:17| But before the conference, none of the thefts were reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12677)|
| 3:31:21| And I want to mention, too, in closing, too, that, you know, if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12681)|
| 3:31:24| I will apologize to Knox County, to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12684)|
| 3:31:27| But from what I see, you know, it's, we're talking quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12687)|
| 3:31:32| I think it needs to be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| Enough to buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12694)|
| 3:31:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12695)|
| 3:31:36| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12696)|
| 3:31:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12698)|
| 3:31:40| Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12700)|
| 3:31:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12701)|
| 3:31:42| I guess it's your, because I was going to ask a question, and I guess I've got the answer now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12702)|
| 3:31:46| is, you know, why not the sheriff's department to investigate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12706)|
| 3:31:50| But I guess you want a third party, independent, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12710)|
| 3:31:56| You know, that's the same thing when Fred Sisk, when he found stuff in his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12716)|
| 3:31:59| he went just outside, got the TBI involved, and they're doing their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12719)|
| 3:32:03| I think that this is the logical group would be the TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12723)|
| 3:32:06| Let them take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12726)|
| 3:32:07| Sisk set a great example when he done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12727)|
| 3:32:10| He got a lot of heat over it at first and some negative publicity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| but it was the right thing to do given the situation that it was a county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12733)|
| 3:32:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12742)|
| 3:32:24| Yes, I know that Brad is always very thorough when he does these investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12744)|
| 3:32:29| You know, a lot of this is based on hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| I guess my only question was, and I'm basing it on what we did when there were certain things came to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12751)|
| 3:32:38| with the P cards and the travel cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12758)|
| 3:32:40| is that really an independent person is the internal auditor that works for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12760)|
| 3:32:45| and there's not a conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| Is this something, and I'm just putting this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12768)|
| 3:32:50| is this something that we need to let the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12770)|
| 3:32:54| let the internal auditor look at first to determine the magnitude of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12774)|
| 3:32:58| and to see just where the problem is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12778)|
| 3:33:00| Of course, that would go through the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12780)|
| 3:33:02| or do we want to go straight to the TBI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12782)|
| 3:33:08| You know, my feeling on that, Dr. Briggs, is I think they're going to be embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12788)|
| 3:33:12| This is elementary, extremely elementary accounting practices, and it had been caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12792)|
| 3:33:17| Somebody's got caught with their hands in the till, and it needs to be somebody outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12797)|
| 3:33:23| If anybody in Knox County is involved, it's going to be tainted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12803)|
| 3:33:26| And I would also respectfully submit to you, Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12806)|
| 3:33:30| that criminal activity has already been admitted on a felony level by one of the employees within Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12810)|
| 3:33:39| So we don't need an audit to tell us whether or not criminal activity has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12819)|
| 3:33:43| It's already been admitted, and a resignation has been tenured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12823)|
| 3:33:47| Now, as far as he's talking about elementary mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12827)|
| 3:33:50| I sent an open records request to Mr. Salter's office for the 2009 fiscal deposits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12830)|
| 3:33:56| and he reported that for that 12-month period there was $3,000 and some odd dollars deposited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12836)|
| 3:34:02| Commissioner Smith obtained a six-month sample for just the last six months from Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12842)|
| 3:34:08| and they tallied over $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| So if you were to assume that of the $3,000 deposited, $1,500 was the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12851)|
| 3:34:18| we would have $6,500 stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12858)|
| 3:34:23| And I've also looked at some of the payment histories for the dumpsters leaving the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12863)|
| 3:34:31| and I've tried to impute using that data the approximate amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12871)|
| 3:34:35| and the best number I could get was in the $60,000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12875)|
| 3:34:39| It may have been less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12879)|
| 3:34:40| We may have had an increase in volume or something, but there is a substantial sum of money missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12880)|
| 3:34:46| We've already had criminal activity admitted and a resignation tendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12886)|
| 3:34:50| We don't need an accountant to tell us that something bad has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12890)|
| 3:34:56| And I do appreciate it very much, and I know you've done a lot of hard work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12896)|
| 3:35:01| I see Bruce Weitrich there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| Is this something that you acknowledge, deny, unknown, or just what's your all's response to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12903)|
| 3:35:09| Mr. Briggs, if I could speak to this for just a minute, and can I ask what is it we are doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12909)|
| 3:35:16| Folks, there's no empirical evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12916)|
| 3:35:19| There isn't any evidence of any kind, and there isn't any testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12919)|
| 3:35:25| There's a recording of a man who is a litigant suing this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12925)|
| 3:35:30| talking to a gentleman who is a former employee who resigned rather than accept disciplinary action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12930)|
| 3:35:39| So let's set some context around this discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12939)|
| 3:35:44| Now, that said, Commissioner Smith, we welcome your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12944)|
| 3:35:49| Very clearly, we have had a problem with an employee who is no longer with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12949)|
| 3:35:54| whether it's Sheriff Jones or the TBI or the comptroller's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12954)|
| 3:35:58| we would welcome any outside assistance and any outside examination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12958)|
| 3:36:03| But this canonization of Mr. Mays, who is presently suing Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12963)|
| 3:36:09| and the consideration of an interview with Mr. Rockett, who resigned rather than take disciplinary action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12969)|
| 3:36:15| as some form of empirical evidence and testimony, makes no sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12975)|
| 3:36:21| and I don't think it should make any sense to any of you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12981)|
| 3:36:26| Just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12986)|
| 3:36:27| I had a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12987)|
| 3:36:28| I'm not taking anyone's word for it, because what I'm saying, some of that is hearsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12988)|
| 3:36:33| about he heard that someone doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| What I'm trying to decide, what facts do you agree on and what facts do you dispute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=12995)|
| 3:36:42| Clearly, we have never been involved in any kind of cover-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13002)|
| 3:36:45| or told someone do not take this to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13005)|
| 3:36:48| In fact, we have already filed a report with the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13008)|
| 3:36:52| That was faxed in this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13012)|
| 3:36:55| When we realized what was going on in regards, and you've got to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13015)|
| 3:36:59| there are several different things that were going on at these convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13019)|
| 3:37:04| When Mr. Salter first came to work for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13024)|
| 3:37:07| one of the main things that was brought to his attention was metal theft at the centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13027)|
| 3:37:11| It was so rampant that people were actually breaking into the centers at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13031)|
| 3:37:15| You recently read, we did an investigation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13035)|
| 3:37:19| The next thing he started looking at is this green waste money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13039)|
| 3:37:22| At the Halls Convenience Center, Goodwill Industries operates a compactor for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13042)|
| 3:37:28| You as a citizen come in there and you pay anywhere from $2 to $5 to maybe $10 to dispose of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13048)|
| 3:37:36| What that is, that money is then taken and turned over to Knox County and then is deposited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| The problem lies with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13061)|
| 3:37:43| The person doing the deposits has admitted to taking that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13063)|
| 3:37:47| At no point in time did we say, cover this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13067)|
| 3:37:50| We contacted the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13070)|
| 3:37:54| I alerted the Knox County law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13074)|
| 3:37:57| I met with people in the mayor's staff as soon as it came to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13077)|
| 3:38:00| What we've been able to determine is there's approximately $7,400 missing, give or take a few dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13080)|
| 3:38:07| That's what we think is missing in the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13087)|
| 3:38:10| We intend to go back to every other year that we have records and determine the entire scope of the missing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13090)|
| 3:38:16| But at no time was anyone told, I haven't even had a conversation with Mr. Rocket about this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13096)|
| 3:38:22| was he told not to do this or not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13102)|
| 3:38:25| That's a total fabrication on his part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13105)|
| 3:38:28| To get back to my original question, I'm not talking about cover-ups or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13108)|
| 3:38:33| We're not reporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13113)|
| 3:38:34| So you do think that there's been about $7,400 taken the first year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13114)|
| 3:38:40| We're very confident that that is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13120)|
| 3:38:42| Does that seem to be one individual or multiple sites or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13122)|
| 3:38:49| It's hard to say because when you have a chain of custody with that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13129)|
| 3:38:54| we can make a clear chain of custody when we get the money from Goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13134)|
| 3:38:58| They keep a receipt book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13138)|
| 3:38:59| So we generally, we're going to know how much money they actually brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13139)|
| 3:39:03| I have to send employees out there to bring that money to our office on Baxter Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13143)|
| 3:39:08| and that's where the deposit would be made by this employee who did admit to stealing roughly $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13148)|
| 3:39:15| Of course, my conversation with the comptroller's office, they flat told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13155)|
| 3:39:19| he says, well, generally they'll admit to about one-tenth of what they actually did take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13159)|
| 3:39:23| So I cannot say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| She did not implicate anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| I've not heard anybody else's name brought up in regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13167)|
| 3:39:31| Here again, and I welcome investigation, the Sheriff's Department, TBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| whoever you wish to send down there to go through these records to investigate the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13174)|
| 3:39:39| What has been done, I guess, legally about this criminal act to that employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13179)|
| 3:39:47| and what's been done to recover some of that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| We are just now coming to terms with exactly how much money that has been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13189)|
| 3:39:55| We just now sent this report over to the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13195)|
| 3:39:59| I spoke with them on either Thursday or Friday of last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13199)|
| 3:40:03| and they said they would review the case and make a recommendation to the district attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13203)|
| 3:40:07| as to what and how this needs to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| The state comptroller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13209)|
| 3:40:10| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13210)|
| 3:40:11| Is that the usual person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| I'm asking this for my own information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13213)|
| 3:40:14| Is this the usual person that investigates thievery at the county government level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13214)|
| 3:40:21| or how do you decide whether to refer it to the sheriff's office, the state attorney general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13221)|
| 3:40:27| the state comptroller, or the internal auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13227)|
| 3:40:30| I mean, how do you decide that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13230)|
| 3:40:32| Well, that's a good question because I asked that same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13232)|
| 3:40:35| The state comptroller's office basically said any time you have a theft involving fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13235)|
| 3:40:41| it needs to be reported within five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| That's a new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13243)|
| 3:40:44| Quite frankly, I wasn't aware of it, so we did make that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13244)|
| 3:40:48| Who do you report it to, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13248)|
| 3:40:50| The state comptroller's office, and then they indicated to me that they would review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13250)|
| 3:40:54| but ultimately the district attorney would make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| and make the decision as to whether they need to pursue criminal prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13257)|
| 3:41:02| So we have given them what we consider a preliminary report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13262)|
| 3:41:05| since we've only gone back one year in regards to these receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13265)|
| 3:41:09| They do have that report in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13269)|
| 3:41:12| Mr. Chairman, the state comptroller's office actually has a separate branch, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13272)|
| 3:41:18| dedicated to local government auditing practices, procedures, and improprieties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13278)|
| 3:41:24| Brad, show us the proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13286)|
| 3:41:28| Commissioner Briggs has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| You're still talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13290)|
| 3:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| You know, I believe that right now that's all the questions I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13292)|
| 3:41:35| I'll go ahead and yield the floor to whoever is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13295)|
| 3:41:38| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13298)|
| 3:41:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13300)|
| 3:41:41| Mr. Law Director, what is our responsibility now that this has been brought to our attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13301)|
| 3:41:46| Do we need to file something with the comptroller saying that we as a commission have been informed of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13306)|
| 3:41:50| or the fact that Mr. Wheatry has already done it, is that sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13310)|
| 3:41:53| That's sufficient as long as it has been duly filed and they're on notice, then we're good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13313)|
| 3:41:58| In terms of what agency you're desirous of having investigated, that's certainly the Board's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13318)|
| 3:42:05| Bruce, could I get a couple more questions, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13325)|
| 3:42:09| You said that you believe that $7,400 is the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13329)|
| 3:42:12| How many years are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| I believe, and I may be a little bit off on this, I think we have records that go back to 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13334)|
| 3:42:22| The contractor only requires them to maintain records for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13342)|
| 3:42:27| This program was put in place when John Evans was Solid Waste Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13347)|
| 3:42:32| and it's pretty much been in the same operations until just now here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| We obviously have made some changes on how this money gets handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13356)|
| 3:42:40| put in some additional checks and balances so this will never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13360)|
| 3:42:44| With the $7,400 the first year, would you calculate that maybe that's the same amount for the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13364)|
| 3:42:50| or would you think it's increased every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13370)|
| 3:42:53| I got a preliminary number, and I got it by e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13373)|
| 3:42:57| so maybe this number might change because they said it was a rough number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13377)|
| 3:43:01| The year before that, it was somewhat less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| I think it was in the neighborhood of $5,500, which probably explains it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13384)|
| 3:43:09| You know, we've not had an opportunity to look to see what kind of volumes that we are taking in at the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13389)|
| 3:43:14| but typically as the program starts, the volumes will probably increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13394)|
| 3:43:19| So, therefore, if someone was scheming money, I would think it would be kind of a linear progression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13399)|
| 3:43:23| meaning the back years will probably be less money being taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13403)|
| 3:43:27| Why did it take so long to change the procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13407)|
| 3:43:29| I mean, you're dealing with cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13409)|
| 3:43:31| You would think that if you're dealing with cash that there would be these checks and balances in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13411)|
| 3:43:36| I think there's two reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| First, when the program was first set up, the employee who actually handles it was a trusted employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13418)|
| 3:43:46| I mean, she was the office manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13426)|
| 3:43:48| I don't think we look in terms of theft as we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13428)|
| 3:43:52| That's the biggest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| We just don't think that we're dealing with dishonest individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13434)|
| 3:43:57| And then once it was set up, it just never was revisited until here recently when we realized, well, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13437)|
| 3:44:05| you need to incorporate at least two more steps in this so at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13445)|
| 3:44:10| the person who's looking at the entire deposit and the money never, ever comes in contact with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13450)|
| 3:44:16| And we have taken care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| Now, you said that you have no problem with someone coming in and looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13462)|
| 3:44:23| None whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13463)|
| 3:44:24| In fact, in my discussions with Tom Salter, when we first realized what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13464)|
| 3:44:29| and I believe this may have had something to do with them resigning, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13469)|
| 3:44:33| we need to get the Non-Executive Sheriff's Department involved in this because at first what we thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13473)|
| 3:44:37| or at least what we were hopeful was, is that this money was not missing, but it was bad bookkeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13477)|
| 3:44:43| that the receipts for the deposits were missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13483)|
| 3:44:46| But when you go back and look at what really got deposited, that was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13486)|
| 3:44:50| Clearly money was stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13490)|
| 3:44:53| If this is, for the law director, if this is referred to the district attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13493)|
| 3:44:58| would his office make a recommendation about a further investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13498)|
| 3:45:02| and who would do that investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13502)|
| 3:45:05| Well, the TBI is the investigative arm of district attorney's offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13505)|
| 3:45:10| Now, oftentimes they have an internal investigator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13510)|
| 3:45:12| but ultimately when they deal with fraud, waste, and abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13512)|
| 3:45:15| it's been their practice to refer to TBI, which is their investigative arm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13515)|
| 3:45:19| just like the FBI would be for the Justice Department on a federal scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13519)|
| 3:45:23| Well, it seems to me that discounting whatever Mr. Mays had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13523)|
| 3:45:28| Mr. Weitrick has confirmed that there is $13,000 missing, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13528)|
| 3:45:34| There may be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| We can say, well, that's not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| But I think to our citizens, if you ask them, $13,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13541)|
| 3:45:46| And I think that they look to us to say, if indeed this activity is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13546)|
| 3:45:51| they want us to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13551)|
| 3:45:53| So Mr. Weitrick has said he has no problem with these folks coming and looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13553)|
| 3:45:58| And so I'm going to support sending this on to the attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13558)|
| 3:46:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13562)|
| 3:46:03| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13563)|
| 3:46:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13564)|
| 3:46:05| If this goes on to the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| does that preclude our sheriff and local people from investigating the matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13567)|
| 3:46:17| Generally, if a state law enforcement agency assumes jurisdiction of the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13577)|
| 3:46:22| as a professional courtesy, normally local law enforcement will defer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13582)|
| 3:46:26| That's not to say that the TBI would not ask for a joint task force and involve the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13586)|
| 3:46:32| I'm just looking at things that we've referred on to the attorney general in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13592)|
| 3:46:37| And last week, we got the report from the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13597)|
| 3:46:41| and all the investigators about the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| It only took a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13603)|
| 3:46:45| I'm just thinking that we want to send this on and we get a report 14 months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13605)|
| 3:46:51| I mean, this isn't an elaborate group of mafia swindlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13611)|
| 3:46:57| It's people stealing scrap iron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| I'm not discounting what they did or I'm not discounting the incident at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13619)|
| 3:47:02| If it's $13, we need to look at it, much less $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13622)|
| 3:47:06| But I think our local people have the wherewithal to investigate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13626)|
| 3:47:12| On the audit committee, we studied this lady stealing money from coupon books out of Whittlespring School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13632)|
| 3:47:17| It only took two years for the TBI to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13637)|
| 3:47:20| Well, yes, she's less prosecutor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13640)|
| 3:47:22| I mean, it's going to take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13642)|
| 3:47:25| Commission, a lot of us won't be sitting here probably if we wait on the AG and the TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13645)|
| 3:47:29| That's just my own personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| I think this guy right here has the investigative ability to track that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13651)|
| 3:47:37| Let me just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13657)|
| 3:47:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13658)|
| 3:47:39| It would be the decision of the attorney general's office whether to ask our office to investigate it or the TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13659)|
| 3:47:47| That would be left up to the attorney general's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| And he has, on occasion, asked us to investigate and not the TBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13669)|
| 3:47:55| So that ultimately would be his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13675)|
| 3:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| Well, thanks for straightening it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13678)|
| 3:47:59| And my second question, and I had this question before Mr. Vanovate got up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13679)|
| 3:48:04| He was alluding to this, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13684)|
| 3:48:06| At what time did Mr. Rockett bring these allegations forward, before or after he was terminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13686)|
| 3:48:14| So there's a credibility issue there with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13694)|
| 3:48:18| Mr. Rockett informed me of these allegations approximately one week after he resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13698)|
| 3:48:26| So the timeline here would establish that apparently more than one person had to know of this months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13706)|
| 3:48:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13715)|
| 3:48:36| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13716)|
| 3:48:37| I meant resign, not terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13717)|
| 3:48:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13720)|
| 3:48:41| And he never had that discussion with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13721)|
| 3:48:42| He never discussed or brought up any type of theft of this magnitude whatsoever, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13722)|
| 3:48:50| So when it went public was, of course, after he left our employment, when it became public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13730)|
| 3:48:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13735)|
| 3:48:57| Mr. Shouse, if I could just speak a little bit in follow-up to what the sheriff said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13737)|
| 3:49:02| And I think it's a legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13742)|
| 3:49:04| This is a pretty straightforward matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| It is not going to take a lot of investigative horsepower to establish what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13746)|
| 3:49:14| and what the county's exposure might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13754)|
| 3:49:17| And for our part, we are very comfortable with the sheriff's office has a good white-collar crime unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13757)|
| 3:49:22| that has investigators that are more than capable of handling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| And I would think that that would be something that they could do in relatively short order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13765)|
| 3:49:31| if that's the pleasure of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| If it's referred to another agency, it might take a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| But we are very comfortable with any of these outside investigative bodies coming to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13776)|
| 3:49:44| Again, what I was uncomfortable with today and will continue to be uncomfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13784)|
| 3:49:49| is hearing things like empirical evidence and testimony when we're dealing with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13789)|
| 3:49:54| who was a litigant against the county and a former employee who resigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13794)|
| 3:49:59| rather than accept disciplinary action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13799)|
| 3:50:01| Clearly, this is something that needs examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13801)|
| 3:50:04| We'd ask the body to refer it to the appropriate law enforcement agency of your choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13804)|
| 3:50:09| and let's move on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| I don't think we're going to accomplish anything else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13811)|
| 3:50:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13814)|
| 3:50:15| Yeah, I want to agree with what Dwight was saying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13815)|
| 3:50:20| You know, Dwight, I'm going with evidence that I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13820)|
| 3:50:22| I'm not with this other gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13822)|
| 3:50:24| I've never met this Mr. Rockett, so I don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13824)|
| 3:50:27| I just know that the months that we pulled the records on and what we saw, it's going to come out, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13827)|
| 3:50:33| It's going to come out quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| And I want to assure the fellow commissioners that with Bruce, I think from this step going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13835)|
| 3:50:42| I have no problem whatsoever with Bruce and his people making sure that everything is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13842)|
| 3:50:47| What happens is these people at Goodwill take their money to the tower at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13847)|
| 3:50:53| and they count it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13853)|
| 3:50:54| Correct me if I'm wrong, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13854)|
| 3:50:56| They count the money out with the Knox County employee that's there and they make sure that jives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13856)|
| 3:51:00| and then they put that money up and they lock it for the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13860)|
| 3:51:03| So there's no problem with the people at Goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| They've been in the clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| It's from the time it got from Knox County's site down to whoever counted the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13867)|
| 3:51:12| I don't know how it works, but I'm sure Bruce is going to take care of that from here on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13872)|
| 3:51:16| double check the money and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13876)|
| 3:51:18| And, Brad, you had something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13878)|
| 3:51:20| I didn't want to give out any evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13880)|
| 3:51:24| Well, I placed it on the board a few seconds ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13884)|
| 3:51:26| But we don't want to do that, Brad, because that will not be admissible then in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13886)|
| 3:51:31| So we want to, you want to hold that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13891)|
| 3:51:35| I would just like to make the following statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13895)|
| 3:51:41| Supposedly there was no empirical evidence that everybody's admitted this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13901)|
| 3:51:47| Rodney Rockett's not reliable, but he was telling the truth and he was right and the money was stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13907)|
| 3:51:53| And everybody involved said they have no problem involved in cooperating with the TBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13913)|
| 3:51:59| and they had no problem letting them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| Well, why not let them do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13922)|
| 3:52:05| Nobody's voiced any objection to letting the TBI do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13925)|
| 3:52:08| Let's send it on as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13928)|
| 3:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13930)|
| 3:52:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13931)|
| 3:52:13| I guess my question is, is if we do request that the district attorney looks at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13933)|
| 3:52:20| I mean, are we the ones that say it goes to the TBI or is it the district attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13940)|
| 3:52:26| I see the sheriff shaking his head, yes, that he's the one that decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13946)|
| 3:52:30| So it's really what we're voting on here is just to refer the case to the district attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13950)|
| 3:52:35| I mean, is that right, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| Whoever he puts it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13957)|
| 3:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13960)|
| 3:52:41| So really this part about going to the TBI is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13961)|
| 3:52:47| I mean, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13967)|
| 3:52:48| JJ, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13968)|
| 3:52:51| Okay, you guys are capable to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13971)|
| 3:52:53| He will decide, and that's what we've got to go by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13973)|
| 3:52:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13978)|
| 3:52:59| Whatever they decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13979)|
| 3:53:00| You know, I do share some of Commissioner Shouse's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13980)|
| 3:53:03| It seems like when we get the TBI involved, you know, we'll all be drawing Social Security or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13983)|
| 3:53:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| I would like to put it into a quick, because I don't think it's going to be that complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13990)|
| 3:53:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13993)|
| 3:53:15| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13995)|
| 3:53:16| I would just like to say again we've spent an awful lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=13996)|
| 3:53:21| Bruce has agreed to have the TBI or the FBI or the CIA, whoever, come in and investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14001)|
| 3:53:27| Let's vote to get it done and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| We voted for open government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| Let's get it done behind us and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| So I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14013)|
| 3:53:36| I don't see any other lights, so the motion on the floor is now to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14016)|
| 3:53:42| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14022)|
| 3:53:44| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14026)|
| 3:53:47| Make a motion and send it to the Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14029)|
| 3:53:50| Properly moved and seconded and sent it on to the Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14030)|
| 3:53:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14034)|
| 3:53:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14035)|
| 3:53:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14036)|
| 3:53:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| We think that's the ghost of Amy Bross that we hear over the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14039)|
| 3:54:06| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14046)|
| 3:54:07| Before we go into zoning, I have one to go to page 25 of the business number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14047)|
| 3:54:14| This guy needs to get on a plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14054)|
| 3:54:21| Read it into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| Discussion and presentation by the Capital Group, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14063)|
| 3:54:27| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14067)|
| 3:54:30| Page 25 under other business number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14070)|
| 3:54:36| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14080)|
| 3:54:43| Let me tell you what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| I've been having discussion and Fred Sisk also with the Treasurer's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14085)|
| 3:54:50| We've been at the Trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| What did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14092)|
| 3:54:54| He's the Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14094)|
| 3:54:55| He says what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14095)|
| 3:54:56| Well, he's dealing with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14096)|
| 3:54:58| But anyway, the Trustee's office, this group has contacted us months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14098)|
| 3:55:06| and they wanted to come down and have a short presentation to us about buying our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14106)|
| 3:55:14| We know they'd probably have to go out for bid, but if we decide to even entertain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14114)|
| 3:55:20| So name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14120)|
| 3:55:23| Wendell Moore from Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14123)|
| 3:55:26| And I'll turn it over to Kirk Shadle, who's the Chief Operating Officer of Expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| to walk you through that very quickly and answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14129)|
| 3:55:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14132)|
| 3:55:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14135)|
| 3:55:36| Just state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14136)|
| 3:55:37| Kirk Shadle, New Hope, Pennsylvania.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14137)|
| 3:55:41| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14141)|
| 3:55:42| I realize it's been a long day for you, and I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14142)|
| 3:55:45| Essentially what I wanted to present to the Commission today was an option that would allow Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14145)|
| 3:55:52| Knox County, to monetize its delinquent tax receivables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14152)|
| 3:55:58| the cash flow from outstanding delinquencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14158)|
| 3:56:01| to accelerate the recognition of revenue into a current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14161)|
| 3:56:06| And as we've passed out to you today is a presentation on essentially this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14166)|
| 3:56:13| In essence, what we're proposing that the county look at is looking at the receivables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14173)|
| 3:56:21| the assets that are sitting on your books yet not collected by your county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14181)|
| 3:56:27| and trying to recognize that revenue on an expedited basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14187)|
| 3:56:32| accelerating that revenue into your current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14192)|
| 3:56:35| What currently happens in all of Tennessee counties is those taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14195)|
| 3:56:40| those delinquent taxes, are collected by your trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14200)|
| 3:56:43| There is a mechanism of enforcement that spans two-and-a-half, three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14203)|
| 3:56:50| and the counties across Tennessee do a good job at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14210)|
| 3:56:56| What unfortunately is required in that collection mechanism is a statutory timeframe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14216)|
| 3:57:04| allowing the taxpayers to satisfy these obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14224)|
| 3:57:09| At the end of the day, if in fact taxpayers do not pay those obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14229)|
| 3:57:13| they are sent through an administrative foreclosure process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14233)|
| 3:57:18| What we're proposing and what we seek the commission to look at is a process that adds no administrative burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14238)|
| 3:57:27| does not involve our financing company or any financing company with the interaction with your taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14247)|
| 3:57:34| All it does is look to monetize, to accelerate the recognition of revenue into your current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14254)|
| 3:57:42| The advantages of this obviously are the concept of essentially having your tax rolls paid in full on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14262)|
| 3:57:51| It's as if every taxpayer walked into the trustee's office and paid their taxes on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14271)|
| 3:57:57| This process can be used on an annual basis to accelerate the recognition of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14277)|
| 3:58:05| Many jurisdictions, as Mr. Moore mentioned, do this on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14285)|
| 3:58:11| Nashville-Davidson County does this now the third year since this law was enacted in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14291)|
| 3:58:18| It's allowed them to recognize almost $80 million in revenue over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14298)|
| 3:58:25| And that in essence is the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14305)|
| 3:58:28| I'd be more than happy to take any questions or amplify on this type of a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14308)|
| 3:58:33| But in essence, what it would allow Knox County to do is recognize something in the neighborhood of $15 million in this current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14313)|
| 3:58:44| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14326)|
| 3:58:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14328)|
| 3:58:49| It's hard to tell where the sound is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14329)|
| 3:58:52| Do you do this where you literally buy the debt and then you collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14332)|
| 3:58:57| or are you taking a percentage of the collected debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| We are essentially buying the cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14341)|
| 3:59:03| We are not collecting the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14343)|
| 3:59:05| We don't interact with Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14345)|
| 3:59:09| That is the job of the trustee and will continue to be his job under this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14349)|
| 3:59:15| In essence, what we're doing is taking accrued interest that would accrue post the sale as our fee, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14355)|
| 3:59:24| for accelerating the revenue to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14364)|
| 3:59:28| If you look at the last page of the presentation, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14368)|
| 3:59:33| what this chart shows on this page is that by monetizing your tax delinquencies on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14373)|
| 3:59:45| there's a delta, there's a difference between the collection rate that the trustee is able to achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14385)|
| 3:59:50| and this acceleration of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14390)|
| 3:59:53| And that delta, that difference is the net benefit to the county on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14393)|
| 3:59:59| But it is in no sense do we interact with the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14399)|
| 4:00:03| or have any collection activities in the county at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14403)|
| 4:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14407)|
| 4:00:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14411)|
| 4:00:14| I'd like to ask Fred Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14414)|
| 4:00:15| Fred, can you come in and weigh in on this and tell us the difference between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14415)|
| 4:00:18| and Mr. Harve as to what's going on there and tell us what your opinion is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14418)|
| 4:00:24| And have you met with these gentlemen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14424)|
| 4:00:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14427)|
| 4:00:28| I've known Mr. Moore for, you know, probably three years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14428)|
| 4:00:31| He presented this originally at the Tennessee Trustees Association meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14431)|
| 4:00:36| and talked with him a couple of times as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| And I've read the statute several times and I've talked with the trustee in Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14440)|
| 4:00:45| and it seems to work pretty well for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| They seem to be happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14447)|
| 4:00:50| And like he said, you know, there is no interaction with the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14450)|
| 4:00:54| The trustee's office still collects, you know, the property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14454)|
| 4:00:58| You know, in essence what's happening is, you know, the county is fronting the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14458)|
| 4:01:05| and, you know, and then we repay that loan, you know, through collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14465)|
| 4:01:16| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14476)|
| 4:01:19| Help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14479)|
| 4:01:20| I want to understand how you do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| In other words, you're saying that let's say Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14482)|
| 4:01:26| Mr. Sisk says that we have $15,000 delinquent or $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14486)|
| 4:01:31| You would come in and say, all right, we're going to give you that $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14491)|
| 4:01:35| or a percentage of that, but we're going to charge you interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14495)|
| 4:01:39| And so you're going to be watching Mr. Sisk's collections, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14499)|
| 4:01:43| to make sure that you're getting your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14503)|
| 4:01:45| But when we say interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| I'm sure that you're going to be working with his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| even though you're not going to be going to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14509)|
| 4:01:51| You're going to be going to his office and saying, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| let's find out how you're doing here on your delinquent taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14513)|
| 4:01:57| Is there any, not pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| but is there any suggestion that perhaps you guys need to speed it up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14519)|
| 4:02:03| because we fronted Knox County $15 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14523)|
| 4:02:06| I mean, I'm just trying to understand how this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14526)|
| 4:02:09| because I don't see from a business standpoint how you can come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14529)|
| 4:02:13| all right, we're going to give Knox County $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14533)|
| 4:02:15| and then just sit back and say we'll just wait and see what comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14535)|
| 4:02:19| So I'm trying to get a good feel for how you do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14539)|
| 4:02:23| NSE has actually a very good tax collection statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14543)|
| 4:02:27| The trustee does a good job in a statutory fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14547)|
| 4:02:31| Essentially what we do is we model that collection performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14551)|
| 4:02:36| Prior to making a proposal to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14556)|
| 4:02:39| we don't have much in the way of discussions with Nashville Davidson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14559)|
| 4:02:44| who are currently doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14564)|
| 4:02:46| Essentially what happens in Nashville is that they provide us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14566)|
| 4:02:49| as probably they do the finance department in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14569)|
| 4:02:54| with a tape of what collections have come in each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14574)|
| 4:02:57| Essentially we tick and tie off of our records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14577)|
| 4:03:01| to ensure that those redemptions are occurring in the appropriate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14581)|
| 4:03:07| No, we're not in the business of telling the trustees in any county that we do business in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14587)|
| 4:03:12| We do business in a lot of counties across the country, how to perform their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14592)|
| 4:03:17| Essentially what we're doing is prior to us making a purchase offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14597)|
| 4:03:21| we're looking at the redemption patterns and the practices in that county before making an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14601)|
| 4:03:27| So the monies that would come in for the delinquencies, it would go to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14607)|
| 4:03:31| because you've already given the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14611)|
| 4:03:33| It comes to the trustee, the trustee then forwards it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14613)|
| 4:03:35| Now what type of interest rate do you charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14615)|
| 4:03:38| The interest is embedded into the interest rate in tenancy statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14618)|
| 4:03:44| It's 18% on the outstanding balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14624)|
| 4:03:49| You said 18%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14629)|
| 4:03:51| It's 1.5% a month, which essentially works out to an 18% interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14631)|
| 4:03:56| The important thing to note on this is that that's only if you were to go to a full year's holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14636)|
| 4:04:04| of the liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14644)|
| 4:04:06| For the most part, for instance, in Nashville-Davidson, we pay a premium for that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14646)|
| 4:04:11| and in essence our return works out to be something in the neighborhood of 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14651)|
| 4:04:17| And how long is the contract for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| It's an annual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14659)|
| 4:04:20| So it's yearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14660)|
| 4:04:21| In Nashville-Davidson, they bid it annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14661)|
| 4:04:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14664)|
| 4:04:26| Regent Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14666)|
| 4:04:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14668)|
| 4:04:31| When you're purchasing the debt, are you purchasing just the current year's debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14671)|
| 4:04:37| or the obligation that's out there that's delinquent, or are you purchasing the, well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14677)|
| 4:04:45| The total portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14685)|
| 4:04:46| What we do across all of our portfolios is we're buying the total delinquency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14686)|
| 4:04:53| So it includes not only this year what they consider the fresher liens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14693)|
| 4:04:57| but also the ones that have been outstanding for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14697)|
| 4:05:01| Embedded in that is a lot of accrued interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14701)|
| 4:05:04| If a lien has been out for two and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14704)|
| 4:05:07| there's a significant amount of 18% interest that's embedded into that delinquency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14707)|
| 4:05:13| and we buy that interest and forward that back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14713)|
| 4:05:17| So in essence, up to the day we purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| any interest that's accrued to the benefit of the county is the county's to retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14719)|
| 4:05:25| Because, you know, right now, if you take a look back at the last, say, six, seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14725)|
| 4:05:32| Knox County has been averaging right at collecting about one and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14732)|
| 4:05:38| maybe just a hair more, million dollars in interest off of delinquent taxes every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14738)|
| 4:05:45| So I guess what I'm curious at is that some type of analysis that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14745)|
| 4:05:53| because we've got a pretty good record going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14753)|
| 4:05:58| that every year we've got one and a half million dollars coming in in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14758)|
| 4:06:03| And if we move to this, how much does it help Knox County by getting our money up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14763)|
| 4:06:12| maybe investing it somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14772)|
| 4:06:14| Right now we could only take that money and invest it, I don't know, one and a half, 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14774)|
| 4:06:20| but we're getting it up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14780)|
| 4:06:23| So how much of a benefit are we getting by doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14783)|
| 4:06:29| I assume we would be giving up that one and a half million dollars in interest to have that money up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14789)|
| 4:06:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14799)|
| 4:06:40| That's exactly what would happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14800)|
| 4:06:42| In essence, what you're doing is you're giving up that interest to get the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14802)|
| 4:06:47| that you wouldn't collect until year two and year three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14807)|
| 4:06:50| If you go back to this chart that I was showing you, this is not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14810)|
| 4:06:55| This is actually an upstate New York county, which also has an 18% interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14815)|
| 4:06:59| And I use it just as a point of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14819)|
| 4:07:02| And you'd obviously have to do your own analysis internally in your finance department to see if this made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14822)|
| 4:07:07| But in essence, what you're doing is you're giving up interest on liens that you would have accrued to your benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14827)|
| 4:07:15| post the sale in return for having accelerated pushing all of the revenue that would come in years two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14835)|
| 4:07:21| and three under this sort of curve that the statutory occurs in all of the Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14841)|
| 4:07:28| Well, obviously, like you said, but we're collecting 18% a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14848)|
| 4:07:32| We don't have any investments out there that we collect 18% a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14852)|
| 4:07:36| Even if it takes two to three years to, say, collect on property A before they finally pay, if they pay in full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14856)|
| 4:07:44| Knox County has collected a lot of interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14864)|
| 4:07:47| Again, as I was saying in Nashville-Davidson, we're paying in that jurisdiction, and every place is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14867)|
| 4:07:55| but it's an analogous county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14875)|
| 4:07:57| I use it just as a point of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| We paid a premium on those assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14879)|
| 4:08:03| So in essence, you're paying something in the neighborhood of about 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14883)|
| 4:08:07| You're giving up about 8% to obtain a significant more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14887)|
| 4:08:13| So we wouldn't be giving up quite all the $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14893)|
| 4:08:16| Maybe you're buying, I mean, because you're looking to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14896)|
| 4:08:21| So you pay money up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14901)|
| 4:08:23| You expect to make more money at the end, and I'm just curious as to how much that ends up being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14903)|
| 4:08:28| and whether or not it's worth it to Knox County or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14908)|
| 4:08:31| As I was suggesting, it was about 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14911)|
| 4:08:34| About an 8% so that we get our money up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14914)|
| 4:08:36| And I think the counties that do this, and again, if you look on the front of this little presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14916)|
| 4:08:45| give you a sense of who we're doing business with, very sophisticated counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14925)|
| 4:08:49| In essence, what they're saying to themselves is we have budgetary priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14929)|
| 4:08:54| We have issues that we need to confront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14934)|
| 4:08:56| We're not looking to raise taxes on our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14936)|
| 4:08:59| What is the best way to go about trying to monetize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14939)|
| 4:09:02| or to collect as much of our tax revenue as we can in the current fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14942)|
| 4:09:08| And a lot of places, New York, L.A., have decided that this is an option for them to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14948)|
| 4:09:13| And let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14953)|
| 4:09:16| Let's say the county puts together a portfolio of these properties and we're going to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14956)|
| 4:09:26| Let's say you agree to buy that portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14966)|
| 4:09:29| Do you have the right to come back in and reject some properties that you feel may not be a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14969)|
| 4:09:36| that's going to be a collectible type of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14976)|
| 4:09:39| Every county handles these issues differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14979)|
| 4:09:43| but all I can say is the only other Tennessee county that does this right now, the portfolio is the portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14983)|
| 4:09:50| There would be cases where the tax lien is actually an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14990)|
| 4:09:54| It may be on a government building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14994)|
| 4:09:56| It may be on a property that actually paid and the payment was misallocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=14996)|
| 4:10:03| But that's the only area of putback that's allowed under the Nashville-Davidson code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15003)|
| 4:10:09| So if you were to take a look at the list of properties that you've purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15009)|
| 4:10:13| and let's say you take a look at one and it's had a history of nonpayment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15013)|
| 4:10:18| or you think that there might be a problem with the ownership or the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15018)|
| 4:10:22| that it's not a very good investment or likelihood of it actually paying their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15022)|
| 4:10:30| you don't have a right to say, I don't want this property anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15030)|
| 4:10:34| I want a different piece of property that's of equal value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15034)|
| 4:10:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15038)|
| 4:10:39| So, in essence, I think you've actually hit on the other important thing that you would want to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15039)|
| 4:10:45| when you think about this option is that not every property in Knox County is going to redeem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15045)|
| 4:10:55| even at a foreclosure sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15055)|
| 4:10:57| There are vacant and abandoned lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15057)|
| 4:10:58| There are lots that have been demoed and have outstanding taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15058)|
| 4:11:02| that are significantly in excess of the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15062)|
| 4:11:06| Those are losses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15066)|
| 4:11:07| Those will never be recovered under this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15067)|
| 4:11:10| In a structure that we've put together, we understand that there are going to be losses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15070)|
| 4:11:15| and we account for that in our purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15075)|
| 4:11:18| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15078)|
| 4:11:20| If a property that was saved within your portfolio never pays up and it goes to a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15080)|
| 4:11:27| I guess those proceeds would go to you after the base tax is paid or how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15087)|
| 4:11:33| In essence, if it is pushed to a tax sale, the proceeds minus the cost to the trustee and the attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15093)|
| 4:11:43| the district attorney who forecloses on the property, after those fees have been satisfied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15103)|
| 4:11:48| we retain the base tax and whatever interest is recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15108)|
| 4:11:52| Most times, well, I can't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15112)|
| 4:11:56| In some cases, those taxes are paid in full and other times those taxes are paid partially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15116)|
| 4:12:01| And in other times, they're not paid at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| There's zero and they're struck back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15123)|
| 4:12:08| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15128)|
| 4:12:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15129)|
| 4:12:10| I think this is a, I met with a gentleman, not you, but this gentleman, another fellow back in the winter or spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15130)|
| 4:12:16| It's an excellent vehicle for jurisdictions that have substantial cash flow problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15136)|
| 4:12:21| which I don't think we're experiencing, at least I haven't heard from Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15141)|
| 4:12:27| And in that regard, I'd like to ask John if he has an opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15147)|
| 4:12:32| We've got Fred's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15152)|
| 4:12:33| I'd like to see if John has a, do you think this is something that would be beneficial or not necessarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15153)|
| 4:12:41| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15161)|
| 4:12:42| I mean, we have to monitor our cash flow, and that's something that we work closely with the trustee's office on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15162)|
| 4:12:48| It's something that we could certainly entertain a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15168)|
| 4:12:51| We wouldn't be opposed to putting this out for a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15171)|
| 4:12:54| But, you know, the short of it is these gentlemen have said their cost of funds is about 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15174)|
| 4:12:59| Our cost of funds is about 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15179)|
| 4:13:01| And so, you know, we can analyze that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15181)|
| 4:13:05| And we talked about, okay, we've got a proposal to build or to bring in more money for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15185)|
| 4:13:11| We don't have any specific proposals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15191)|
| 4:13:14| So, anyway, I certainly would not be against RFP and put that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15194)|
| 4:13:22| I don't see necessarily a need to do this, but we can certainly talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15202)|
| 4:13:27| If you had to issue some TANs, tax anticipation notes, what would you pay on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15207)|
| 4:13:32| It would be under 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15212)|
| 4:13:33| Under 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15213)|
| 4:13:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15214)|
| 4:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15215)|
| 4:13:36| Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15216)|
| 4:13:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15217)|
| 4:13:38| Let me see if I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| You're basically saying you would loan us the money and that as we collect it, we pay you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15220)|
| 4:13:46| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15226)|
| 4:13:47| The only quibble I would have with the last comment is this is actually a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15227)|
| 4:13:52| So this is revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15232)|
| 4:13:53| This is not debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15233)|
| 4:13:54| You're not increasing the debt capacity or the debt load of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15234)|
| 4:13:58| You're actually selling your receivables and taking in revenue so that it actually goes into the revenue category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15238)|
| 4:14:04| not into the debt category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15244)|
| 4:14:06| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15246)|
| 4:14:07| But at the end of the day, we still have to pay you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15247)|
| 4:14:10| The taxpayers paying us back, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15250)|
| 4:14:14| The question that Commissioner Smith asked I guess really needs to be answered by Fred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15254)|
| 4:14:19| Does this take Mr. Harb and that firm out of the loop or do we still owe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15259)|
| 4:14:24| or do we decrease that expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15264)|
| 4:14:27| The current fees that the district attorney or whatever law firm we're using to prosecute foreclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15267)|
| 4:14:36| will continue to be paid to that firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15276)|
| 4:14:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15279)|
| 4:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15280)|
| 4:14:42| Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15282)|
| 4:14:47| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15287)|
| 4:14:53| Do you have anything to wrap it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15293)|
| 4:14:56| You know, all I'd say is that as you're looking and thinking about budgetary issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15296)|
| 4:15:00| if, in fact, you determine that, you know, you're looking at a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15300)|
| 4:15:04| or there are additional revenues that you're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15304)|
| 4:15:07| this is something that a lot of municipalities across the country have looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15307)|
| 4:15:10| and I would just urge you and introduce this concept for you to think about in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15310)|
| 4:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15318)|
| 4:15:21| We have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15321)|
| 4:15:22| We can all check Nashville and the different cities and see if it's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15322)|
| 4:15:27| Of course, it will have to be put out for RFP if we decide to even go this route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15327)|
| 4:15:32| So I want to encourage each one of us to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15332)|
| 4:15:38| We need to go into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15338)|
| 4:15:39| We have two zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15339)|
| 4:15:42| Zoning is on page 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15342)|
| 4:15:49| I guess we need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15349)|

| 4:16:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15388)|
| 4:16:29| Eighteen members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15389)|
| 4:16:30| Eighteen commissioners are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15390)|
| 4:16:35| Zoning, 6B09RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15395)|
| 4:16:38| Request of Todd Kennedy for rezoning from A agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15398)|
| 4:16:43| at a density up to 7.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15403)|
| 4:16:47| Property located south side Cherokee Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15407)|
| 4:16:49| northwest of Eddington Road in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15409)|
| 4:16:53| The applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15413)|
| 4:16:56| Arthur Seymour, Jr., here on behalf of Mr. Kennedy, who is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15416)|
| 4:17:01| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15421)|
| 4:17:06| 9th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15426)|
| 4:17:07| We are asking for a small change, Mr. Chairman, from the MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15427)|
| 4:17:13| which was 4.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15433)|
| 4:17:16| We're asking for 6 units per acre, which is still well within the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15436)|
| 4:17:20| which calls for medium density residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15440)|
| 4:17:26| I haven't had anybody to contact me against this, anyone at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15446)|
| 4:17:30| and there's no opposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15450)|
| 4:17:31| So I would make a recommendation to approve it to 6.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15451)|
| 4:17:37| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15457)|
| 4:17:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15458)|
| 4:17:40| Do you have something, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15460)|
| 4:17:42| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15462)|
| 4:17:43| I'd like to add two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15463)|
| 4:17:46| As per our discussion, you did say six a minute ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15466)|
| 4:17:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15469)|
| 4:17:52| When I talked to Mr. Seymour, we looked at some other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15472)|
| 4:17:55| that he has some control over in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15475)|
| 4:18:00| They've given up a couple of pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15480)|
| 4:18:04| They've given up more units to the legacy parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15484)|
| 4:18:06| and a couple of other things there than what will be on this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15486)|
| 4:18:10| So it's a negative addition, a proposed addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15490)|
| 4:18:16| than what it could be by going with the six per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15496)|
| 4:18:19| plus the fact that if any of you all have been on Cherokee Trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15499)|
| 4:18:23| that one particular curve, you've got a flat spot around the curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15503)|
| 4:18:30| and then it heads skyward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15510)|
| 4:18:34| This developer has agreed to build only on the flat part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15514)|
| 4:18:38| Unless we get a great influx of mountain goats that they can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15518)|
| 4:18:42| and sell that top part to, it will be undeveloped and kept as green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15522)|
| 4:18:47| So I just want to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15527)|
| 4:18:49| And we will put a covenant down to ensure that that remains undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15529)|
| 4:18:54| And, Arthur, you are in agreement about this vegetation, no clearance until MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15534)|
| 4:18:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15539)|
| 4:19:01| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15541)|
| 4:19:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15543)|
| 4:19:04| So do we need to make sure that the motion includes that this is not low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15544)|
| 4:19:09| but medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15549)|
| 4:19:11| It's already the sector plan already shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15551)|
| 4:19:14| I know the sector plan may show that, but I think the zoning, Buzz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15554)|
| 4:19:20| does the motion need to show that this is a medium density instead of a low density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15560)|
| 4:19:28| Yes, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15568)|
| 4:19:29| The six DUs per acre is at the low end of the medium density range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15569)|
| 4:19:34| They did initially ask for 7.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15574)|
| 4:19:37| They shaved it down to 6.5 prior to the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15577)|
| 4:19:42| And then now they've requested 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15582)|
| 4:19:44| Of course, MPC had recommended 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15584)|
| 4:19:47| So it's consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15587)|
| 4:19:51| It's at the low end of the medium density range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15591)|
| 4:19:53| But I'm just wondering if they need to make their motion say that this is medium density at 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15593)|
| 4:19:58| instead of because this motion just says 4.5, which would be considered low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15598)|
| 4:20:03| Right, 4.5 would be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15603)|
| 4:20:05| So if you want to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15605)|
| 4:20:07| We can add that to it if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15607)|
| 4:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15608)|

| 4:20:12| So you did make the change, Commissioner Pinkson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15612)|
| 4:20:15| I didn't think there would be any need in it, but that's all right to put it in medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15615)|

| 4:20:33| Motion carries 17 yes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15633)|

| 4:21:18| Commissioner, Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15678)|
| 4:21:20| We spoke to Vulcan Materials and also spoke to Dr. Keith Kirkpatrick, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15680)|
| 4:21:27| and they had a meeting and went before the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15687)|
| 4:21:29| They're doing some extraordinary pre-blast engineering on some homes around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15689)|
| 4:21:39| They've made some concessions to build a berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15699)|
| 4:21:42| and the berm will only get larger, if I'm not mistaken, as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15702)|
| 4:21:45| And so the community has met with Vulcan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15705)|
| 4:21:48| and they have made concessions and the community will be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15708)|
| 4:21:54| I just want to make sure that Vulcan understands that we'll hold them to that, and they've agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15714)|
| 4:21:59| I'd like to make a motion to approve based on MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15719)|

| 4:22:17| Commissioner Brown, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15737)|
| 4:22:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15740)|
| 4:22:21| We have a motion on the floor to approve all in favor of per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15741)|

| 4:22:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15779)|
| 4:23:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15780)|
| 4:23:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15781)|

| 4:23:14| Ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15794)|
| 4:23:16| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15796)|
| 4:23:18| Yeah, let's take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15798)|
| 4:23:22| When we come back, we're going to page 22906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15802)|
| 4:23:26| We got a new person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15806)|
| 4:23:57| I think that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15837)|
| 4:24:09| On page 22, this is resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15849)|
| 4:24:16| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15856)|
| 4:24:20| Sections 2 and 5 of the Knox County Code of Ethics Relative to the Disclosure of Personal Interest in Voting Matters and Nepotism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15860)|
| 4:24:28| respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15868)|
| 4:24:32| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15872)|
| 4:24:33| In order to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15873)|
| 4:24:34| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15874)|
| 4:24:36| 8-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15876)|
| 4:24:40| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15880)|
| 4:24:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15881)|
| 4:24:43| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15883)|
| 4:24:45| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15885)|
| 4:24:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15889)|
| 4:24:51| What is this going to do exactly that we're not already doing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15891)|
| 4:24:55| All right, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15895)|
| 4:24:57| Let me pull this up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15897)|
| 4:25:00| I just about have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15900)|
| 4:25:01| Really, what happened is there's two parts to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15901)|
| 4:25:06| The previous ethics policy dealt, I'm trying to get this thing up here on the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15906)|
| 4:25:16| dealt with what happens when there is a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15916)|
| 4:25:19| And under the old policy, you could, and we had this come up at one of our meetings, you could discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15919)|
| 4:25:25| but you could not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15925)|
| 4:25:27| Under the present charter amendment that passed last November, once you identify a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15927)|
| 4:25:33| you don't participate in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15933)|
| 4:25:35| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15935)|
| 4:25:37| The other thing that it does, it's not only on elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15937)|
| 4:25:42| but it's also on all officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15942)|
| 4:25:44| If there's a conflict of interest where there's either a nepotism issue, you can't be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15944)|
| 4:25:50| And there's a definition of what nepotism is, and there's a list of all the relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15950)|
| 4:25:56| That means parents, staff, parent, foster parent, parent-in-law, and it goes on and on and on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15956)|
| 4:26:00| And what it does, it brings the ethics policy in compliance with the charter amendment that passed in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15960)|
| 4:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15966)|
| 4:26:07| How does this affect votes on commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15967)|
| 4:26:10| And here's what I'm worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15970)|
| 4:26:15| If we have to abstain where there's a conflict, an abstention counts as a no because it's not a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15975)|
| 4:26:26| And what I'm afraid of is that at some point, being a student of politics, studying it for years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15986)|
| 4:26:35| folks will try to find things to use to their advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15995)|
| 4:26:39| So on a close vote, if it forces a person not to vote at all, then it forces the person to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=15999)|
| 4:26:49| And what I'm afraid of is that it will become a tactic to where people will try to, if they want to kill something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16009)|
| 4:26:57| instead of killing it with no votes, they'll try to kill it by finding conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16017)|
| 4:27:02| Will this still allow a vote after you've disclosed the conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16022)|
| 4:27:06| What we vote on today, I mean, this isn't arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16026)|
| 4:27:09| This is law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16029)|
| 4:27:10| This is charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16030)|
| 4:27:11| This is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16031)|
| 4:27:12| It's just that the ethics policy read different because until this passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16032)|
| 4:27:18| what I'm saying is that we have about a six-month lag between what the charter says and what the ethics policy says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16038)|
| 4:27:25| and we're just making them all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16047)|
| 4:27:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16048)|
| 4:27:29| But this does not affect the votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16049)|
| 4:27:31| This is already a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16051)|
| 4:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16055)|
| 4:27:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16056)|
| 4:27:39| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16059)|
| 4:27:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16060)|
| 4:27:42| Can we still disclose and vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16062)|
| 4:27:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16065)|
| 4:27:46| And you cannot disclose and discuss either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16066)|
| 4:27:49| Well, can you discuss before you disclose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16069)|
| 4:27:55| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16075)|
| 4:27:58| You can read the amendment and ask the law director for an interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16078)|
| 4:28:03| No, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16083)|
| 4:28:04| Lumpy is telling you the truth, and if you can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| You're supposed to make a disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16088)|
| 4:28:10| I understand that, but if you can't vote the way it is now, we can make a disclosure and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16090)|
| 4:28:15| No, I don't think you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16095)|
| 4:28:17| You can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16097)|
| 4:28:18| I think that's what the state constitution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16098)|
| 4:28:20| That's the way it was prior to Amendment 3 passing back in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16100)|
| 4:28:25| Yes, we went through this discussion, I think, at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16105)|
| 4:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16110)|
| 4:28:31| Well, here's the funny thing about the way this thing is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16111)|
| 4:28:35| If it's a charter amendment, we may not have a way of fixing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16115)|
| 4:28:38| but a person can go out and say, okay, here's this ordinance on whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16118)|
| 4:28:46| and so I'm going to find a way to conflict everyone on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16126)|
| 4:28:52| or conflict ten people so they can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16132)|
| 4:28:55| You could have something that's good for Knox County that people want to vote for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16135)|
| 4:29:00| yet some crafty lobbyist could study all of our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16140)|
| 4:29:05| and find a way to cause ten of us to be forced to abstain because of a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16145)|
| 4:29:16| and forced not to even engage in the discussion because of a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16156)|
| 4:29:22| and kill something that we may all want to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16162)|
| 4:29:32| It doesn't set up for good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16172)|
| 4:29:35| And I'm thinking as a politician with an agenda and with desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16175)|
| 4:29:41| I can already think of a dozen ways I could use this to my advantage if I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16181)|
| 4:29:48| But it's still not good government to use a conflict to force folks not to vote on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16188)|
| 4:29:57| Actually, I don't think it's forcing anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16197)|
| 4:29:59| What the amendment says is that anything, and I'm going to use this word because it's in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16199)|
| 4:30:03| anything that would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the official's vote on the measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16203)|
| 4:30:09| probably the referee on that would be the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16209)|
| 4:30:13| And then to answer Commissioner Pinkston's question about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16213)|
| 4:30:19| as it said that the person must disclose during the meeting at which the vote takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16219)|
| 4:30:25| before any discussion or vote on the measure that it appears that there's a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16225)|
| 4:30:30| After that point, the said elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16230)|
| 4:30:33| or employee shall recuse himself from the discussion and or the vote on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16233)|
| 4:30:39| And then that's section two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16239)|
| 4:30:41| Section five defines what nepotism is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16241)|
| 4:30:43| But Mr. Briggs, Commissioner Briggs, say Mr. Norman, is your wife still a schoolteacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16243)|
| 4:30:52| Is that going to eliminate him from voting on anything that schools have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16252)|
| 4:30:57| I'm not the legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16257)|
| 4:30:59| I'm not going to give a legal opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16259)|
| 4:31:01| I think it's what a reasonable person would say, you know, according to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16261)|
| 4:31:06| We've talked about this on the commission every time we vote on anything that deals with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16266)|
| 4:31:10| because we're county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16270)|
| 4:31:12| And I think we've had an explanation of that from the law director that was down here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16272)|
| 4:31:16| That's up to the law directors to decide what we can and can't do if that question comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16276)|
| 4:31:22| And, again, it's what a reasonable person would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16282)|
| 4:31:26| And I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16286)|
| 4:31:28| I think I'm still recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16288)|
| 4:31:29| A reasonable person would say that if you're married and you have combined incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16289)|
| 4:31:36| which most married folks do, I think that's the way the Bible says you're supposed to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16296)|
| 4:31:41| is that you combine all your assets and become like a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16301)|
| 4:31:46| I think a reasonable man would say that if your wife has a county job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16306)|
| 4:31:53| that the budget is going to reflect that effect because of her pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16313)|
| 4:32:00| then using that standard a good many of us would have to abstain and essentially vote no on a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16320)|
| 4:32:11| And it's going to be awful hard to pass a budget that has any kind of contention to it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16331)|
| 4:32:18| Let me just say, I'm not advocating for or against it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16338)|
| 4:32:21| We're trying to say is that we have to have our ethics policy in compliance with the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16341)|
| 4:32:27| This is what the voters voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16347)|
| 4:32:29| It's part of the charter now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| We had the same discussion last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| The voters voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16353)|
| 4:32:34| It's in the charter right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16354)|
| 4:32:36| All we're doing with this is making the ethics policy in compliance with the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16356)|
| 4:32:41| That's all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16361)|
| 4:32:45| I mean, if we want to change it, we can vote to put this back on and vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16365)|
| 4:32:49| Let the citizens vote on it again if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16369)|
| 4:32:53| Let me ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16373)|
| 4:32:54| I realize what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16374)|
| 4:32:56| I'm not saying I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16376)|
| 4:32:57| But in our budget, lots of times county employees get a two percent raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16377)|
| 4:33:03| That includes you and me and every commissioner sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16383)|
| 4:33:07| Can we vote for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16387)|
| 4:33:10| We all benefit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16390)|
| 4:33:11| We benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16391)|
| 4:33:12| Can we vote for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16392)|
| 4:33:15| I think what you forget is the explanation that Bill Lockett gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16395)|
| 4:33:18| It was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16398)|
| 4:33:19| I think there's some principle that's ‑‑ I forget what the principle was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16399)|
| 4:33:24| but he said that there was not a problem doing it with it because you can grind absolutely to a halt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16404)|
| 4:33:29| where you can't do anything if you use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16409)|
| 4:33:32| Bill Lockett explained that very well once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16412)|
| 4:33:34| Well, if you look at the language, first of all, we have to be clear, this is the law already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16414)|
| 4:33:38| Regardless if you morph it into your ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16418)|
| 4:33:42| the ethics committee is going to have to follow it because it is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16422)|
| 4:33:45| But it does read in the middle of the paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16425)|
| 4:33:47| this provision shall not be applicable to voting on measures for reapportionment of districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16427)|
| 4:33:52| or other measures that affect all members of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16432)|
| 4:33:56| A budget would affect all members of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16436)|
| 4:33:58| even if you were newer, some benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16438)|
| 4:34:01| But, again, I have to reiterate, it is the law already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16441)|
| 4:34:04| So you can ignore it, but it's still going to be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16444)|
| 4:34:07| And if I advise the ethics committee, this is what I'm going to have to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16447)|
| 4:34:15| Are you finished, Commissioner Lockett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16455)|
| 4:34:16| Well, it's ‑‑ I mean, yeah, I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16456)|
| 4:34:19| I'm figuring out ways that I can really use this to my advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16459)|
| 4:34:23| And so if that's the way it is, then I've got a nifty little trick up my sleeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16463)|
| 4:34:30| Again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16470)|
| 4:34:31| Make a motion to approve or did we have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16471)|
| 4:34:33| Now you're not told, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16473)|
| 4:34:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16477)|
| 4:34:39| Commissioner Lambert, I agree with what you're saying as far as the forced no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16479)|
| 4:34:45| It is what the people have passed, and I agree with the law director and Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16485)|
| 4:34:51| This is, you know, whether we vote for this or against this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16491)|
| 4:34:55| it doesn't change what the law of the land is as far as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16495)|
| 4:35:00| But one thing you've got to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16500)|
| 4:35:02| the only way to make a change is with positive votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16502)|
| 4:35:07| So if you can't vote yes, you can't make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16507)|
| 4:35:10| A no vote doesn't affect the outcome of whether something passes or doesn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16510)|
| 4:35:17| It's how many yes votes to make a change in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16517)|
| 4:35:22| And it could be a very good change that may lose some yes votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16522)|
| 4:35:27| because people may have to abstain from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16527)|
| 4:35:31| What about if it keeps you from getting a ten vote margin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16531)|
| 4:35:34| Then it would not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16534)|
| 4:35:36| It dies if it doesn't get the number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16536)|
| 4:35:39| That's what Mr. Lambert's been saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16539)|
| 4:35:41| Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16541)|
| 4:35:42| I mean, this is when, you know, in the political game, when you're playing defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16542)|
| 4:35:48| when there's something that comes up and you want to block it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16548)|
| 4:35:52| all you have to do is examine each person here and their lives and their assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16552)|
| 4:35:59| and try to find some way to conflict them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16559)|
| 4:36:02| Because if you can come up and conflict them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16562)|
| 4:36:05| then you can force them to vote no whether they want to or not by forcing them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16565)|
| 4:36:10| or by enlightening them to the point that they actually have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16570)|
| 4:36:18| Once that conflict of interest has been exposed, then they're forced to abstain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16578)|
| 4:36:24| which means they're forced to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16584)|
| 4:36:27| And they are no longer allowed to represent the folks that they were elected to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16587)|
| 4:36:33| Because you can't even vote, you can't discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16593)|
| 4:36:35| and they're no longer representing the folks in their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16595)|
| 4:36:40| especially with going down to one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16600)|
| 4:36:45| When you have to abstain, everybody in that district is no longer represented on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16605)|
| 4:36:50| No longer represented, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16610)|
| 4:36:55| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16615)|
| 4:36:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16617)|
| 4:36:58| If mine is the only light on, I'll turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16618)|
| 4:37:03| We have a motion on the floor to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16625)|
| 4:37:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16627)|
| 4:37:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16628)|
| 4:37:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16631)|
| 4:37:13| 80908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16633)|
| 4:37:15| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16635)|
| 4:37:18| requesting that the Knox County Commission initiate an ouster lawsuit against Knox County Law Director William S. Lockett, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16638)|
| 4:37:27| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16647)|
| 4:37:28| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16648)|
| 4:37:30| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16650)|
| 4:37:31| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16651)|
| 4:37:33| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16653)|
| 4:37:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16658)|
| 4:37:39| This really was here as sort of a place saver if we needed or felt the need to do quick action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16659)|
| 4:37:45| If we are satisfied with the actions of ouster suits or the Board of Professional Responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16665)|
| 4:37:52| then simply I would suggest the proper form would be if we are satisfied it's the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16672)|
| 4:37:56| And then if we feel the need in the future, we can take it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16676)|
| 4:37:59| So I would let others make that choice, but this was here as a place saver if we were upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16679)|
| 4:38:06| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16686)|
| 4:38:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16687)|
| 4:38:08| Would it not have the same effect if you just simply withdraw and then at any time you could always bring it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16688)|
| 4:38:14| You could withdraw or reintroduce or table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16694)|
| 4:38:16| It would mean the same thing, and I don't care which form it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16696)|
| 4:38:20| Would you like to go ahead and withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16700)|
| 4:38:22| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16702)|
| 4:38:24| Yeah, I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16704)|
| 4:38:25| Because you could bring it back at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16705)|
| 4:38:27| I'm getting a lot of nods that they would like to withdraw, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16707)|
| 4:38:30| We can do that that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16710)|
| 4:38:31| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16711)|
| 4:38:32| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16712)|

| 4:39:12| and cost of medical insurance, and so that the commission of Knox County would create an insurance committee designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16752)|
| 4:39:19| to keep employees abreast of and informed as to the cost, the types of coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16759)|
| 4:39:25| and potential changes to their medical insurance benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16765)|
| 4:39:29| And what this committee needed to be formed of was actually 11 members, one from the public defender's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16769)|
| 4:39:39| two from the sheriff's department, two from the mayor's office, one county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16779)|
| 4:39:44| one from the register of deeds office, one from criminal clerk's office, one from the circuit clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16784)|
| 4:39:50| and one from the property assessor's office, and one from the county clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16790)|
| 4:39:55| and one from the district attorney's office, and one from the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16795)|
| 4:40:03| So I'd make a motion that we would move to accept for the commission to elect a committee for the employees to be represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16803)|
| 4:40:11| on their insurance benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16811)|
| 4:40:18| We already have the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16818)|
| 4:40:23| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16823)|
| 4:40:24| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16824)|
| 4:40:29| Do you all accept for Commissioner Carringer, representative of the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16829)|
| 4:40:37| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16837)|
| 4:40:39| Can you explain that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16839)|
| 4:40:42| What's the difference, Ms. Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16842)|
| 4:40:44| Right now the employees themselves do not have any representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16844)|
| 4:40:51| and we're just asking that each department has a representation for their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16851)|
| 4:41:01| Each department has a representative on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16861)|
| 4:41:03| That's what we're asking for, for each office to have a representative of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16863)|
| 4:41:08| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16868)|
| 4:41:09| You know, Mr. Carringer, I believe every time our insurance discussion comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16869)|
| 4:41:15| every department has appointed someone, they come down here and talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16875)|
| 4:41:18| I know Tim Wheeler, Nick McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16878)|
| 4:41:20| Well, see, they thought that they were permanently appointed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16880)|
| 4:41:24| Oh, I thought the departments picked their representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16884)|
| 4:41:26| No, they were found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16886)|
| 4:41:28| No, that is not a permanent committee to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16888)|
| 4:41:33| They have to just take that up on their own after something has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16893)|
| 4:41:37| This would be a committee formed in advance so that they would be informed of all the changes their insurance would have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16897)|
| 4:41:46| and then they could come to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16906)|
| 4:41:48| But when you see all these different ones coming from different offices, that's not a formed committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16908)|
| 4:41:53| Okay, I just thought that the offices picked the person they wanted to come down and represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16913)|
| 4:42:00| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16920)|
| 4:42:01| Yes, Commissioner Carringer, how long is this committee for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16921)|
| 4:42:04| Is it a year-long term, or how long would the appointments be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16924)|
| 4:42:08| Well, I mean, in my opinion, I think all the employees, it should be a committee that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16928)|
| 4:42:13| if commission wants to do it on a yearly basis or however they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16933)|
| 4:42:18| But I think all the employees should have a representation of what their employees are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16938)|
| 4:42:25| So that's something we could set up as to whether or not we wanted to do it for a three-year term or a one-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16945)|
| 4:42:34| But we just wanted to make sure that the employees had a permanent committee from all these offices representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16954)|
| 4:42:42| Yeah, you said that the purpose here is to inform, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16962)|
| 4:42:47| So this would be more of a, okay, here's what's going on with your insurance, if the premiums are going to go up, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16967)|
| 4:42:53| Now, would they kind of be more, do you envision them being kind of a bargaining group that would go to, say, us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16973)|
| 4:43:00| and others and say, on behalf, here's what we would like, we'd like our insurance changed, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16980)|
| 4:43:06| As well, I mean, like I think they're in a three-year contract right now with Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16986)|
| 4:43:12| I think there's another year left on that current contract right now with their health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16992)|
| 4:43:19| What kind of prompted this was, well, first of all, this committee are the ones that Paul was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=16999)|
| 4:43:26| different ones that came from different offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17006)|
| 4:43:28| They thought they were permanently elected by county commission about, what, two years ago when they first went over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17008)|
| 4:43:35| and come to find out, looking back in minutes, they were not permanently elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17015)|
| 4:43:38| It was just for a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17018)|
| 4:43:41| All of the fee offices got billed $900 per employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17021)|
| 4:43:50| Some of them were billed just a few weeks ago, like came up with $30,000 per office of being short for their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17030)|
| 4:43:59| Now, this is primarily insurance or would there be other benefits as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17039)|
| 4:44:02| Is this a benefits committee or an insurance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17042)|
| 4:44:04| This would just be for the insurance committee, their medical insurance and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17044)|
| 4:44:11| If I might suggest that this be on a yearly basis, I mean, you could do it for three years, but, well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17051)|
| 4:44:20| You might want to have it more than a year because you get on a committee, you start learning things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17060)|
| 4:44:23| It might be like a two-year or maybe summer for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17063)|
| 4:44:26| Anyway, this is your, I just make that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17066)|
| 4:44:29| Also, John Troyer is at the podium looking like he would like to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17069)|
| 4:44:32| and I'd like to give you that opportunity while I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17072)|
| 4:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17074)|
| 4:44:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17075)|
| 4:44:36| I just want to report that I have spoken with Frances Fogerson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17076)|
| 4:44:39| who administers the benefits through Human Resources Department, and she supports this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17079)|
| 4:44:47| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17087)|
| 4:44:50| And it might be, you know, maybe we ought to think about, I think, doing it more than a year because, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17090)|
| 4:44:55| I think next year their contract comes up with Cigna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17095)|
| 4:44:59| so if the group starts now in their form, then they would be the ones getting in on whatever new insurance policies change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17099)|
| 4:45:07| or whatever, so maybe a two-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17107)|
| 4:45:12| I'll leave that up to the, well, I'll just make a motion then for a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17112)|
| 4:45:18| Well, someone else made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17118)|
| 4:45:20| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17120)|
| 4:45:22| Can I do a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17122)|
| 4:45:25| Two-year term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17125)|
| 4:45:26| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17126)|
| 4:45:27| Three-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17127)|
| 4:45:28| Three-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17128)|
| 4:45:31| Can I do a friendly amendment that these terms be two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17131)|
| 4:45:35| and that each department and each fee office pick their own representative that would be serving on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17135)|
| 4:45:45| And not have to run it back through us, just let them pick their own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17145)|
| 4:45:48| It gives them a little credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17148)|
| 4:45:51| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17151)|
| 4:45:54| How does Tony Norman accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17154)|
| 4:45:56| I'll accept it if Ms. Carringer accepts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17156)|
| 4:45:59| I'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17159)|
| 4:46:00| I'll second and accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17160)|
| 4:46:03| Craig, you're the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17163)|
| 4:46:05| Well, let me get this right, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17165)|
| 4:46:08| Because I'm trying to make sense of this term because let's say the clerk's office appoints employee A to be on this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17168)|
| 4:46:19| and they're on there this year, and then next year when they're going to basically meet again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17179)|
| 4:46:25| then the clerk is going to appoint not even have it, that employee A has to be it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17185)|
| 4:46:32| or could the clerk appoint employee B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17192)|
| 4:46:37| I think the office holder will appoint someone for two years, I think is what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17197)|
| 4:46:45| So if that office holder thinks that it should change, they can't change it from one year to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17205)|
| 4:46:55| Well, I believe Mr. Brown's friendly amendment was that the people in that office vote for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17215)|
| 4:47:04| The office holder doesn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17224)|
| 4:47:06| Well, I don't know that the people in the office, that's not what the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17226)|
| 4:47:09| that's not within this resolution that the office will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17229)|
| 4:47:13| That was his amendment, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17233)|
| 4:47:15| That the people in that office will vote for their representative and then they come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17235)|
| 4:47:20| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17240)|
| 4:47:23| My question is, getting back to my original question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17243)|
| 4:47:26| what I've turned my light on is at what point of the process will this committee get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17246)|
| 4:47:35| when the mayor's office or whoever starts discussing next year's plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17255)|
| 4:47:41| how much are the costs going to be, what are the benefits going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17261)|
| 4:47:45| the premiums that are going to be charged to the employee, how much the county is going to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17265)|
| 4:47:51| At what time will they be informed and be part of this process instead of it just being here it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17271)|
| 4:47:59| and next month the county commission is going to hear this and they don't have much of a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17279)|
| 4:48:06| Well, no, what this is set up to be is that they would be in on it at the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17286)|
| 4:48:12| when they start negotiating and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17292)|
| 4:48:15| Okay, is that within your resolution somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17295)|
| 4:48:18| Well, it's that we hereby, Knox County hereby creates an insurance committee designed to keep employees abreast of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17298)|
| 4:48:27| and informed as to the cost, types of coverage and potential changes to their medical insurance benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17307)|
| 4:48:35| So when they start doing contracts and all, that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17315)|
| 4:48:38| that would definitely fall under potential changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17318)|
| 4:48:43| I just want to make sure that they are kept abreast and informed because too many years in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17323)|
| 4:48:49| I know Tim Wheeler has come down here and said, you know, this is about the first we've heard of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17329)|
| 4:48:56| and we haven't had a chance to really study it or make any changes to it or suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17336)|
| 4:49:03| And I just want to make sure that when we do this committee that they're kept informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17343)|
| 4:49:09| and kept in the loop so that if there are changes, it comes with their, I don't know about blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17349)|
| 4:49:16| but at least have passed it and said, yes, we recognize these changes have to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17356)|
| 4:49:21| Well, let me ask along Director Joe Jarrett on there because he was in the committee with us when we were forming this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17361)|
| 4:49:28| It was to my understanding that they would be at the very beginning of any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17368)|
| 4:49:34| Was that yours or do we need to make a little amendment to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17374)|
| 4:49:38| Yes, Commissioner and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17378)|
| 4:49:39| That was their desire, that they would be kept abreast from the inception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17379)|
| 4:49:43| so they would have an ongoing knowledge of any potential changes in their benefits, costs, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17383)|
| 4:49:48| and not ultimately in the end be surprised that they're either losing a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17388)|
| 4:49:53| or paying a greater premium for a benefit they heretofore enjoyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17393)|
| 4:49:56| So for your legal advice, do you feel like we are correct on this wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17396)|
| 4:50:02| or do we need to change a few words to make sure that it is with everybody's understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17402)|
| 4:50:08| that they are going to be in on it from the very beginning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17408)|
| 4:50:12| We need to add the amendment words in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17412)|
| 4:50:14| Do you think it's okay the way it's stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17414)|
| 4:50:17| I think there have been several iterations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17417)|
| 4:50:20| If I can hear the final proposal, that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17420)|
| 4:50:25| Well, basically the way it is, we want to make sure that we form this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17425)|
| 4:50:29| but they're in on it from the very beginning when contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17429)|
| 4:50:33| and different companies come in bidding for the medical insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17433)|
| 4:50:38| That's certainly appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17438)|
| 4:50:40| So the way it's worded right now, does that serve that purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17440)|
| 4:50:46| But you need to add the amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17446)|
| 4:50:49| Of the two-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17449)|
| 4:50:51| Plus each department will pick their own representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17451)|
| 4:50:56| Well, you've got to make sure that now each department picking that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17456)|
| 4:51:00| Each office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17460)|
| 4:51:01| Is that the office holder or is it the employees voting on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17461)|
| 4:51:04| Each office and their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17464)|
| 4:51:07| Let's specify that the employees of each department will vote on who their representative will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17467)|
| 4:51:12| This is kind of like a front line offense and defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17472)|
| 4:51:17| My next question is, let's say this committee votes against whatever changes may occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17477)|
| 4:51:26| It probably doesn't bind this commission to anything or even the administration to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17486)|
| 4:51:34| It won't come with their seal of approval before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17494)|
| 4:51:38| and then commission can either vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17498)|
| 4:51:41| They're looking for a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17501)|
| 4:51:42| They obviously know they don't have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17502)|
| 4:51:43| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17503)|
| 4:51:44| I just want to make sure they have a voice, an informed voice, and a timely voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17504)|
| 4:51:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17510)|
| 4:51:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17511)|
| 4:51:55| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17515)|
| 4:51:58| Ultimately, the commission and the human resources department determine what is proposed and voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17518)|
| 4:52:04| What are these individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17524)|
| 4:52:06| I want them to have a voice also and have an opinion, but what are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17526)|
| 4:52:10| Are they just going to vote and will recognize their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17530)|
| 4:52:13| Is that what the resolution calls for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17533)|
| 4:52:16| Exactly, that they have, that the employees have a representation in what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17536)|
| 4:52:21| and how they feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17541)|
| 4:52:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17543)|
| 4:52:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17545)|
| 4:52:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17546)|
| 4:52:27| I had talked to Francis about this a little bit, and, John, you may want to chime in some, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17547)|
| 4:52:32| if you're privy to this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17552)|
| 4:52:35| Michelle, one thing that they were concerned with a little bit is having all the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17555)|
| 4:52:39| and the employees don't mind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17559)|
| 4:52:40| You know, that's what we've always had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17560)|
| 4:52:42| By the way, I just want to remind everybody that Knox County has four choices for health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17562)|
| 4:52:48| I sell health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17568)|
| 4:52:49| Guys, you don't put four plans of health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17569)|
| 4:52:52| And so our employees are, they've got a Cadillac of the Cadillac plans out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17572)|
| 4:52:57| But one thing we sort of need to be leery of or watch, and I think Brad sort of hit on it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17577)|
| 4:53:02| is that this concern for Francis was that, well, what if all those, quote, employees decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17582)|
| 4:53:08| we want Knox County to pay for all of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17588)|
| 4:53:11| You know, that's what we have to sort of be leery of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17591)|
| 4:53:15| They don't have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17595)|
| 4:53:17| Don't give them the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17597)|
| 4:53:18| That's what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17598)|
| 4:53:19| What if they vote against any change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17599)|
| 4:53:21| Well, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17601)|
| 4:53:22| It doesn't bind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17602)|
| 4:53:23| It's just that it doesn't come with their seal of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17603)|
| 4:53:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17605)|
| 4:53:26| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17606)|
| 4:53:27| Right now, Knox County pays 90%, and the employee pays 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17607)|
| 4:53:33| But the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17613)|
| 4:53:36| It depends on what plan you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17616)|
| 4:53:38| Well, there's four plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17618)|
| 4:53:40| John, is it 90-10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17620)|
| 4:53:44| You're talking about premiums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17624)|
| 4:53:47| Are you talking about the cost of the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17627)|
| 4:53:51| To put them together, round numbers, it's about 90-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17631)|
| 4:53:55| And it varies plan to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17635)|
| 4:53:57| And so of the four plans, two are making money, two are losing money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17637)|
| 4:54:00| and that's part of what we're going to need the employees' input on is how are we going to best address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17640)|
| 4:54:05| And so we certainly want to embrace the idea, get the employees' input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17645)|
| 4:54:10| and have a responsible proposal for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17650)|
| 4:54:14| And let me also add that all the fee offices pay that 90% out of the fees that they collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17654)|
| 4:54:24| So that's not the same as Knox County tax dollars going to pay that insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17664)|
| 4:54:32| You know, that's the fee offices themselves that have to have that much money in there to pay that 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17672)|
| 4:54:38| So they were all SS $900 per employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17678)|
| 4:54:45| So that added up quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17685)|
| 4:54:46| So they just want to be in there and have a say-so as to how the insurance benefits are changing and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17686)|
| 4:54:57| Commissioner, you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17697)|
| 4:55:00| Does the employee have a vote or is that just a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17700)|
| 4:55:03| just go along and show people what they got or will they vote on what they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17703)|
| 4:55:06| Well, the one person representing that office holder, take, for instance, Fred Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17706)|
| 4:55:12| He would have one person representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17712)|
| 4:55:15| And they would have their committee where they would hopefully meet, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17715)|
| 4:55:19| with the human resource, everybody that's dealing with the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17719)|
| 4:55:24| So they'd have a vote on what type of plan they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17724)|
| 4:55:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17727)|
| 4:55:30| We have a motion on the floor to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17730)|
| 4:55:33| Just one point of information, Mr. Chairman and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17733)|
| 4:55:36| We're trying to survey our employees now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17736)|
| 4:55:38| We put out an Internet survey, and we're asking about 10 or 12 questions that are real specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17738)|
| 4:55:44| But what we're dealing with, two plans are losing money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17744)|
| 4:55:49| and the other two plans are subsidizing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17749)|
| 4:55:53| So we're asking questions like, should two plans subsidize other plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17753)|
| 4:55:57| And would you rather pay more for more benefits or less for less benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17757)|
| 4:56:03| But I guess what we've got to remember, two of these plans are already losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17763)|
| 4:56:08| And if benefits don't go down, premiums are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17768)|
| 4:56:11| And we've got to remember the reality of the insurance world now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17771)|
| 4:56:14| And this is a rich plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17774)|
| 4:56:18| So when we get the survey results, we'll share it with Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17778)|
| 4:56:22| Mr. Arms, are we overall, are we in the red or the black?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17782)|
| 4:56:31| Barely in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17791)|
| 4:56:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17792)|
| 4:56:35| Do you have something else, Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17795)|
| 4:56:38| Well, I just wanted to make, with the four plans, you've got the two that are losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17798)|
| 4:56:44| Those are your two top plans, which basically are family plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17804)|
| 4:56:50| And then you've got your two lower ones that are, those are, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17810)|
| 4:56:56| probably most single people, young and healthy single people that are taking a gamble, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17816)|
| 4:57:02| of having a $2,500 deductible per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17822)|
| 4:57:05| They're gambling on not getting sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17825)|
| 4:57:07| That's what insurance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17827)|
| 4:57:09| You know, so obviously your two top plans that are dealing with families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17829)|
| 4:57:14| and all people that are paying more, those are losing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17834)|
| 4:57:18| Because that's, let's face it, those are the people that's got diabetes, high blood pressure and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17838)|
| 4:57:24| They're the ones using the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17844)|
| 4:57:28| Why did you look at me when you said that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17848)|
| 4:57:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17850)|
| 4:57:34| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17854)|
| 4:57:36| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17856)|
| 4:57:37| Yeah, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17857)|
| 4:57:39| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17859)|
| 4:57:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17861)|
| 4:57:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17863)|
| 4:57:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17864)|
| 4:57:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17865)|
| 4:57:47| No, no, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17867)|
| 4:57:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17869)|
| 4:57:50| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17870)|
| 4:57:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17871)|
| 4:57:56| You said one person from commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17876)|
| 4:58:00| Yeah, I mean, do we need to choose that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17880)|
| 4:58:03| I thought we agreed that it would be Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17883)|
| 4:58:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17885)|
| 4:58:07| I thought she volunteered earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17887)|
| 4:58:09| Did she volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17889)|
| 4:58:10| I'll be more than glad to be on it since I do not have Knox County medical insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17890)|
| 4:58:18| so I do not have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17898)|
| 4:58:24| Granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17904)|
| 4:58:25| Commissioner Carringer will be our representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17905)|
| 4:58:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17909)|
| 4:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17910)|
| 4:58:31| I'd like to turn it over to our Lyle Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17911)|
| 4:58:34| I'll try to keep this to a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17914)|
| 4:58:35| Members of the Board, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17915)|
| 4:58:38| It may not be obvious, but Commissioner Amy Broyles has been monitoring the meeting today by telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17918)|
| 4:58:44| because she has several commitments with the NACO conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17924)|
| 4:58:47| Our hope was that she'd actually be able to deliberate and vote by phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17927)|
| 4:58:51| because there's a Tennessee code annotated section that reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17931)|
| 4:58:55| a governing body may permit this provided there's a physical quorum presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17935)|
| 4:58:59| Further, your rules, although silent to this, defer to Robert's rules, which likewise permit telephonic voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17939)|
| 4:59:05| However, unfortunately, as I continue to research this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17945)|
| 4:59:09| the Attorney General has ruled that although despite the plain meaning of the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17949)|
| 4:59:14| it was never the legislative intent for it to apply to counties, only to cities, oddly enough, and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17954)|
| 4:59:20| So my point is Commissioner Broyles had every intention of being afforded the opportunity to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17960)|

| 4:59:27| But, again, unfortunately, state law does not permit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17967)|
| 4:59:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17971)|

| 4:59:47| implementing a Knox County vehicle use policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17987)|

| 4:59:54| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17994)|
| 4:59:55| I don't know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17995)|

| 4:59:59| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=17999)|
| 5:00:00| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18000)|
| 5:00:03| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18003)|
| 5:00:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18004)|
| 5:00:09| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18009)|
| 5:00:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18011)|
| 5:00:12| Which Harmon are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18012)|
| 5:00:14| Both lads are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18014)|
| 5:00:18| I suppose I'll start, Ivan, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18018)|
| 5:00:19| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18019)|
| 5:00:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18020)|
| 5:00:22| I'd like to speak briefly about the purpose of this resolution, express some gratitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18022)|
| 5:00:28| and relay some important specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18028)|
| 5:00:31| The purpose of this resolution is to have an efficient, clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18031)|
| 5:00:35| and consistent policy based on best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18035)|
| 5:00:38| And if we do that, and I think we can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18038)|
| 5:00:41| then we're likely to save the taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18041)|
| 5:00:44| And that's my hope and expectation and really one of my highest purposes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18044)|
| 5:00:48| We've gone through a very long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18048)|
| 5:00:51| We first created a fleet policy 364 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18051)|
| 5:00:58| And we've gone through a lot of things, and there are a lot of people to thank for their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18058)|
| 5:01:03| The mayor has presented to us twice now some policies that have been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18063)|
| 5:01:08| but never formally voted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18068)|
| 5:01:10| The sheriff has forwarded some departmental memos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18070)|
| 5:01:15| Both have had persons represented at our vehicles meetings who participated very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18075)|
| 5:01:22| and offered great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18082)|
| 5:01:25| Commissioner Hammond came through recognizing the value of not just ad hoc changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18085)|
| 5:01:29| but a complete policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18089)|
| 5:01:31| Commissioner Lambert recommended some changes regarding judicial offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18091)|
| 5:01:34| which I hope he continues in that line and presents as a separate policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18094)|
| 5:01:39| I think it's very worthy of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18099)|
| 5:01:42| The law director's office came through with a sort of best practices of other places memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18102)|
| 5:01:51| And departments of county government have been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18111)|
| 5:01:54| IT on its own cut back from nine to five vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18114)|
| 5:01:58| The property assessor got rid of token vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18118)|
| 5:02:01| The sheriff's office has promised to scale back future vehicle requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18121)|
| 5:02:06| All of those for which I am extremely grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18126)|
| 5:02:08| I think it's gotten us to the point where we can pass what I think is a good policy before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18128)|
| 5:02:13| Well, you see, as amended, what happened was I took the policy that has been around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18133)|
| 5:02:19| but has never been formally voted upon by this body, and it's in italics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18139)|
| 5:02:23| and added it to the policy that I generated out of those many things that came out of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18143)|
| 5:02:29| And those many things learned from looking at other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18149)|
| 5:02:33| Not only the city of Knoxville, Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18153)|
| 5:02:36| I actually went to 12 different organizations and looked at government fleet magazine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18156)|
| 5:02:42| and even did a survey, an online survey, of some of the best fleet managers in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18162)|
| 5:02:47| All pulling this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18167)|
| 5:02:49| The important specifics to consider in our debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18169)|
| 5:02:53| I draw your attention to the bottom of page seven where it specifically says that sheriff patrol vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18173)|
| 5:02:59| undercover detective vehicles, these are presumed to have a public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18179)|
| 5:03:04| These are not what this policy is about in any serious manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18184)|
| 5:03:08| They are exempted from all of the justification provisions regarding take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18188)|
| 5:03:13| So that's really a bogus issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18193)|
| 5:03:15| I hope it doesn't come up because it's just not an understanding of what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18195)|
| 5:03:18| The second thing I wanted to point out is at the bottom of page 13, a departmental policy section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18198)|
| 5:03:26| which says if a department has a stronger policy, then the stronger policy prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18206)|
| 5:03:32| So departments are free to come up with different policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18212)|
| 5:03:35| so long as they meet the minimum standard of the one we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18215)|
| 5:03:39| And finally, if there's an argument about powers and who has the right to do what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18219)|
| 5:03:45| this document on the top of page 14 has a separation clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18225)|
| 5:03:49| So in case anything we're doing is in any way thrown out by some court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18229)|
| 5:03:55| the entire thing doesn't go down, just the provision applying to that particular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18235)|
| 5:04:00| So I think when you add all this together and you look at all the steps that have taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18240)|
| 5:04:05| I think what you have before you is a good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18245)|
| 5:04:08| One that achieves the objective of having a clean, clear, consistent policy that achieves that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18248)|
| 5:04:14| That when we do that, we'll save the taxpayers some money and do all of us a great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18254)|
| 5:04:20| We've been through a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18260)|
| 5:04:21| I think we have a good document before us, and I certainly hope you will vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18261)|
| 5:04:28| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18268)|
| 5:04:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18270)|
| 5:04:32| Members of the Commission, as Commissioner Harmon said, we've been at this now for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18272)|
| 5:04:37| One of the things that Mr. Jarrett has said to us is that, to reiterate what Commissioner Harmon said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18277)|
| 5:04:42| this has never been formally adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18282)|
| 5:04:44| We have a policy, but it's never been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18284)|
| 5:04:46| Now, what are the ramifications of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18286)|
| 5:04:48| Mr. Jarrett has said that, obviously, we have a lot of people on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18288)|
| 5:04:51| We have a lot of people driving vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18291)|
| 5:04:53| If, indeed, there are accidents and so forth, which you do have from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18293)|
| 5:04:58| that perhaps this puts us at risk because we do not have a, quote, formal policy that's been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18298)|
| 5:05:04| What has transpired here, what Commissioner Harmon has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18304)|
| 5:05:07| is he's given our law director some of what we feel are improvements to the policy as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18307)|
| 5:05:13| You see in bold are those things that we feel are improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18313)|
| 5:05:17| The italicized is what is in the policy already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18317)|
| 5:05:21| And when you look at what has gone on here with regards to the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18321)|
| 5:05:26| you see such things as employees shall report tickets, moving violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18326)|
| 5:05:32| They cannot smoke while they're in a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18332)|
| 5:05:36| They must have valid driver's licenses, so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18336)|
| 5:05:39| What this does is it basically takes the policy that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18339)|
| 5:05:43| and I believe strengthens it, clarifies, and makes it a better policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18343)|
| 5:05:49| One of the things, too, that I think is important is, as we look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18349)|
| 5:05:53| it's already in the policy, but with regards to maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18353)|
| 5:05:55| When I was on the efficiency panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18355)|
| 5:05:57| one of the things we found was that there was a lack of accountability with regards to maintenance of vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18357)|
| 5:06:03| particularly some of the take-home vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18363)|
| 5:06:05| because we found that oil changes were not being done properly, tires were not being rotated properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18365)|
| 5:06:10| It was basically costing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18370)|
| 5:06:12| We actually had a couple of instances where engines were blown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18372)|
| 5:06:15| because they had not taken care of basic oil changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18375)|
| 5:06:19| This does not regulate the number of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18379)|
| 5:06:23| This does not say basically who can get a vehicle with regards to specific people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18383)|
| 5:06:28| This is a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18388)|
| 5:06:30| It's my understanding this policy will only be with regards to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18390)|
| 5:06:36| This will not be under the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18396)|
| 5:06:38| And so, again, in looking over it and having read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18398)|
| 5:06:42| I believe that it strengthens the policy that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18402)|
| 5:06:46| It gives us an opportunity to have a policy that has been formally adopted by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18406)|
| 5:06:52| So, again, I would encourage you to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18412)|
| 5:06:58| Commissioner, I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18418)|
| 5:07:00| I guess this question is to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18420)|
| 5:07:02| Just what department does this cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18422)|
| 5:07:05| And I think Mike Hammond said it did not cover the sheriff's or other departments, but just the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18425)|
| 5:07:12| Well, by and large, your largest vehicle fleet is the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18432)|
| 5:07:15| And my research indicates that almost none of the fee offices actually have take-home vehicles at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18435)|
| 5:07:23| And I believe that the sheriff will assert that due to the opt-out policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18443)|
| 5:07:29| or I should say at least the qualifier that if it's found to be unenforceable towards the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18449)|
| 5:07:34| So I think it's primarily, I don't want to speak for the intent of the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18454)|
| 5:07:38| because I'd have to defer to Commissioner Dr. Mark Harmon on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18458)|
| 5:07:43| That being said, ostensibly it's going to cover the entire mayor's office, which is the bulk of your vehicle fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18463)|
| 5:07:50| If there are fee offices out there that ultimately acquire take-home vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18470)|
| 5:07:57| I think we'd have a good argument that there would be no legal reason why it would not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18477)|
| 5:08:04| So I guess my question would be to, I guess, Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18484)|
| 5:08:08| Does this include the sheriff's cars, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18488)|
| 5:08:11| I point you again to the bottom of page seven where we talk about the uniformed officers, the undercover, the sheriff patrol vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18491)|
| 5:08:20| Those are specifically exempted from the provisions related to take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18500)|
| 5:08:25| So I think only in the most generic sense about, you know, not picking up a paycheck or some of that other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18505)|
| 5:08:33| would we actually see any implication for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18513)|
| 5:08:37| I think, by and large, we're looking at other vehicle uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18517)|
| 5:08:43| And I think the Deputy Law Director's statement on that is a correct reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18523)|
| 5:08:53| Would it be appropriate if I made a motion to make an amendment to exempt the sheriff's vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18533)|
| 5:09:01| Is that something I could do to make sure they are not in this regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18541)|
| 5:09:09| Sir, you know, there's a policy before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18549)|
| 5:09:11| There's nothing to preclude you from suggesting amendments, and that's not an illegal amendment by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18551)|
| 5:09:20| Ivan, just get the sheriff down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18560)|
| 5:09:22| Ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18562)|
| 5:09:23| A motion, Ivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18563)|
| 5:09:24| I guess the sheriff, if he would come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18564)|
| 5:09:29| I've heard him talk before, and I know where he stands, but I'd like to hear it from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18569)|
| 5:09:33| As it's been explained to me by the Assistant Law Director, if we had an opt-out clause, which I think we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18573)|
| 5:09:41| we would certainly opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18581)|
| 5:09:43| We do not wish to be a part of this, and we wish that any language in this be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18583)|
| 5:09:48| not to have us participate in any way that has anything to do with the sheriff's office in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18588)|
| 5:09:57| The appropriate amendment would be to opt out the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18597)|
| 5:10:03| Is that correct, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18603)|
| 5:10:08| If that's your desire, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18608)|
| 5:10:09| Again, here's the rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18609)|
| 5:10:12| The way this reads, it says that if policy is found unenforceable or void by any court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18612)|
| 5:10:21| or inapplicable to any department or any other entity, it essentially would not become part of this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18621)|
| 5:10:28| but the rest of the policy would be applicable to county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18628)|
| 5:10:32| We've discussed this with the sheriff back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18632)|
| 5:10:35| I haven't found any definitive law that reads the sheriff may be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18635)|
| 5:10:40| but nor have I found any definitive law that says he is not covered by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18640)|
| 5:10:45| He obviously does not want to be and obviously won't cooperate with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18645)|
| 5:10:49| But it's not like we can point to a Tennessee code section that says it applies or it doesn't apply to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18649)|
| 5:10:55| The AG hasn't opined on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18655)|
| 5:10:57| There's no case law on that that I've been able to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18657)|
| 5:10:59| So my point is if your desire is to be making a motion to say it doesn't apply to the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18659)|
| 5:11:04| that's clearly within your right to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18664)|
| 5:11:06| That's what I'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18666)|
| 5:11:12| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18672)|
| 5:11:13| I thought you wanted an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18673)|
| 5:11:15| Amendment taking the sheriff's office out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18675)|
| 5:11:18| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18678)|
| 5:11:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18679)|
| 5:11:20| Commissioner Horgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18680)|
| 5:11:23| It's not a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18683)|
| 5:11:24| I'd like it voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18684)|
| 5:11:30| So yours was an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18690)|
| 5:11:33| Remove the sheriff's department out of the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18693)|
| 5:11:37| That would be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18697)|
| 5:11:38| We need to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18698)|
| 5:11:42| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18702)|
| 5:11:45| I just want to talk about the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18705)|
| 5:11:47| I've got some more questions about the policy, but if we need to vote on the amendment first, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18707)|
| 5:11:52| I've got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18712)|
| 5:11:55| On the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18715)|
| 5:11:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18716)|
| 5:11:57| If I vote for the amendment, am I obligated to vote for the measure as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18717)|
| 5:12:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18723)|
| 5:12:06| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18726)|
| 5:12:07| We've got a new law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18727)|
| 5:12:11| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18731)|
| 5:12:13| Hey, I'm like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18733)|
| 5:12:15| I shop for the attorney that's going to tell me what I want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18735)|
| 5:12:21| So, Joe, am I obligated to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18741)|
| 5:12:24| Well, it's two separate and distinct motions before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18744)|
| 5:12:28| There's nothing to compel you to vote for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18748)|
| 5:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18750)|
| 5:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18751)|
| 5:12:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18752)|
| 5:12:34| Sheriff Jones, can I ask you a couple of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18754)|
| 5:12:38| Could you just speak to your disagreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18758)|
| 5:12:42| What are the sources that, in the policy specifically, what are the biggest rubs for you all in terms of the performance of your duty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18762)|
| 5:12:51| You obviously think that this is an infringement on your authority to run the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18771)|
| 5:12:57| So could you just talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18777)|
| 5:13:00| And I think that each one of you all got a copy of our general orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18780)|
| 5:13:04| which show a very clear and concise way that we do business with take-home vehicles and how we use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18784)|
| 5:13:10| Secondly, there is the main rub in it says that our officers can't use the vehicle off-duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18790)|
| 5:13:17| which some of our guys have to work two and three extra jobs to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18797)|
| 5:13:22| If you take that vehicle away from them, which the state of Tennessee lets the highway patrol use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18802)|
| 5:13:26| the Knoxville Police Department lets their officers use their vehicle off-duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18806)|
| 5:13:30| We reimburse Knox County for our officers who use those vehicles off-duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18810)|
| 5:13:35| So you're severely limiting our employees who drive these vehicles to work side jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18815)|
| 5:13:41| which would impair us to compete with other agencies who let their people do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18821)|
| 5:13:47| I think that's the main rub I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18827)|
| 5:13:51| And I already think that we have a clear and concise policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18831)|
| 5:13:54| Each and every one of you all have seen it, and I've heard none, no negative feedback whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18834)|
| 5:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18840)|
| 5:14:01| That seems reasonable to me, Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18841)|
| 5:14:03| Dr. Harmon, could you respond to that in terms of best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18843)|
| 5:14:09| and other places that have similar concerns in law enforcement and take-home vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18849)|
| 5:14:16| Well, once again, I would point to the exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18856)|
| 5:14:19| that under that exemption the thing that the sheriff talked about would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18859)|
| 5:14:23| So I'm not worried about it because that exemption there near the bottom of page seven is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18863)|
| 5:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18871)|
| 5:14:32| So, Sheriff, you're exempted in that instance that you're describing to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18872)|
| 5:14:38| The more familiar type of take-home car that tends to get negative reactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18878)|
| 5:14:51| are people that are not law enforcement people under your jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18891)|
| 5:14:56| And so what about those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18896)|
| 5:14:59| What about the people that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18899)|
| 5:15:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18901)|
| 5:15:02| And as I have tried to explain before, these positions are covered by the merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18902)|
| 5:15:09| This vehicle that they drive, again, I will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18909)|
| 5:15:13| I have not granted any vehicles to anyone that didn't have them before I became sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18913)|
| 5:15:19| These vehicles are considered compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18919)|
| 5:15:22| Under merit board policies, I cannot remove compensation from an employee without cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18922)|
| 5:15:29| unless we compensate them for X amount of dollars of what we decide this vehicle is worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18929)|
| 5:15:35| Now, if we're ready to do that, I'm sure Commissioner Hammond has stated $5,000 to $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18935)|
| 5:15:41| Now, I'm sure that I'll have employees standing in line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18941)|
| 5:15:44| if you want to give them $5,000 to $8,000 extra a year and take their vehicle away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18944)|
| 5:15:47| I promise you we can cut some cars down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18947)|
| 5:15:49| So if you're ready to do that, we'll line them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18949)|
| 5:15:52| But unless we can compensate them for the vehicles they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18952)|
| 5:15:55| we can't unjustly deny them compensation under our merit board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18955)|
| 5:16:02| Take it one more degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18962)|
| 5:16:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18965)|
| 5:16:10| Commissioners, if I could respond to one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18970)|
| 5:16:13| He'd asked a question earlier about-he said that it did not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18973)|
| 5:16:16| If you read page 10 of your policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18976)|
| 5:16:18| he talks about how law enforcement officers that are driving marked cars and unmarked detectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18978)|
| 5:16:23| this doesn't apply to them, which means they get their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18983)|
| 5:16:26| Flip over to page 10, an acceptable use of a take-home car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18986)|
| 5:16:30| What the first part of the policy says is they have an acceptable use for a take-home car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18990)|
| 5:16:34| which means they get the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18994)|
| 5:16:36| Look at page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18996)|
| 5:16:37| Look at E in page 10 under acceptable uses of take-home cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=18997)|
| 5:16:41| Assigned and take-home vehicles shall not be used for a part-time job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19001)|
| 5:16:46| or driven from a part-time job not associated with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19006)|
| 5:16:49| So for the commissioner, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19009)|
| 5:16:51| to say that it doesn't apply to the marked units and the detective units is simply not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19011)|
| 5:16:55| in accordance with the policy you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19015)|
| 5:16:58| What the marked business has to do with is their ability to get the car assigned to them in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19018)|
| 5:17:03| What this does is say that after they get it assigned to them, they can't use it on a part-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19023)|
| 5:17:08| And as the sheriff has indicated, we have a lot of our people that make a lot of money doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19028)|
| 5:17:12| We are at an incredible competitive disadvantage to try to get people from the commissioners from KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19032)|
| 5:17:19| KPD authorizes them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19039)|
| 5:17:20| THP authorizes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19040)|
| 5:17:22| Every law enforcement agency around authorizes their officers to use them on take-home cars on a private basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19042)|
| 5:17:29| reimburse the county for the expenses that the car is used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19049)|
| 5:17:32| So for him to say it doesn't apply is just simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19052)|
| 5:17:35| Well, Mr. Rule, before you start asserting it's not a truism or he's making a false statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19055)|
| 5:17:40| recall when we've had these conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19060)|
| 5:17:42| this specific issue about officers using their take-home cars for basically private security work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19062)|
| 5:17:50| has never really been raised with this board before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19070)|
| 5:17:52| So this is not like this has been a recurring issue that you've raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19072)|
| 5:17:55| No, but the commissioner just said that it didn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19075)|
| 5:17:58| The sheriff came up here and said that the take-home car issue was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19078)|
| 5:18:01| Commissioner Harmon said it didn't matter because the marked units were allowed to be taken home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19081)|
| 5:18:05| I'm pointing out to you that you have two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19085)|
| 5:18:07| You have a take-home car issue and then you have an acceptable use of those take-home car issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19087)|
| 5:18:12| And under this policy, it's not an acceptable use to use a part-time car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19092)|
| 5:18:16| excuse me, to use a car on your part-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19096)|
| 5:18:19| That's your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19099)|
| 5:18:20| I didn't write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19100)|
| 5:18:22| Mike, I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19102)|
| 5:18:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19103)|
| 5:18:24| It's Mike Rubel of 400 Main Avenue, Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19104)|
| 5:18:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19108)|
| 5:18:29| Mark Harmon, could you make that an exception within your policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19109)|
| 5:18:32| First, I would be happy to make that exception and make that absolutely clear within the pending proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19112)|
| 5:18:36| I'd be happy to amend either on page 10 or page 7 to say that those marked vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19116)|
| 5:18:42| and vehicles may be used for part-time jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19122)|
| 5:18:46| By law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19126)|
| 5:18:48| By law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19128)|
| 5:18:50| Further, I would point out that there's two IRS pamphlets, 15B and 2B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19130)|
| 5:18:55| which also speak to the question about whether under IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19135)|
| 5:19:01| it's considered a cut in pay when a take-home vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19141)|
| 5:19:04| and they both disagree with the conclusion reached by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19144)|
| 5:19:09| I second agree with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19149)|
| 5:19:14| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19154)|
| 5:19:17| I think basically to cut to the chase, you know, the sheriff doesn't want to be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19157)|
| 5:19:23| And he's going to fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19163)|
| 5:19:26| And so I would just as soon go ahead and take the sheriff's department out and let's get a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19166)|
| 5:19:30| This is a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19170)|
| 5:19:32| This is something that we can look at and, you know, maybe down the road we can look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19172)|
| 5:19:35| and do some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19175)|
| 5:19:37| But that's not a fight that I want to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19177)|
| 5:19:40| I would just as soon go ahead and let the sheriff's department opt out, let them do their own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19180)|
| 5:19:44| Let's start with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19184)|
| 5:19:46| And, you know, a year from now we may look at it and we want to make some revisions or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19186)|
| 5:19:49| So I don't know if I need to accept his amendment or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19189)|
| 5:19:54| I'm in favor of going on ahead with the amendment to let the sheriff opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19194)|
| 5:19:58| Let's go ahead and vote on the amendment that's in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19198)|
| 5:20:01| and then we'll decide if we need to make exceptions depending on if that passes or doesn't pass about opting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19201)|
| 5:20:06| Instead of making this a part of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19206)|
| 5:20:10| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19210)|
| 5:20:11| That's what I was thinking that you would accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19211)|
| 5:20:13| That would be fine to proceed along the way that Commissioner Lutold and Hammond have just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19213)|
| 5:20:16| Just make it a part of a separate amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19216)|
| 5:20:18| Mr. Chairman, before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19218)|
| 5:20:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19219)|
| 5:20:20| I need to recuse myself because my wife does work at the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19220)|
| 5:20:25| and I want Commissioner Briggs to take due note I didn't do any discussion this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19225)|
| 5:20:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19231)|
| 5:20:33| Just one quick comment before we do vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19233)|
| 5:20:35| You know, when we look at the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19235)|
| 5:20:38| it's a totally different animal than the other departments that we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19238)|
| 5:20:45| Their situations can change, and I'm sure Brad can attest to this with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19245)|
| 5:20:50| Their situations can change momentarily, hourly, weekly, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19250)|
| 5:20:55| The needs change momentarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19255)|
| 5:20:58| I feel safer, and I know that our constituents across the county feel safer seeing those county cars out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19258)|
| 5:21:06| and seeing an officer in uniform because they feel like that, you know, there's somebody I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19266)|
| 5:21:11| You know, they're there if I need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19271)|
| 5:21:13| So I think it would be an injustice to try to pin down the sheriff's department to a finite set of rules that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19273)|
| 5:21:22| this car can't go but seven miles on Sunday and 14 each day during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19282)|
| 5:21:27| I mean, that's kind of silly in a sense, but that's really what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19287)|
| 5:21:33| I think they need to have the latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19293)|
| 5:21:35| We elect a person in that job who puts people in there who are out here every day defending our freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19295)|
| 5:21:43| and protecting us as best they can, and we need to give them the latitude they need to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19303)|
| 5:21:51| So I would vote for the opting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19311)|
| 5:21:54| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19314)|
| 5:21:57| Are we speaking on the amendment or on the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19317)|
| 5:21:59| Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19319)|
| 5:22:04| Let's vote on the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19324)|
| 5:22:09| Excluding the sheriff's office is the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19329)|
| 5:22:13| Yes, your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19333)|
| 5:22:14| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19334)|
| 5:22:17| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19337)|
| 5:22:18| He accepted, but you didn't accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19338)|
| 5:22:20| No, he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19340)|
| 5:22:21| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19341)|
| 5:22:24| That Ivan Harmon proposed, which is to exclude the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19344)|
| 5:22:29| Mike Brown seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19349)|
| 5:22:30| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19350)|
| 5:22:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19352)|
| 5:22:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19354)|
| 5:22:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19355)|
| 5:22:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19356)|
| 5:22:38| Motion passes 17-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19358)|
| 5:22:41| Now we're voting on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19361)|
| 5:22:43| I recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19363)|
| 5:22:45| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19365)|
| 5:22:47| Opposed, 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19367)|
| 5:22:50| 16 yes, 1 no, and 1 recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19370)|
| 5:22:54| Now we're back on the original motion with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19374)|
| 5:22:59| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19379)|
| 5:23:02| On page 8 of the policy, the issue I have with it is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19382)|
| 5:23:08| we're a part-time legislative body trying to run the day-to-day functions of a full-time government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19388)|
| 5:23:15| Unacceptable justifications for a 24-hour assignment, which is take-home car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19395)|
| 5:23:20| Employee's job requires attendance at meetings or other functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19400)|
| 5:23:23| Where are we going to save money if we're paying mileage every time somebody drives the county business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19403)|
| 5:23:31| My question is, how are we saving money if we're paying mileage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19411)|
| 5:23:36| We're not selling any cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19416)|
| 5:23:38| We're not cutting down on the fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19418)|
| 5:23:42| Where's the money savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19422)|
| 5:23:45| Yes, sir, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19425)|
| 5:23:47| That's a question to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19427)|
| 5:23:48| I'll answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19428)|
| 5:23:49| If there are fewer justified reasons to have a car, then there likely will be fewer cars at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19429)|
| 5:23:55| and thus there will be a savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19435)|
| 5:23:57| As far as reimbursement goes, I mean, there are some sort of break-even points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19437)|
| 5:24:03| where it makes more sense to have a vehicle as opposed to reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19443)|
| 5:24:07| And most of the research I have done suggests that that's somewhere between 500 and 1,000 miles a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19447)|
| 5:24:13| So that's why we have a justification clause within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19453)|
| 5:24:20| I just feel that, you know, if you want to run the mayor's office, run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19460)|
| 5:24:28| Mr. Anderson, excuse me for interrupting, but we are a policy-making body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19468)|
| 5:24:32| and we also are the purse strings of the county, and that's why I think it's our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19472)|
| 5:24:37| I think both of them have a policy in effect that's from both of their offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19477)|
| 5:24:42| The sheriff's office has a general order, and we're not voting on it anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19482)|
| 5:24:45| but there was a policy given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19485)|
| 5:24:47| What was the shortness of that policy to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19487)|
| 5:24:52| You mean shortness in terms of deficiency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19492)|
| 5:24:54| Yeah, where is it deficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19494)|
| 5:24:56| Well, what I did is I compared it to other policies, and I found certain things missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19496)|
| 5:25:02| And so you can clearly tell the italic print here is the original policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19502)|
| 5:25:09| and the non-italic traditional font is where the additions have come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19509)|
| 5:25:14| And that's where I thought the additions were necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19514)|
| 5:25:16| And there's a whole bunch of them in there, some of them Commissioner Hammond has already relayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19516)|
| 5:25:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19527)|
| 5:25:30| Well, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19530)|
| 5:25:31| I guess I'm probably stepping into a pond that I shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19531)|
| 5:25:39| But I guess as a question, don't step in again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19539)|
| 5:25:44| Step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19544)|
| 5:25:45| Didn't stop you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19545)|
| 5:25:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19546)|
| 5:25:48| In terms of how does this marry to the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19548)|
| 5:25:54| And I guess I'm just trying to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19554)|
| 5:25:56| I'm digging in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19556)|
| 5:25:58| If you have a county vehicle, I'm not talking sheriff now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19558)|
| 5:26:02| We're just talking county mayor's office vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19562)|
| 5:26:06| How do we deal with parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19566)|
| 5:26:08| Does a parking pass come with a county vehicle is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19568)|
| 5:26:13| Does anyone know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19573)|
| 5:26:14| And I don't even know who to direct it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19574)|
| 5:26:16| Well, as the author of the motion, I can tell you that this particular motion is silent on the question of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19576)|
| 5:26:22| If we wish to address parking, we should address it separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19582)|
| 5:26:26| If I might add, Mr. Chairman, the last report that I saw from our county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19586)|
| 5:26:31| only eight people who had a take-home vehicle paid parking, and those were in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19591)|
| 5:26:36| And to answer your question specifically, Commissioner, we will be addressing parking possibly next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19596)|
| 5:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19602)|
| 5:26:44| Commissioner Holliman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19604)|
| 5:26:47| I guess my next question is how does this affect the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19607)|
| 5:26:49| Do they have drive-home cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19609)|
| 5:26:51| Does this affect them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19611)|
| 5:26:52| We give them their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19612)|
| 5:26:56| He told us last time they got less than ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19616)|
| 5:27:00| It don't matter if we got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19620)|
| 5:27:01| It's a drive-home car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19621)|
| 5:27:02| I mean, how does it affect them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19622)|
| 5:27:04| None of them would be able to drive them home under this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19624)|
| 5:27:08| Based on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19628)|
| 5:27:09| I'm wondering what's the rationale for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19629)|
| 5:27:11| Because I think some people traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19631)|
| 5:27:14| Most of them are in security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19634)|
| 5:27:16| And, you know, some of their people get travel pay because they chose that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19636)|
| 5:27:21| But, you know, their security guys, during the summer, they don't drive 500 miles in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19641)|
| 5:27:25| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19645)|
| 5:27:26| I mean, the schools are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19646)|
| 5:27:27| They've got summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19647)|
| 5:27:28| They've got some other investigations to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19648)|
| 5:27:31| But they're on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19651)|
| 5:27:32| But, you know, it was unacceptable up here on page seven that you'd be on call 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19652)|
| 5:27:38| And some of your job was in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=19658)|
