| 0:01:56| Moving on, we'll have our devotional by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Thank you, Madam Chair. It is my distinct pleasure to welcome to our commission meeting today Deacon Walt Otey from the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus to welcome us and bring our devotional to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=120)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you for being with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| Let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Good and gracious God, we are thankful on behalf of all that are gathered here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| We thank you for the many and abundant blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| We thank you for the gift of life itself and for the measure of health we need to fulfill our callings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| We thank you also for the ability to be involved in useful work and for the honor of bearing appropriate responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=157)|
| 0:02:45| In sacred scriptures, you have said that citizens ought to obey the governing authorities since you have established those very authorities to promote peace, order, and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=165)|
| 0:02:56| Therefore, I pray for our mayor, for the various levels of county officials, and in particular for this assembled commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=176)|
| 0:03:05| I ask that you graciously grant them wisdom to govern amid the conflicting interests and issues of our time, a sense of the welfare and true needs of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=185)|
| 0:03:15| a keen thirst for justice, confidence in what is good and fitting, the ability to work together in harmony even when there is honest disagreement, and personal peace in their lives and joy in their tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=195)|
| 0:03:31| I pray for the agenda set before them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Please give an assurance of what would please you and what would benefit those who live and work around our beloved Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| We ask all this through Jesus' name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| Amen. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| Moving on to the pledge, and I see our Girl Scout troop could not make it today, but I'm turning that matter over to Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=227)|
| 0:04:01| Oh. Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| Clearly, our Girl Scouts weren't here today because they were in school, so I will allow our Senior Commissioner for District 2 to lead us in the pledge today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=245)|
| 0:04:16| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=256)|
| 0:04:40| Thank you. Moving on to amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| These items will be a little bit of change for our sitting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| We will be adding item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=291)|

| 0:05:24| Again, non-consent, 29, 30, 34, through 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=324)|
| 0:05:34| Are there any further amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=334)|
| 0:05:44| I apologize. Withdrawal is number 31. I believe I said 3. We are withdrawing item 31. My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=344)|
| 0:05:56| All right. Further amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Madam Chair, thank you. I need to postpone number 44 for 30 days, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| 30 deferred until you want 44 deferred until the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=375)|
| 0:06:24| All right. 44, item 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| All right. Seeing no other changes or lights, Commissioner Buehler, did you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| Did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| No, I was going to make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| Thank you. Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Motion to set the agenda as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| Thank you. Motion by Buehler, second by Durant. Any discussion? All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Opposed? Motion carries. I am looking for a motion to approve the educational and government consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Motion by Jay, second by Frazier. Any discussion? All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Opposed? Motion carries. Thank you. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| Item number 28, presentation of the quarterly fire and technical rescue committee report by Director Brent Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| Welcome, Mr. Seymour. If you would give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=450)|
| 0:07:38| I'm on. Thank you. Brent Seymour, 1630 Huron Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| Again, thank you for the opportunity to give the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| We really appreciate the support that you guys give us in the endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| So what you see is our fire and technical rescue report for the last quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| You'll notice that, again, like most quarters, our call volume is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| We're not getting any slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| With a rapidly expanding community and population, we continue to see elevated levels of service all across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| One of the most things I'm excited about for the last quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| because I know how hard both of these, or one of these, are to do, much less two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| And that's open a firehouse and get a new fire truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| And Carnes managed to do both last quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| That's great. With a rapidly growing community out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| they're able to elevate their level of service provision out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| and provide an even better level of service and quicker response to the citizens of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| I think is a great testament to their leadership and their membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| because either one of those by itself is very difficult to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| And they were able to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| And that's really neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| I geek out a little bit on new trucks and new firehouses because they're so uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Obviously, you see that happen, but to be able to do that is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| And they graduated a recruit academy, added seven members to their force out there, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| The more people we can get into the business, we like that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| It's hard to recruit for public service type work now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| so seven new members in the Carnes community is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| You'll see there with Knox County Rescue over the holidays and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| they did a whole lot of community service stuff as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| delivering food baskets, Santa Claus for some kids in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| able to provide them with some gifts and some other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| And able to make Christmas special for several members in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| And again, one of the big topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| although we had a burn ban in place for several weeks last quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| we still had over 200 separate incidents of grass and brush fires in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| It's pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| I know folks here burn ban and you're like, I'm not going to set my leaves on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| I'm not going to set my brush on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| But they don't think about the smaller things like the fire pits getting hot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| with the leaves and the brush around their fire pit area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| We had a couple of those that actually flamed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| and extended into a couple of structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| So they weren't out burning stuff on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| They were actually a fire pit type fire or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| or the wind blew the grill over, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| So 200 separate incidents of brush and grass fires last quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| A couple of those as one of the pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| that's the picture in what I call Concord Marina area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| I know that's been renamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| That could have been, although it looks pretty good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| that could have been much worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| thanks to the dedication of that wildland team that Knox County was able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| or Metro was able to form for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| That deployable asset, they really mitigated that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| and made it much less than what it could have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| And there was another one or two that they really had an impact on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| That wildland team activated and got out there and stopped that progression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| and was able to limit the damage to what we know happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| other than maybe a couple of structures involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| or something like that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| So kudos to those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| That's a great asset and a great resource for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| and we're proud to have those folks in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| And then on the end there, you'll see more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| They've updated a couple of their rehab trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| So that's a traffic and rehab trailer that they were able to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| They've outfitted that with, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| for major highway incidents and rehab for their firefighters on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| The trailer that was doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| they're able to transition that trailer into some technical rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| transportation capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| because, again, like all of our departments in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| we're expanding services and we're increasing what we're able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| and the level of service we're able to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| So we're real happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| That's a great addition to that area in south Knoxville down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| And Chief Linson Bigler and his crews went a long way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| into trying to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| And that's pretty much it, pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| I know you guys got a full agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Am I having questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Really, it's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| I just wanted to commend our fire and rescue agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| that really stepped up during the storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| You know, we saw just a great approach to responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| and all of our agencies coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| And it was really wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| I heard from several of them, checked in with many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| And the way that they were coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| and utilizing each other's resources, vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| to keep people like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| we can't get huge fire trucks into some of these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| that have four inches of ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| And so they were utilizing other agencies' vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| And that was just great to see, great to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| And so I just wanted to commend our fire and rescue services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| for really stepping up and helping where they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| And, you know, it's hard to quantify something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| And I have no doubt that we kept some apparatus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| from being damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Obviously, you're more than likely well aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| of the fire truck that turned over on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Fortunately, nobody was hurt there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| But I have no doubt that those four-wheel drive vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| ran almost 1,300 calls in about that eight-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| to ten-day period right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| And what a lot of people don't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| is the same crews working the four-wheel drive units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| that are working the fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| And a lot of folks don't think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| They'll work the four-wheel drive units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| they'll sleep for hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| then they'll go back on shift at the firehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| So essentially, those same crews worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| those eight or ten days with rest periods nonstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| And you have to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| because you don't have the staff to be able to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| Because we put 10 or 12 four-wheel drives on duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| with at least two, if not three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| and to gather those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| aside from the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| that are working the engines and the medic units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| is pretty difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| So hopefully you guys' next report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| or in the coming weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| you'll have some data on everything that went on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| And if you don't, I'd be happy to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| what I have with you next time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| But thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| We really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Thank you, and please extend thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| to all of the departments and EMS for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| We certainly appreciate the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Just as a side note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| I've had a couple of requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| for a report from Director Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| about what we've just come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| I made the decision to let him catch his breath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| and kind of pull things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| So next month, next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| next month we'll be hearing from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| a little bit about the response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| and some of the statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| about things that were used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| and their man hours and that type of thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| So I think we'll all look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| I earlier asked for elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| and I see Mayor Jacobs, you've joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| For public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| we have no one on agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| The public forum for non-agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=945)|

| 0:15:57| Thank you, and I'll add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| that we are approving the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=959)|

| 0:22:08| And my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| is one elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| going to be able to silence another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| elected official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| would you like to address the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| in the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Actually, this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| this came about with seeing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| problems in some of the boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| and committees and it was negatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| impacting the ability to have a quorum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| and to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| For instance, we had one committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| that was unable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| vote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| pass minutes from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| meeting that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| four months prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| And so it really started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| there and then also talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| several of the chairs of some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| They were very much in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| having just a standard policy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| they could use as a guideline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| because right now several of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| boards and committees don't have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| of structure or bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| And so we're really trying to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| And it's just a good standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| of practice to have an attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Having been an HR director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| that's something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| you know, I personally feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| it's just a good best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Do I think that it would silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| another elected official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| It is my opinion that it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| not. I'll defer to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Moyers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| But then also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| what was your third point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| you asked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Oh, the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| It would be the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Yeah, it would be the chair of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| committee or board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| No, the chair of the committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| or the boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Mr. Moyers, did you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| respond to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| silencing of another elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| I'm not really sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| what's meant by that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Can you elaborate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Well, my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| the way that reads, you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| that the chair could kick somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Are you talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| No, this is not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| We we serve on several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| county affiliated boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| if we serve on that board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| committee and they have they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| to adopt this attendance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| then we fall within those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| But there are several that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| we don't serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| BZA planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| But this we're not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| attendance of commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| If you're referring to as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| elected official, the people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| to decide that if they're unhappy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| with a commissioner's attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| the people decide that this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| doesn't decide that, nor does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| our commission chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| We're talking about affiliate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| county affiliated boards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I'm in full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| support of this attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| And the main reason was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| is when I first got on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| we members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| of the audit committee where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| there's only three commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| and two CPAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| they were running into an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| where they would have meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| and they couldn't get a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| And so that's how I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| got on the audit committee was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| because the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| that was supposed to be serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| in that committee was a no show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| And so they resigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| and I was able to get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| But, you know, otherwise they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| holding, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| basically six meetings a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| with they can't vote because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| they don't have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| So I think this is an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1557)|

| 0:32:33| Moving on now to public forum on open topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| We have three speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| The first one is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Is Kevin here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| We'll call for him again at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| Barry Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| Mr. Marshall, if you give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| I'll give you five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you, Chair Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| My name is Barry Marshall, 5518 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| One is kind of an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Eight months ago we had a pro-cycling event here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| Since our county budget, I guess somewhere between 60-65% of the county budget goes toward schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| I kind of wanted to give an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| I'm a cycling fan, so I came and watched both events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| It was a good day, other than the rain, for the men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| But the main reason I was here that day was for the protest against Alston Killip's transgender female cycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2015)|
| 0:33:45| And there was a lot of us there for that protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And at that time, she could be in the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| A month later, after the work that we did, Riley Gaines did, our county mayor was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| the ruling became down that you had to go through puberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| If you had gone through puberty, you could not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| So I just wanted to say that I think it's very important to keep this effort up because where this is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2048)|
| 0:34:18| it's not from red states and blue states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| It was unfortunate we had a politician who wants to chair this commission there speaking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| when we had a registered elite athlete, a registered Democrat from California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| flew in on her own dime to speak with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| But the view should be more like our mayor that day was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| It's a simple fairness issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I appreciate him commenting about his two daughters and being allowed to have fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| I have a daughter, four granddaughters, three foster girls, and one of them just had a baby girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| So I think it's important for us to know where that pressure comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| It's not from red states and blue states, but it's from professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| It's from the prize money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Then that comes to the NCAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Then that comes down into our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| So I just want you to keep up the pressure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| With my remaining three minutes, I have a comment about last week's communications from the county spokesperson regarding the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2112)|
| 0:35:22| Apparently, there was some issues back and forth regarding the mayor's whereabouts and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| I really, in analyzing it, and a lot of my friends feel there were no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| I mean, everybody has time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| I mean, as long as the time is there to take and no county expenses were used, which I'm sure they weren't, that's up to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| But I would say that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| The problem I have is Mike Dinella making the statement that electing Donald Trump is county work, and that was the mayor's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2148)|
| 0:35:58| That is not county work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| We all know what county work is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| Parks and rec, public works, on and on, security, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| It wasn't county work in 1988 when I was 18 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| Dwight Kessel was the executive, and I couldn't pull the lever for Baker then because I was an 18, but I eventually pulled it for Reagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2174)|
| 0:36:23| But it wouldn't have been appropriate for a county spokesperson to say who I should vote for or who the mayor's opinion is to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| It wouldn't have been appropriate in 1994 when my football coach, Tommy Chumpert, is central if he would have said, well, you need to be for Bob Dole instead of Alexander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2190)|
| 0:36:41| There's two U.S. districts in the nation, Colorado 3 and Georgia 14, that are turning into freak shows because of this type of thing about government leading people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2201)|
| 0:36:57| Knox County is an extremely professional county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| So is the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| We have great workers in both the city and the county, and I don't want us to go down a road of having county officials make statements that have anything to do with what any human being who's allowed to vote, who they should vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2224)|
| 0:37:20| It's probably illegal, the statement that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| It's highly inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I'm not for our current naked emperor, and I don't want another naked emperor to replace that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2247)|
| 0:37:37| I'm going with an intelligent woman, but, again, that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| If I was on this board, it would be highly inappropriate for me to state in my role what any of you or any of the 400,000 people in our county should do on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2262)|
| 0:37:54| And so, again, I just hope that we can get a little more professional as far as the communication that's put out by the spokesman on issues like that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2274)|
| 0:38:07| Chair Hill, I thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Our next person signed up is Vivian Lee, or Vivian Scheib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Sorry, Vivian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Vivian, were you just addressing one item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| If you give us your name and address and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Vivian Scheib, 3615 MLK, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| I'm coming before you today to speak to you about the last ten days and what occurred during those last ten days when we had the warming centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2317)|
| 0:38:46| The first thing I want to do is I want to thank Lawrence and Jay publicly because what I saw when I saw him go with the mobile meals was so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2326)|
| 0:39:00| I know everybody can do what they can do from where they were at, but when you know people who cannot get food, when you are snowed in and your meals come every day and those trucks came out there from far and wide to get to the people they could get to, lives were saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2340)|
| 0:39:17| So I know you're a humble person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| You won't accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| But understand that I see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| And God says you will call out those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| You don't have to speak for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| The Lord shall speak for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| And what was happening this past week was very spiritual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| I'm just going to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| We were walking in Matthew 25, 3540 moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| We were walking in Proverbs 1917 moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| God was separating the wheat from the chaff last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| There was a lot of tests last week and a lot of people failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Your public, your people in the city and the county did not fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| They came out of the woodwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| When I tell you lives were saved, if you were in the warming centers when we were sending out the food and trying to get the clothes to them and people were saying, yay, we got underwear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| You know, that's a major thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| When you see a three-month-old baby being held by an elder man so the mother can eat, when you were seeing, what you saw was human.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| It wasn't party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| It wasn't political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| It was the humanness of us coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Lives were saved last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| And I had to come and I had to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I've already been to city council and I was coming to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I wasn't here Monday, but God got in my midst and said, you need to call the county because I'm thinking you're next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| And he said, no, no, they're today at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| And here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| So I want you all to understand one thing that we saw, it's not just the addicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| There were new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| There were new homeless out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| People are in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| So where I'm here today is don't let this be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| Right now, give up your buildings, those empty buildings, those nuisances buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Give them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Put money into the hands of the ones that are doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| This is not over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| We have got to take care of the least of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| We are a great city and we're a great county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| The city sits in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| So you are all the shepherds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| So I'm just coming before you to say thank you to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you to the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you to everybody that did what you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| But this cannot be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| And it will not be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| The Lord sees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| You all put your hand on the Bible and took oaths to take care of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Last week was a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| What you can do in your spirit is say, did I pass it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you, Vivian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Did Kevin Murphy come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I don't believe I've seen him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| That ends our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Is there any other business that this commission would like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| Earlier, I guess yesterday, we got a notice from the executive director of the Tennessee County Commissioners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2506)|
| 0:41:54| And if you didn't get the email, please let me know and I'll forward that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| But this is kind of one of those called action times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| And apparently because nothing is in black and white in Nashville as far as what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2521)|
| 0:42:10| the intent is to restrict counties' ability to raise funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| In other words, they want to put a cap on the amount of property tax that you can collect, a cap of 2 percent per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| Well, a couple of reasons I'm against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| Logically, what if you're a very rural county and you have some event that drastically changes your dynamics and you need to be able to raise money quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2547)|
| 0:42:38| Most of those counties only can do that through property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Well, if there's a cap, all of a sudden now you're not going to have a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| And there could be some serious consequences to your bond rating for your county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Now, Knox County, as much as we generate in property tax, a 2 percent cap possibly could work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2571)|
| 0:43:01| But it's not fair for the state to come in and mandate to how the counties can derive their revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2581)|
| 0:43:10| You know, the state can raise their revenue anytime they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| We don't have any voice to say, no, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| So if you know your local representative personally over the weekend, it'd be great to reach out and say, hey, this is just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2598)|
| 0:43:30| It's not right at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| And they have no business trying to say how a county can generate revenue from their property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2612)|
| 0:43:41| So thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| I would just like to add I appreciate the cooperation of the Tire Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| It's been challenging on a lot of levels these last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| We've had to push around a lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| And I appreciate very much the way everyone has gotten on board and allowed us to move forward on short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| So seeing no other lights, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240126?start=2646)|
