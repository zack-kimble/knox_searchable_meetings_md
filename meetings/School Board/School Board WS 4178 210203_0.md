| 0:02:27| Okay, and I'd like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for his report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| A few updates this evening for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| I want to begin by acknowledging that this winter weather has presented some challenges this week, as many of you know and have experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| We know that this may be difficult for some of our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| I just want to emphasize, though, that the safety of our students, families, and employees is our top priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| and that whenever possible, we try to make early decisions about weather delays or moving to virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| However, there are times when it's difficult to anticipate what road conditions will be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| and as a result, we at times make decisions early in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| With that in mind, I would like to encourage our families to have an alternative plan in place for those days when a delay or a move to virtual learning happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| especially on short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| So we probably, over the next, I don't know, eight to ten weeks maybe, will be experiencing winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| So hopefully it will be a short one and we can get on with spring and not have these kinds of challenges during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| And as I said, I understand that this is challenging for families, but I do appreciate the community's support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| as we try to keep everyone safe while also continuing to provide in-person instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| And last week, we shared some very exciting news from the City of Knoxville and the Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| In the coming days, families of KCS students in grades 6 through 12 will receive a Youth Freedom Pass in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| This pass will allow their secondary student to ride CAT buses at no charge through the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| Knox County Schools will continue to provide school transportation on our yellow buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| but the Freedom Pass will help students gain access to jobs, visit libraries and museums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| and take part in social activities on evenings and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| So we're very appreciative for that, and I want to thank Knoxville Mayor India Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| and CAT Director of Transit Isaac Thorne for their leadership on this program and their support of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| I also want to thank our KCS students who participated in the marketing effort for the Freedom Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| Asia Chesney of Austin East and Emily Robinson of Bearden High starred in the promotional video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| and Ayanna Jones and Jude Pollard of Fulton High created the artwork for a poster campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| So thank you very much to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| February is Black History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| I also want to thank our educators for their work to highlight the contributions, achievements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| and history of African Americans in our curriculum throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| and to help ensure that the diversity of our district is reflected in our teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Madam Chair, members of the board, that concludes my report for this evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas. Any questions for the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Okay. All right, and now I would like to call on Ms. Christy Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| She has the vision spotlight for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| Right, and I have a video I would like to share that was made by one of our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| and a local realtor in South Knoxville, and I think you guys have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| and then I can just say something afterwards about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| So, Jeff, if you could start just by telling us kind of what your education is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| your background, and then what you do here at South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| Sure. I'm actually a, because I went to school for seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| I'm an engineer, a structural engineer, and I did that for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| I decided I wanted to sit behind a desk for the rest of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| and I wanted to actually teach and coach football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| and so somebody said, can you teach drafting at South Doyle High School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| And I said, well, I don't know where South Doyle is, and I've never had drafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| And so they said, well, we're going to let you try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| So they let me try, and that was 18 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| And so I've been in the same building, same room, and so I'm not coaching football anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| but I'm a full-time dad now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| That's awesome. That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Okay, so what is your official title here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| I know you're a teacher, but tell me a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| I teach architectural engineering drafting, or engineering design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| Right now they try to model it more towards architectural engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| and then teaching kids how to design and build, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| Great. That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| So correct me if I'm wrong, but a few years ago there was a big push for CTE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| What is CTE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| CTE is Career and Technical Education, and we've actually had the governor come through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| When he came to Knoxville, he actually came to South Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| South Doyle High School has one of the best-kept secrets of career and technical education classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| We have anywhere from culinary arts to cosmetology to health science to building trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| welding, architectural engineering design, and just all kinds of different things we can teach kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| If you want to go to college, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| If you don't want to go to college and want to get out and be a blue-collar worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| you're going to have the skills and opportunities to do that from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| So the county, through this push for CTE, funded this machine for South Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| So if you can tell me a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| You know, the county does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Our CTE department in Knox County is just great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| They provide so many things for these kids to learn and work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| One of the things they did was buy this machine for us, and it's not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| And so this machine was bought, and so the kids can learn how to design and cut metal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| and then they're able to grind and weld and whatever else they need to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| So we ended up starting last year for the metal sign business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Okay, so tell me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| So tell me about the metal signs and how you got started with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Well, it took a little bit to get this machine running right, and then once we got it running right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Mr. Thomas and I decided to make Mr. Berry, our head principal, a sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| and we did a split-letter monogram, the B with Berry in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| And I had one of the kids design it, actually, and then we cut it out, polished it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| painted it up, and took it to him, and he loved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| And he said, you guys need to be doing this for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| You need to be selling these to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| All right, well, let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| So just a couple of notes about the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| Jeff Wright is one of these teachers we talk about that can make so much more money in private industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| but, you know, he's here for all the right reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| And I love that they focus on kids, whether they want to immediately enter the workforce or, you know, go on to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| And they're all treated the same regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| They try to support them regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| And as for their metal sign business, it's actually taken off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| and I will share their Facebook page later tonight in this video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| It's a little bit longer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| And they use that money to help buy and purchase equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and things they need for those programs that we just don't have the money to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I believe this year they bought welding jackets, maybe, with the proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| And I really appreciate the thought process that's going into CTE now to make these pathways, you know, make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=572)|
| 0:09:42| and so the kids can excel and immediately enter the workforce if they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| And I know all their teachers are very appreciative of the support they get from the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| and Dr. Roslick and Dr. Wilson and everybody in the CTE department that helps make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| But I'll share those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| And also, while we're talking about CTE, I also want to give a shout out to our health science department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| because all of their CNA students passed their exam earlier this month, and they all got their certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| So 100% off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| All right, thank you so much, Ms. Christie, for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Love to see those things our kiddos are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Okay, and now it's time for the community health assessment report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| and so I would like to call on Dr. Buchanan and her team to give us an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=631)|
| 0:10:40| Okay, can somebody enable screen share for me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Let me share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Can you see a PowerPoint presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Let me make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Well, first of all, thanks so much for allowing me some time to share our 2019 community health assessment with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| You'll notice that we normally would have put this out earlier in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| but we were busy doing some other stuff, as were you, in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| So we finally are able to get this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| I'm really proud of being able to get this out in spite of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| So this is really one of our cornerstone publications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| and really is used throughout our community to help guide people in decision-making around health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=692)|
| 0:11:42| You all received a link to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| We also have hard copies if you'd like a hard copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| This is a report we produce every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Population health doesn't change all that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| We gather data from several different sources, some of which we get from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| Our youth behavior risk survey that we do in our middle schools and high schools every other year is part of the data that we have in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=720)|
| 0:12:10| Our team of epidemiologists analyzed the data and produced this report for our community to use in decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=730)|
| 0:12:19| I hope that you as a school board will use it to make decisions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| We really believe that in order to build a healthy community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| we need to raise awareness of health issues and what's making people sick and what's causing health problems in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=749)|
| 0:12:39| So we want this document to be used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| It's very carefully vetted by our staff to make sure it's very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| One of the things that I want to say is we're talking about vetting data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| During COVID, we have released data in a real-time way, which is something we don't normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| This report takes several months of work to make sure the data is accurate and can be used to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| That's also why we only do it every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| Covenant Health, for example, uses this report as part of their requirement for their Medicare certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=796)|
| 0:13:26| They are required to do a community health assessment, and they use our report for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| We're very pleased to be able to say that that doesn't happen in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| If you've seen this report before, one of the things we added that was new this year was the drivers of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| I'm talking about the things that contribute to our health that we might not think about contributing to our health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| such as socioeconomic factors, physical environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Obviously, we all think about health behaviors, but those decisions are made in an environment that might have some limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| You see that health care is part of the contributor, but it's only about 20 percent what contributes to good or bad health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| Each section has a lens through which you can look at how the drivers of health are beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| or not beneficial to that particular area of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| We're very aware that our health is tied to the economy and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| but the flip side is also true, that education and economy are tied to our health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| Healthy workers show up for work and are productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Healthy students show up for work and are present, are not work, show up for school and are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| So drivers of health are very important and very intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| So what are the next steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| The Community Health Council will take this document and select health priorities for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=891)|
| 0:14:59| and they will use that to create a community health improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| which is just a framework for community leaders and community organizations to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| to know what to focus on, what areas of health are of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| And that will result in implementation of some action plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| One of the things that came out of our last community health improvement plan is the All for an Ox movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| that is now implementing a strategic plan to address substance misuse in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| And I did want to try to share, we'll see if I can do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| there's some specific parts that I think will be of interest to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| and I can't figure out how to stop sharing my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| I'm not going to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| Okay, right now I can't figure out how to stop sharing my screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| so I'm not sure why I can't figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=960)|
| 0:16:09| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| So one of the areas, and I'm not going to be able to find it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| one of the areas that I think would be really interesting for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| we do include that data from a youth behavioral risk assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| And you can see some areas that we do really well in, we do really well with vaccination rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| but we don't do so great in areas of physical activity and in bullying and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=992)|
| 0:16:40| So I think you as a Board of Education, to look at those and see those trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| are they getting better, are they getting worse in our community, I think would be useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| I'm happy to answer any questions that you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1011)|
| 0:17:03| Anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Dr. Buchanan, so obviously there's a lot of great content in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| and one of the statements that you made is that you hope Knox County Schools will use this to help drive decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| You just pointed out one of the things that you want us to be paying attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| What are some of the other things that are in this report that we need to be really conscious of as Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| I'll tell you what, Roberta Sturm with my office is on the call, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| and Roberta is over at the department that produces this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| and she may be able off the top of her head to be able to talk about some of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| some of the findings that they've noticed in collating the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| So, Bert, do you mind taking that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Did you hear the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Yeah, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Just looking through the document, one of the things that really stands out to me is major depressive episodes among our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1077)|
| 0:18:13| In Knox County, we're doing a little bit worse than Tennessee and the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| I think that also coincides with bullying and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| but when you have a chance to look at this, that's one thing that stands out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| and I think that's something that historically has been a problem among our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1107)|
| 0:18:37| And just so you know, thinking about tobacco use, the question, I know vaping has really been big on the market lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| and the way that vaping was worded in the previous YRBS was about electronic cigarettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| and if you know anybody who does use those type of products, those are considered very different from the tools that you use to vape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| So in the next edition of the YRBS, that language has been changed so that that can be better captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Anything else, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Yes, Ms. Pab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Since you brought up the vaping, I'm just wondering, I mean, I look around, it doesn't seem like vaping is going on as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| Are we seeing any trends of it dying down, or maybe I'm just in a bubble and not seeing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| So I just wonder what y'all are seeing about vaping, because I know it was really bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| and I don't know if it's gotten worse, or if we're seeing it's getting better, or what y'all are seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| I think with this next iteration of the YRBS, we'll really be able to kind of tease out those trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| It looks like, so looking at just e-cigarette use, it looks like about almost 15 percent of our high schoolers use electronic cigarettes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1181)|
| 0:19:58| compared to about 12 percent of students in Tennessee and 13 in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| So we are higher than the state and nation in both of those regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| And as I can't really tell yet to see if, I won't know until I look more at this next iteration to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| is that trending up, is that trending down, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Okay, thank you both so much for the update. We appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Okay, we'll move now to discuss our regular session agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| Any questions on Contracts 1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| Oh, I'm sorry, just one minute before we go there. Thank you, Ms. Coatney, reminding me that I need to announce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1242)|
| 0:20:51| Yesterday, or you received an email today explaining that the final documents on Consent Agenda 5C2 were received from Knox County Purchasing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1251)|
| 0:21:02| and have been approved as to legal form by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| So that caption has been updated to reflect the change as well as the final documents attached to the electronic agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| So that's Item 5C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| Thank you, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Okay, so any questions on Items 1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Okay, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Yes, Mr. Thomas, I don't know who might be able to answer this, but I know with the legislation that's just passed in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| they've been talking a lot about phonics training and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| And as I'm seeing it, I'm assuming these are teacher prep programs that they're wanting to put teachers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| And I'm wondering if we're working with these programs and that they're getting up to speed on the correct kind of phonics training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1311)|
| 0:22:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| And I think probably Scott Bolton, our executive director for HR, can better address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1321)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| So Dr. Rice probably could give a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you, Madam Chair and the rest of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Probably a little more detail about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| He's been following it more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| But from what I understand, they have not written the specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| The specs will not go into this actual process until next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| So they're just kind of filling that out at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| I noticed that Walden is in Minneapolis, so I'm curious about the draw and the connection that we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| Am I looking at the right Walden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| Yes, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Madam Chair, yes, Mr. Watson, it is home-based there, but it is an online program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| So Walden does do kind of online self-paced, but it is a program where teachers can get certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1382)|
| 0:23:12| I was thinking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| And so is that heavily utilized in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Are we drawing people from Walden who are from this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| And typically what happens, you'll have a lot of nontraditional folks who come back to gain licensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| and a lot of times it's advantageous for them to go that pathway in terms of a virtual-type school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Okay, anything else on those two items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Moving on to five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| On number five, can someone tell us who this training is targeted for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Actually, the targeted audience will be any teacher who is interested in learning more about working with that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| So our ELL supervisor, Enid Fletcher, has done a really nice job of vetting this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| She sat through one of the trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| We're really excited to make it accessible to all of our Knox County Schools teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| so that they can learn more about working with that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Okay, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Moving on to seven or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| Okay, board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Policy A-100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| A-120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| B-111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| B-160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| G-460.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| I-381.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| Okay, and D-233.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| And just so the public knows, just one second, these policies, our board, the majority of our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| and the policy review team reviewed these policies a couple of weeks ago when we had policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| So that would be why there aren't very many questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| It was brought up in policy review, but I know there wasn't a lot of time to answer it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| and I'm curious if there's any more information on G-460.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| I know that that policy is going, I'm sorry, maybe I'm at the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| Sorry, D-233.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| My eyes are playing tricks on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Okay, around the purchasing policy for technology, I know it's going to create some additional staffing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| Do we have a sense of what that's going to be in terms of in order to implement that policy with fidelity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| Mr. Oakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| It's around this policy and around IT and property management altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| We have put together requests for two additional positions within the FY22 budget where we're going through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1574)|
| 0:26:29| I don't know if they will survive the budget process, but that's what we were looking at that we would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| and to do a little reorganization within our various departments to better align what we're doing with property acquisition and property management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1597)|
| 0:26:48| Yeah, thanks, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| This is more a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| When we go through the budget process, can we get a little information on, I mean, I know this has got to have been a huge job for our technology staff this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1613)|
| 0:27:03| Did we get some information during the budgeting process on how it's been this year with the number of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Because I know we were not prepared for them taking on the amount of technology work that they had to do, so that would be good to learn more about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1628)|
| 0:27:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| We can certainly put you some information together on that, and we'll look at how to get it back to you and how to communicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Okay, and also, the policy I-381 integration of TCAP and EOC scores, we did not, if I'm not mistaken, we did not discuss that in policy review because we got additional information, of course, after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1651)|
| 0:27:45| Since that policy is time-sensitive to the end of our semester and affects how student grades are factored in, and our teachers need this information as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1665)|
| 0:27:57| I would request that someone next week make a motion that we waive second reading on this policy so that our schools can move forward and do the business of determining how student grades are factored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1677)|
| 0:28:10| Is that anything else, Dr. Reiswick, that you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| I did have one question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| It says TCAP, but I thought it was TN Ready, and I was just wondering about is it really called TCAP now, or that was my only question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1697)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| TCAP is the program, TN Ready is the assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Okay, any other questions on that or any other policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| All right, moving to grants, any, let's see, this grant is the Knox Education Foundation, and Superintendent Thomas, would you like to share some information on that before we discuss this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1721)|
| 0:28:54| Yes, ma'am, Madam Chair, and thank you very much, and also Dr. Reiswick and Mr. Myers are here, too, to talk specifically about it, but just a few words before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1734)|
| 0:29:05| The LVAC program is just really great news for our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Very excited to share more about it with you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| It's a partnership between Knox County Schools, Knox County, the McNabb Center, and the Boyd Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| As we all know, substance abuse has become an increasingly difficult challenge in our community and across the country, and our students have certainly been affected by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| The LVAC program is designed, excuse me, to provide a place for students who are recovering from substance abuse or addiction to receive the social and emotional support they need to graduate and to maintain sobriety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1765)|
| 0:29:38| Participation is expected to begin in the fall of 2021, or this coming fall, with a class of approximately 10 students, and I believe this program represents an innovative, proactive approach to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1778)|
| 0:29:49| It's also been on the table for conversation over about the last three years, I know of, maybe four years, actually, when it first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| And I'm especially excited because our community partners have stepped up to the plate to make this strategy a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| The Boyd Foundation has provided a $150,000 grant through Knox Education Foundation to fund the startup cost for LVAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| while Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs has agreed to allocate money from the county budget to cover staffing for the program's first three years, an estimated annual expense of $89,866.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1812)|
| 0:30:25| So very grateful for the mayor, the mayor's help with funding, and also the Boyd Foundation with the startup cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| And the McNabb Center, they've agreed to provide classroom and meeting space for the program in addition to intensive outpatient therapy for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1832)|
| 0:30:41| So I've said many times that we simply cannot accomplish our mission without the support of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| This is another great example of how Knox County citizens and leaders are willing to support the district's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| I believe the LVAC program will not only help students make progress academically, but will also support their social and emotional well-being in all areas of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| And again, I'm very grateful for Randy and Jenny Boyd, for Mayor Jacobs, and the McNabb Center for their investment in our students and our school communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| as well as the many other community organizations for their support of this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| So again, just a great example of the community coming together to help solve a problem that is in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| So very appreciative of all the agencies that are helping with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| And looking forward to this program starting up in the fall of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Great. Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Yeah, I'm thrilled on that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And I was hoping that somebody could maybe just explain a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Is it going to be like a Paul Kelly-type situation, or kind of what the structure we're envisioning for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| Mr. Myers, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Yeah, I can speak a little bit about the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Obviously, the team that's working to put this together, now that we know we've secured funding and we're going to be launching the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| will obviously do a lot of that more specific work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| But currently, it's going to be unlike really anything we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Currently, the plan would be for students to report to the site around noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| They would have lunch, which Homeros McNabb is working to provide that lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| At that time, they would participate in their therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| And then at 4 o'clock, the academic part would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| We do plan to leverage our new online platforms to help provide that instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| and then use staff to support the learning is going to be the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| We also plan to have security on site and an administrator on site as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| And we think it will be at the McNabb Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| They have allocated us a space in one of their facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and its name totally escapes me right now, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| But I can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Do we have any sense of possible number of students that we might think might participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| We've actually planned to try to recruit 10 students for this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| Again, we're focusing on a pilot, so we want to make sure that the programming is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Our hope would be to slowly expand that every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| and we plan to work with Helen Ross McNabb and the juvenile court system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| to identify students who may be appropriate candidates for the Elevate program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| I love that we're doing more of this public-private partnership stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| I think any time we can get into that space is really, really good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| and love all the investment that is coming for this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| especially with the dual nature of this that we're both trying to help affect young people's sobriety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| but we're also trying to affect their academics, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| And it's a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| How do we envision, or in what are some of the ways that we envision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| that this will measure success of this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Well, I think you've hit the nail on the head, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| We want to look as closely as we can monitor those data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| Are we going to have situations where students relapse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| And then obviously we can definitely manage tracking their academic data as they move forward as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| We know we hold the keys to those data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| But certainly we'll be looking at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| I know that the Boyd Foundation is interested in us collecting those data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and how we'll collect those data is work that that team will be moving forward with now that we know that it's a go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| Yeah, I love when we're at that point for those goals and those metrics to be shared with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| so we can get a sense of how it's progressing and how we're meeting those goals long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| So you talked about recruiting 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Do we know how this is going to be marketed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Market is not the right word, but how are we going to attract kids to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Again, we'll work with the Juvenile Court and Helen Ross McNabb to identify students who potentially would fit the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| And then the plan is really to kind of narrowly focus in on those individual families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| and speak to them about what we believe the benefits of such a program could be for their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| and what I guess the daily walk of that program would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| And if a student graduates from this program, they'll be graduating really from a base school, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| So it's not its own school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| We're identifying it as a program, so any student who were to be served through that program upon their graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| let's say if that was the terminal year, their diploma would be from their base school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| And would not mention something like Elevate Program or something on it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| No, sir, transcripts, diplomas, none of that would say Elevate Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| I think it's a huge benefit and I also want to be conscious about the potential stigma that comes from you graduated from the, you know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you all for your work on this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| Great, good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Okay, moving on to, let's see, where were we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| Grants, this would be B or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| Okay, any questions on D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Okay, moving to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| Questions on C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| E or L?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Yes, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| I had a question on D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| So I've had that app where I get to track where my daughter is, which I think is awesome that we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| Is this a different system or is this a renewal of a system we've used in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| And do we have any sense of how much it's being used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Because I know it took me a while to even figure out that we had that technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| So I guess I'm trying to understand about the use of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I can tell you it's a different system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| And we expect it will be more functional than the system we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| What I'd like to do, if it's okay with the chair, is let Mr. Dillingham, our transportation director, talk to the details a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2227)|
| 0:37:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Mr. Dillingham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| To answer your specific question, this is a different system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| We used a system called SafeStop previously, and they went out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| So we have had nothing for this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| This is our attempt to find something to fill that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| We currently use Edulog as the routing system that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| And so it will pair more favorably with our routing system easier, gives us some additional functionality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| and able to kind of do a little bit more for our parents is our hope than just be able to show them where the bus is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Do we have a sense of how much the old system was utilized compared to, like, total number of students who are using buses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| I mean, do we have any sense of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| So we maxed out at about 2,000 users, 2,000 unique users, based on with SafeStop you essentially signed up with a child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2286)|
| 0:38:15| and you had a unique username and password.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| So that's the number of unique username and passwords that were used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| But, you know, if you for your daughter gave it to her grandparents to use as well, that's four people using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| We're going to see one username.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| And then I also want to encourage that as we get into this system that Carly and her fantastic team does some really good marketing around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| Because I think it's a great tool that was probably underutilized both because it was a little bit glitchy before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| but also I just don't think people knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you, Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Any other questions for Mr. Dillingham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Questions on F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| I'm not trying to ask all the questions tonight, but I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| So I read through the details of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| Russ, do we have any concern at this point that that $19 million we might exceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| I'd certainly appreciate the desire to give a maximum price post-design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| but I'm also curious if we have any sense of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| At this point, it's a little early to tell if the construction cost will definitely exceed $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2372)|
| 0:39:42| And I know that the county is going back through and looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| Right now, the initial cost that we got in was a little over $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| I think there's an expectation that as we get to 100% design, they'll be able to pull that down some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| I can tell you that the total project cost, though, will be more than $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| So we'll have to address that in the FY22 capital plan as we go through that process this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| And I think that was something that was brought up to the board just a couple months ago as we were discussing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Mr. Oaks, you should have sat on the front row tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| You're getting your exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| I'm a good Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Any questions on G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Russ, I shouldn't have had you sit back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| Just so the public knows, the board received 2,000 pages for this agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| 1,400 of them was this contract, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| So I'm certainly not completely well versed in all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| I only have two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| One is do we have any sense of how long this conversion will take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| And then also, I know we're paying for it out of savings, which I think is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| But have we looked into additional opportunities to actually pay for some of it up front through grants associated with this type of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| Because I know this is one of the things that, you know, over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| there's been more opportunity to receive funding for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| You asked about six questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| I'm trying to get the answers lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Really just two about how long will it take, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| And I'll jump into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| But Owen Novotter from TRAIN is here tonight, too, if we want to get into any of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| But we anticipate that the implementation of it will take a couple of years to get through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| And what this does, you know, you said you had 1,400 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And if you go into those 1,400 pages, it basically shows you every light fixture that's going to be changed in the district and where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| This will get us to an LED program in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| It will also include all of our parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| It will include our stadiums and athletic facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| So the lighting that we'll have at the conclusion of this process won't compare to what we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2536)|
| 0:42:26| And it will be paid for through savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| Plus we also anticipate through this program that TRAIN guarantees the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| We anticipate about a $97,000 positive cash flow to us after the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| But that's just the top part of it because when we look at what we do in maintenance with fluorescent tubes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| and what we have to change and the work that we have to do between what we pay for fluorescent tubes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| and disposal of fluorescent tubes and the manpower, we expect to save something around $400,000 a year once the program is in place just in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2579)|
| 0:43:11| As far as grant funding, we've not looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| We've looked at a lease program, and we've also looked at municipal bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| And that's sort of in the hands of the county how they would like to move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| But right now where the discussion is is that we would do it through municipal bonds and reflect it in our capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I just wanted to say that if our TRAIN representatives would like to say anything, I'd like to give them that opportunity if they have any additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2622)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Since they are here, we may as well hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Nice to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I appreciate you entertaining us and this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| And if there's any questions at all, feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| And I'll apologize up front for the 1,400 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| It's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| I didn't feel any pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| It's been a really, really good program for everyone since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| And it's based on transparency and everyone working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| It's not all about TRAIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Your energy manager is sitting out here, and he's got a lot of skin in this game for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| Mr. Tipton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Owen, I want you to guarantee increased student achievement with better lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| So if you would do that before you step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| I think you all will be pretty pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| That's what I needed to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| That goes right along with our strategic plan then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| We appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Ms. Satterfield, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| You have a question on H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| More of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| So now that we have this warehouse center in our backyard, I will just want to publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| encourage and push Knox County Schools to continue to build those private partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| because I do think that this is a great opportunity for our scholars to be exposed to the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| of something that they really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| So I hope that we can see that type of business with the Amazon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| I know this is a business contract, but moving forward in the future, I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| because it's in a district that close to districts that can really use that type of CTE type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| And Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| So I know this is for the business contract, but also having a business contract myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| with Amazon, do we also get the benefit of prime with this contract or are we not buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| into that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| And to save on shipping and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| I think prime is included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210203?start=2769)|
