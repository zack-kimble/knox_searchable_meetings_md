| 0:01:40| to exercise the right of free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=100)|

| 0:02:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| All right, so we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| I know Mr. Holtquist is planning on coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| He had an accident yesterday but is doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| Let me start out quickly before I go over the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| I just want to thank all the members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| We've been discussing the agenda of this meeting by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| I want to appreciate everybody's input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| I think we have an agenda that I don't think anybody is 100% happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| And I understand there were even some questions that came up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| I didn't get a chance to read my e-mail today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| So we might actually talk about that briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| I want to especially thank Councilman Hall for helping to set up one of the presentations we've had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| For folks in the audience, this is a workshop on the proposal to repeal the ban on guns in city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=201)|
| 0:03:31| We are not voting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| This is a workshop for council to hear from the public and to have a more in-depth discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| We will be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| Could I just clarify the one statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| You said we've been discussing the agenda by the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| You've been discussing the procedures for addressing the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| And you've been discussing the scheduling for it, but you have not discussed the substance of what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| I just want that to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| And it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| There was nothing snuck into any of the e-mails that even tried to go into substance on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| It was all agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| We will be voting on this ordinance at our September 22nd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| It's a Tuesday night, 7 o'clock in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| My understanding is that it will take two votes of council to pass this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| and it takes five votes of the nine council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| There are not nine council members there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| It still takes five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| I'd like to go over the agenda now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Now, technically, while we have rules for council discussion at council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| we actually don't have rules for workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| So I'm going to go over what I've proposed, and if people are comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| that will be the rules for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| The agenda that's going to happen is we're going to start out with a presentation from each side for 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=292)|
| 0:05:01| a pro-repeal and an anti-repeal, 15 minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| Then there's set 30 minutes for council discussion, and then there's public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| And the way public forum is set up is as many people as want to are allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| You can sign up over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| We'll take just from the top of this list to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| And each speaker gets three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| I have a timer here, and I have little cards to let you know when you have one minute left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| and when your time's up to try and keep that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| That's the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Questions do not count in those times, so if there's a presentation and there's a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| that actually doesn't count from your three minutes or your 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| I'm going to ask council members to try and keep questions during the presentation only to clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| And if we get to issue stuff, we can pick on that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| And I know there's some discussion, again, that I did not see on e-mails today about the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| So I don't know which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| I saw Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| There's a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| I'll address one, and maybe Councilwoman Pilo will address the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| One of the e-mails that Mr. Bailey sent yesterday regarding the procedure of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| was where to place on our agenda the peace-addressing public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| And Mrs. Pilo sent a reply today agreeing with Councilman Bailey's opinion, and I concurred as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=380)|
| 0:06:32| Councilman Pilo said very well that she feels, and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| that the public's input into this discussion is incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| And, you know, typically at council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| we listen to the comments from the public and the speakers that have signed up before we get into deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| And I realize that we will have additional time to deliberate on this matter when it comes to a vote next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| But I, for one, would prefer to hear a public forum before city council discussion on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=415)|
| 0:07:05| Ms. Pilo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Well, I won't repeat what Councilman Roddy has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| but I know that she and I share the very same convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| I have a strong conviction about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Frankly, I think it's a disservice to the public for us to have our discussion prior to listening to their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=436)|
| 0:07:24| I always learn a great deal from the comments I hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| and it's very important to me not to be discussing this in any way prior to hearing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| So I would like to see the agenda revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| And it's unfortunate you didn't get to see our comments earlier today because we were trying to alert you to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| Mr. Holland and Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Well, I do completely understand where you're coming from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| but it's my understanding that there could be a possible potential compromise that's discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| And if that actually takes place after we've heard the public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| they will not have had the opportunity to make comments on the potential compromises that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=485)|
| 0:08:13| And so with this particular agenda that Vice Mayor Becker has laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| that does give them the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| And then at any point, we can come back in at the very end and discuss again if it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| And it may not need 30 minutes for the council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| But I feel I, like you, think that we should listen to all the comments from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| but they ought to be to where we can hear their comments on what is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| And at this point right now, there is no compromise on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| It's either you're for my ordinance or you're opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| That's all that's out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| And so if we have the public comment section, that's all they'll be addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| I was going to agree with Councilman Filo and Roddy, and then you spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| I think it's worthwhile to have the people definitely speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| but also perhaps respond and adjust their statements based upon what they've heard us say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| Let me cut in, because let me say in planning the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| my thinking was that there had been talk of a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| and I didn't want a situation where we were talking about something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| and people didn't have a chance to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| I have no problem if we want to readjust the agenda, but I actually agree with Mr. Hall on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| If we don't, and I don't mean to interrupt, if we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| then we stand the opportunity of needing another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| But let me go, Mr. Bailey and then Ms. Pieloman, let me say first for process-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| my sense is we should take a vote on this, that we just need to decide what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| So let me ask Mr. Bailey to speak, and then Ms. Pilo, Mr. Frost has his light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| and then we will vote what we want to do on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| So, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| I said in the e-mail that I value the public's input, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| they're our most valuable resource, and that's who we work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| So I think, first and foremost, we should be listening to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| And, furthermore, I think we should set some rules, just like we have rules for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| because, you know, we've gone back and forth here recently on changing the agenda for workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| and for public forums, so I think we ought to get together, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| and set some rules for the future that will be set in place so we'll always know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| and the public will know and they can base their schedule around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| Also, we do have a vote in two weeks from this Tuesday, and then it will be heard twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| So I think there's plenty of time, ample time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| and I'm sort of over here thinking about what I should say or not say and when to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| And so I still think we should put the public forum before we have our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=667)|
| 0:11:16| Ms. Pilo, and then Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Well, I'll just say thank you, Mr. Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| but that has not changed my position on the wisdom of hearing the public first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| And should there be a compromise proposed, that's the kind of discussion I would expect to come from public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=688)|
| 0:11:38| It would not surprise me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| It does surprise me that some of you were aware of that possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| and others of us have not been included in those comments or emails or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| however you determined that there might be a possibility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| So I'll have to tell you that my comments have either been for or against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| and I have not had the opportunity to hear about a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| So it's more important to me than ever to hear the public first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| The compromise was mentioned when the workshop was talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| And that's all I've heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| I realize that I've heard nothing to indicate that anyone is interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| It's either being yay or nay in terms of the emails I've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| So I just wanted to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| Ms. Roddy, and then I'll comment, and then eventually we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| I concur with Councilman Bailey that should a compromise, whatever that might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| and I certainly don't know anything either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| I think I was the one that used that word when I asked for the workshop at the last council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| and asked for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Should something like that come up, I agree with Councilman Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| that I would see it appropriate to be debated in the two meetings hence on first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| and second reading when this would come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| I guess just, Ms. Roddy, to comment, my thinking is we're having a workshop tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| and I'd rather talk about all the issues and hear from the public on all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| which is why I want to stick with the agenda we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| But that's a call council has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| So let me ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| I guess this is the simple way to ask it is all those folks in favor of changing the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| to move public forum before city council discussion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| I think I'm going to ask for a roll call on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=808)|
| 0:13:37| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Those opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I'd like to ask are you in favor of changing the agenda to allow public forum before council discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Councilman Pelau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| So what we'll do, I guess the presentations can happen and we'll just sort of call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=851)|
| 0:14:22| part of public forum, since they were sort of designed a little differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| What I think we will do is hear from the, I guess there were seven people planned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| the presentations, Mr. Hall, and then we'll start the public forum list, if that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| because the folks who were set for the presentations actually would have signed up to speak, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| we're told not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| So my inclination is to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Does that make sense, folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Before we start on that, let me ask Chairman Hall, who's the maker of this motion, if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| has anything he wants to say at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| No, I think we've pretty much hashed it out already tonight, just on the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| So I'm ready to get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| We have two speakers on the pro-repeal, which are Mike Mullenauer and Benton Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| And if you all can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| And then we actually have four, I believe, on the anti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| Mr. Mullenauer and Mr. Bryan have 15 minutes between you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Please state your name and address and proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I am Mike Mullenauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| I live at 106 Mayflower Drive in South Knoxville, a good evening council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| By the way, Mr. Becker, if you're timing this, I would appreciate if you would just raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| your hand, maybe wave at me, if I hit seven and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| I'm trying to reserve some time for Mr. Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| That's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| I not only live here in South Knoxville, I've lived here for roughly 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| I've raised four children here, three of whom still live here, by the way, one of whom I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| hope will live here again when she comes back from the Peace Corps in about a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| We played ball, soccer, softball, baseball, spent a lot of Saturday mornings and Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| afternoons in various parks around town, and I couldn't even recall all of the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| You know how that is sometimes with the summertime blur of the parenting and sports frenzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| By the way, in all of that time, with all those deadly weapons lying on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| and I mean Louisville Sluggers and not Lukers, I never saw anybody get brained in any of those games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| I'm here tonight speaking on behalf of a group of people, and if it's permissible with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| I'm going to ask these people to stand up right now just so that you can see who's come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| and who's with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Would you do that, all who are here supporting the repeal motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| This is the group of people who the gun-free zone kinds of ordinances and legislation is aimed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1025)|
| 0:17:14| There's a more broad feeling among a lot of people that what they really don't want in parks is guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| but they can't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| We know they can't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| They can ban guns, but they can't necessarily keep guns out of the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| Criminals don't pay any attention to the dotted lines and the boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| It's this group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| It's not even actually gun owners in general whom these kinds of ordinances are aimed at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| because, as we all know, if you don't have a handgun carry permit, it would still be unlawful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| for people to carry guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| I think it's worthwhile just to see the variety and the kinds of folks that you're really talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| because it probably surprises you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| We're a pretty quiet group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Almost everyone carries concealed almost all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and you wouldn't really know who's sitting next to you in church with a gun in a personal pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| I've met, by the way, some really nice people, so I'm thanking our opponents on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| I've never met so many good gun owners in Knoxville before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| because we pretty much keep to ourselves and do our things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Having said all of that, I'd like to get right down to the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| because we all have limited time and a lot of people want to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| So if you'll permit me, let me just launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| What I want to do, I thought a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| I thought, why is it that responsible and well-meaning and intelligent people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| can have such emotional reactions to the presence of a firearm or gun ownership in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| or to this issue, and why is it that people like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| who favor the right to keep and bear arms in practice and in practicality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| not just a theoretical right, are passionate about these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| And there are good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| A lot of this plays to fears, people's fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| So I want to address a little bit right now about some of the opposition's fears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| because, like I said, the people that you just saw are likely to be sitting next to you in Riverview Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| They're likely to be walking by at Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| They're likely to be sitting now that the law has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| they might be sitting next to you at Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| So who are these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Not just the folks you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| There are almost, at this point, a quarter of a million handgun carry permit holders in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| That's pretty impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| There were 30,000, I'm approximating, 30,000 new permit applications last year alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1184)|
| 0:19:53| I didn't know that until I got into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| There are 34 other states which recognize our permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| And, by the way, we recognize them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| The point here is that the number of permit holders who might be carrying a gun in the state at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| is vastly larger even than the quarter of a million people who are Tennessee citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| So guns aren't going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| So how did all of this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| A little bit of history, I think, is necessary as I try to address some of these fears that I think need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| The crime rates in the 1950s began, they were very stable and very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| I'm looking here at Department of Justice Bureau of Statistics numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| This is the era in which, legendarily, we left our doors open and didn't lock our cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| They began to rise in the mid-60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| By the time they had hit the 70s and peaked in 1980, people were alarmed about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| The states began to react.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Only a few states at that point in time had actual right-to-carry kind of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| And a few more came up with it and passed right-to-carry bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| And then Florida undertook the issue in 1987, and somehow this got to the national attention and the furor began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1266)|
| 0:21:16| And I remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| You know, the word was among the left that we were going to have blood in the streets and the wild,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| wild west in Florida and in other states if this kind of thing happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| Florida passed its legislation anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Crime peaked four years later and then began to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| Tennessee passed its right-to-carry law in 1994, and crime has continued to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| Now, I'm not trying to say that handgun-carry legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| and permit holders with guns caused a drop in crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| I'm saying it correlates, and I'm saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| It cannot be proven or even credibly argued that armed citizens are dangerous in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1314)|
| 0:22:05| I've got a couple of letters here, and I'm going to read from a couple of comments that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| These are comments that you've seen, too, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| One opponent writes, while respecting every citizen's Second Amendment right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| we believe that these parks should be safe as a haven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| should be as safe a haven as possible for all citizens intent on recreation and relaxation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| and the presence of hidden firearms seems directly contradictory to that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| It may seem that way, but factually it isn't, or at least it can't be proven or supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1354)|
| 0:22:44| This writer continues to write in a letter that I know you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Besides, in the rare and unfortunate instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| when an altercation of criminal substance occurs in a park or greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| we are confident in the talents and the abilities of the Knoxville Police Department to handle the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| You know, I am confident in our Knoxville Police Department officers as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| and I support them wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| They are great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Responding to the knife-point carjacking that I personally witnessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| while eating lunch at Ruby Tuesday's with my son only about six weeks ago on Chapman Highway near Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| the police were there within minutes, but the carjacking was already over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| This writer is sadly mistaken to believe that even as fine a department as the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you, fellas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| is either omniscient or can be omnipresent, and I know that you on council know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| and I know when you read this, you probably saw this as an emotional and unfounded response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| I hope you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| The status of right-to-carry laws now is such that 48 states have some form of right-to-carry law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| Some of those states don't even address the parks issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| It's simply right-to-carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Two states and Washington, D.C. say no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| And if you know anything about Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| I'll read here very briefly from an article in the Washington Examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| It just came out in April of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Violent crime in the district rose sharply in the first half of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| while the rest of the country saw a decrease during that same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Documents show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Now, hopefully with the Heller decision and Washington, D.C.'s hands being slapped big time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| that will turn around, but it's going to take years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| To leave the crime situation for a minute and to ask about another point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| I don't know, if some of these fear concerns that aren't really well identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| have to do simply with general safety, here are a couple of facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Over the last hundred years, firearms accidents have plummeted to an all-time low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| to the point that at this point, firearms accidents account for roughly one-half percent of accidental deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| I said one-half of one percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| To try to wrap it up, one candidate for city council told me, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| I feel safe in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Well, generally speaking, council, so do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Generally speaking, I expect everybody in here does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Generally speaking, I feel safe on our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| or I'd try to pick a new city where it was a safer place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Generally speaking, you know, I feel safe almost anywhere and almost at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| although I've told my kids, you know, not much good happens out there after about 10, 30, or 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| and it's probably a good idea to be home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| But I suspect that that married couple on Washington Pike a few months back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| they were trying to watch a DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| It was in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Do you remember this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Saturday night, doors open, trying to watch a DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Back in May, there was a home invasion robbery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| But I bet they felt safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| I suspect that Channon Christian and Christian Newsome felt safe as they walked out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| and went to their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| But they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| I bet that only two weeks ago, the people who were enjoying the Lonsdale Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| were shocked to find that there was a shotgun shooting there that you may or may not even know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| And I say that because I caught this very briefly on KnoxNews.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| which promised a follow-up on Friday, and then that story disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| And there was no more detail about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| That didn't involve a handgun carry permit holder either, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| It involved a criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| I bet the stepdad in California thought his little girl was safe as she walked out to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| You see my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I feel generally safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| But to believe always that there aren't monsters walking around out there among us is an illusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| And it's an illusion that most of your handgun carry permit holders don't share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| So to the extent that the fears of violence and crime and those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| are directed at these people who stood up is misdirected fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| And so I'm asking you that as you deliberate whatever form these motions might take or compromises might take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1636)|
| 0:27:24| that you do so simply with very calm deliberation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| and maybe even having to rethink some of your own history with firearms or lack of a history with firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| Because I think that probably accounts for a lot of the feeling that some people might abhor guns in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| And that then gets projected over onto the people who lawfully and safely are carrying weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Mr. Bryan, I hope I've left you some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1671)|
| 0:27:59| Please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| I'm Benton Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| I live at 9158 Great Point Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| I am the third generation of my family to run a factory in the old city on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| So I'm very, very familiar with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| As a matter of fact, I've ridden my bicycle most days at lunch from the Kansler Y all the way to the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| and back down the greenways and the park areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| So I'm very familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| I think tonight you're going to hear a lot of talk about the Second Amendment and the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| and free men's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| But just for a minute, let's set that aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Let's put all that aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Washington does a good job of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| So let's just set it aside right now for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| I'm going to offer you some paradigm shifts in your thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| And let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| How many of the council members have done a citizen's ride-along in a cruiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| with a police officer in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| It is a very eye-opening experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| And having done so myself, you see the city in a different light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| And I've got to tell you, these are the bravest men I know is a police officer with what they deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1751)|
| 0:29:24| There have been past comments about city council being unenlightened, and I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| Possibly you're not necessarily informed on the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| But I'm going to offer you a paradigm shift, and that is their job is to protect and serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| on the side door of most cruisers in most cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| But I'll offer you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| The police cannot protect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| As good as they are, as well-trained as they are, they cannot protect you or your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| The blue lights show up after the rape, after the shooting, after the stabbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| If this were not true, all right, Vidar and Delfina Lillilid and their family would still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Shannon Christian and Chris Newsome might still be here, as good as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| I challenge you with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| It is incumbent upon this body, all right, it is not only your fiduciary responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| but your moral responsibility to educate and empower your people to protect themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| That's your job, all right, not to limit or hinder their ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Independent of the Constitution, that's your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| That's our job as a father to teach my children to protect themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| As surely as you believe there is goodness in this world, you must believe there is evil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| and it's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Is there any doubt, because it's right below our feet, ladies and gentlemen, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| the police cannot protect you or your children or your grandchildren| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| from the same bloodthirsty savages that systematically carjacked, raped, tortured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| and dismembered those two kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| A firearm is a tool that might put me on an even platform with savages like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1878)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| On the con side of the repeal, Willie Anderson was signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| but my understanding is he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| So we have Will Skelton, Victor Berry, Gordon Catlett, and Captain Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1904)|
| 0:31:53| So Mr. Skelton, and I'm going to wave this around since there are more people speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| I'm going to give you all the yellow card after you've used three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| and that should take less than 15 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| State your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Okay, my name is Will Skelton, 4064 Kingston Park Drive in Knoxville, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| By way of personal background, I'm speaking both for myself and for Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| By way of personal background, I served in the Marine Corps in the late mid to late 1960s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| had infantry training, officer training, so I'm a bit familiar with guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| but I still come down tonight on the side of some restrictions on guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| With regard to Legacy Parks initially, of course, it's a group that was founded to help the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| and the county with parks and greenways, particularly in the acquisition of lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| and easements and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I think most of you are familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| And it's their position essentially that we should keep the support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| we should keep the band that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| It's worked well, and it's their position, which they adopted by a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| that we keep that position in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| From my personal standpoint, I think there's a time and a place for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| You know, we can't say that, you know, you can do anything, anywhere, anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| There ought to be some restrictions, frankly, on just about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| And guns, I think, is particularly one of the things that ought to be restricted now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| and then in some times and places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| And from my standpoint, parks and greenways are clearly one of those places that it ought to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| that ought to be restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Now, you can say there ought to be a compromise and maybe unused parks or unused greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| or greenways in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| But our greenways, if you think about it, if you go out and use them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| they're used as much as most of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Ten thousand people a month use one of our greenways, and all of them are used by lots of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| So I don't think you can just segregate out greenways and say, well, these aren't used that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| and, therefore, we should allow guns on those greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| So I think you've got to lump them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| We've gotten along well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| I understand 30 years the current band has been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| So what's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| What's broken that we have to fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| What's the problem that's causing us to need a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| I haven't seen any issues or problems or anything happening in our parks or greenways that say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| we've got to change something that's worked well for 30 years, 30 plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| So I would suggest that we ought to leave that alone and leave it like it is and leave the ban in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| Forty cities have opted out of the state law, so we're not the only ones that have done it and are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| And, of course, a lot of others are considering opting out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| All the groups that I know of that are involved with parks and greenways that have basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| like the Greenways Commission, the county parks group and all that, they've all said no parks, no guns in greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| So, basically, bottom line is it's worked well for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| Let's leave it like it is and not allow guns in our greenways and in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Victor Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| And, again, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2130)|
| 0:35:40| My name is Victor Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| I live at 1507 Salahoma Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| I've been involved with youth sports in Knoxville, often on for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| The last eight years, I've served as commissioner of Bearden Youth Sports Baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| and have coached football at BYS for the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| During my years of volunteering in youth sports, there have been several emotional confrontations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| between adults which I have had to intervene and calm or resolve a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| but none more scary than one at our park six or seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| And that's the story I'd like to share with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| As two teams of 9- and 10-year-old children finished a baseball game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| and two teams of 11- and 12-year-olds were entering to play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| I went on to the field along with them to check on our umpires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| As I got to the backstop, I heard a man yelling and cussing at a woman from the other team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| No, you don't see this kind of thing often, but every season there is at least one outburst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| that I have to step in and deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| I immediately confronted the man from the other side of the backstop, thank goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| and told him we didn't allow that language around children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| At that time, there were 40 to 50 children in earshot of his words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| so I told him who I was and that he needed to calm down and leave the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| Then he turned his anger toward me as we continued to walk to the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| He continued to cuss and threaten me over the three- to four-minute walk to the exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| His problem, apparently, was that one child from the other team had pushed his child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| as the team shook hands crossing the field after the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Now, please understand that I have no problem with guns in the home to defend your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| but guns in the hands of some will turn deadly in certain situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| I don't own a handgun because I have an 11-year-old at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| I don't carry a weapon around him, and I don't want anyone else carrying a weapon around him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| There are hundreds of gun-related accidents that injure or kill children every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| that could have been avoided if these guns were not around those children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| It's just not worth the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| There was a shooting in our city a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| between two men after a heated confrontation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Man A shot and killed Man B because he thought his life was in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| Man A had a permit to carry his weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| But, you know, that day in our park, I thought my life might be in danger, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| and I was just trying to prevent a fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| After getting the angry man out of our park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I returned to the other group of parents to see what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| In that group of parents was Man A from our recent shooting in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| His son played on that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Was he carrying a weapon then? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| But if I had not been there so fast to intervene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| could something worse have happened in front of all those children in the park playing baseball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| Do we really want our stamp of approval on possible situations like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Even our governor has advised local governments to opt out of this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| for parks where children gather to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I'm not asking you to take away anyone's constitutional right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Protect yourself where you need to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| But my prayer is that at a Little League game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| the only protection that you would need is a helmet and a glove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Gordon Catlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Good evening, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| And Gordon Catlett, Knoxville Police Department, 800 Howard Baker Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| I'd like to start by saying thank you for the kind comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| that have been made tonight regarding our police department and our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Counsel, what I've left for each and every one of you is a packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| as I've been asked to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| to provide you with information pertaining to crime reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| and arrests in city parks, city greenways, and city rec centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| And this packet that I've given you covers a time period between 2005 through July of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2371)|
| 0:39:39| And within that packet, what you'll find is each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| or each page represents one year of study from crime analysis data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| And I've had the information put in terms on the left side of the column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| in descending order alphabetically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| incidents that were reported in these parks or greenways in common language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| where hopefully anyone could understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| Columns directly to the right of that represent arrest reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| crime reports, and a grand total of both types of reports added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| You'll also note, as you scan over this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| that I've highlighted some of the particular incidents for each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| But as I went through the report myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| I thought that you might deem to be important and wish to discuss further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2418)|
| 0:40:32| To be able to obtain this data, what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| what our crime analysis unit did for us was they identified 143 different street locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| that could be associated with a city park, greenway, or rec center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| This is the way that crime analysis information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| crime reports is captured by the CAD system that 911 uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| And we're able to categorize that information by location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| which is address oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Does that mean that all these incidents are directly related from the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| No, but they do have an address that corresponds with the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| To give you an example, it could be an address that is the roadway in front of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| not participants that are actually in the park at the time that the incident occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| And there are some incidents that are captured that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| But in an effort to capture as much data as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| we didn't want to narrow the scope of the study too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| and possibly lose information that is relevant to park criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| Does Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you, Captain Catlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| These statistics, they're not broken down to times of day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| whether it occurred at 1 in the afternoon or 1 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| This is a 24-hour cycle for 365 or however many days with a leap year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| So, I mean, for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| one aggravated assault could have occurred at 1 in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| and one could have occurred at 1 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| From what we have, we just don't know the time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Well, on the incidents that are highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| we actually brought the report with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| So if we wanted to look at that much detail for each of the highlighted incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| we could go into more detail and find out exactly what time of day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| what the location was, and what was relevant to the aggravated assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| What I found in most of these aggravated assaults were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| is it occurred between individuals that knew each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| had previous association with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| and the aggravated assault was by way of a motor vehicle in one instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| Another instance was a type of leg that was used as a weapon and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Now, we have miles and miles of greenways and we have hundreds of acres of parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2566)|
| 0:42:55| For sake of argument, how do they compare to, say, for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| parking lot at Westtown Mall, parking lot at Easttown Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| parking lot out at Turkey Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Are they, if you know, the same, less than, equal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| How do they compare in terms of number of crimes committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| whether it's against a person or property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| Well, Councilman, I believe that the numbers fairly well speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| We're talking about 143 different locations that we can associate a crime report back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| in a 365-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| And looking at the data from 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| grand total of all arrest reports and all crime reports for these 143 locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| we recorded 107 incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| That's not one incident per location for once during a year time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| That's extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| And just to be clear, that's all crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| That includes truancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| It includes intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| It includes parole violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| It includes everything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Well, and from that 2009 report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| the most predominant crime type is consistent with crime type throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| which is vehicle burglaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| You'll notice on that last page of 2009 that the vehicle burglary section had 14 reported crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| for a 365-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| And that's consistent with our property crime citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Crimes of opportunity where people are passing by and they see valuables left in a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| And they take advantage of that when no one's looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Other questions for the captain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| In decent exposure, what are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| These incidents were related to police officer proactive activity by undercover officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| responding to citizen complaints that dealt with inappropriate activity in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| And what we did is we put officers out in plain clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| And these officers were approached by individuals that were pursuing a sexual encounter in a public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| and, as a result, exposed themselves to a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| And it has nothing to do with somebody taking a bathroom break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| I've got the details on the arrest report, too, Councilman, if you'd like to take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Just kind of following up on Councilman Frost's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| You don't have any kind of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| First of all, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| We have curfews in our parks, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| And what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| It's at dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| When it gets dark is when the parks close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Some parks are actually posted with a closure time on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Do you have any kind of sense that are these offenses occurring after dark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| I mean, you don't have that kind of data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Just on the highlighted incidents themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| I've actually brought that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Now, we can get that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| If you'd like to see each one of these incidents graphed out or charted out by time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| We can get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| It is true in your experience that parks are used when they're supposed to be closed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| And that there is criminal activity during those times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| That's most often when a police officer is getting involved in a park as a result of a citizen call for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| That's usually when we find a lot of our order maintenance issues at a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| People that are drinking in a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| They're loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| They're boisterous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| They generate a call for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Officers go out and find out that they've been drinking or they've been smoking marijuana or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| On the last page here, on 2009, there's, I think if I'm reading this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| three robberies and then the one right above it, the forcible sodomy and oral sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Did those actually occur in a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| The forcible sodomy did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| And the specifics to it, I've got a copy of the actual report here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| I don't know if we necessarily need to go into the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| I just was curious if it happened inside a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| The robberies, however, did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| The majority of these robberies actually happened at a location near the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| And once I read the crime report itself, it wasn't associated to someone who was in the park at the time that they were robbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| If somebody calls in and we're talking about parks and something has happened on a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2861)|
| 0:47:50| which these greenways, some of them, you know, they're pretty elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| They don't, you know, how is that classified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| Would it be, is it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Well, and this is a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| A greenway is a good example because a lot of greenway actually adjoins private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| So if the incident occurred on the private property, no, it wouldn't be associated back to the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| Even if the person that, say, was assaulted was on a greenway and then moved into my backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2895)|
| 0:48:27| and I don't have a greenway running through my backyard, but if I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| would it be at my address or would it be classified as happening on the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| It would be classified in the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| It would be where the crime itself took place, the nearest street address to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Because you brought up a good point, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| The stretch of greenway by block doesn't have its own street address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| So the only way that 9-1-1 can correlate that information back to an actual address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| is an existing 9-1-1 address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| We just don't have the capability to use GPS latitude, longitude to pinpoint the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| So with what you just said, if a crime occurred on the Third Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| which runs through lots of people's backyards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| it would not necessarily say that there was a crime, an assault that happened on the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| Yes, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Because the way the officer would write the report, and I'm not trying to give you two separate answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| I'm just getting the follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| But in the narrative, what the officer would state is, is the incident occurred on the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| It would give a block range for that greenway section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| It may not be an exact latitude, longitude for that section of the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| but it would be the nearest block range as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| I want to do a process thing to move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| My hope in the way the agenda was planned is that some of these discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| these questions can move into council discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| So I do want to move this along since we want to get to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Mr. Booker and Ms. Pila both had your lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Do you feel inclined to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| I was just going to make a comment relative to what Councilman Oliver said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Imagine West Hills Park, for instance, which runs right through the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| And I would assume those addresses would relate to the private property that's adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| to the park at the spot that that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| We did have some occurrences several years ago in the park on the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| But the problem was it was adjacent to private property with children playing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3038)|
| 0:50:47| Any other questions for Mr. Catlett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Mr. Jones, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| Don Jones, Knoxville Police Department, 800 East Howard Baker Jr. Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| My division actually encompasses the training academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| and I was asked to come before you tonight to give you some information on what we do as far as training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| when it comes to weapons and use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| And I've got some things I want to go over with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| We spend at our basic academy when folks come in, 100 hours in basic firearms training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| and use of force training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Our focus on that is manipulation of the weapons, of course, marksmanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| But we spend a lot of time on mindset and conflict resolution so we don't ever have to use that weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| It's not something that we're going to use as a first resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| It would be a last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| To accomplish this, we use a classroom of approximately 25 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| to teach the seven elements of marksmanship as well as manipulation of the weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| We then spend the remainder of the time working on live fire exercises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| using approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| We also spend time working on it in our state-of-the-art use of force simulator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| which allows the officers to determine what level of use of force they should use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| in different situations that are controlled by the instructors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| So they have to make a determination whether it's deadly force or something less than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| that they're going to use in every situation in stressful situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| We are also developing, with your approval, another live firehouse to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| to do more firearms training inside buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| There will be live fire exercises that will add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| But a lot of our training, we spend probably close to 80 hours in communications training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3167)|
| 0:52:56| diversity training, conflict resolution training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| so we're able to diffuse situations and not use our weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| We don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| We also spend 80 hours in defensive tactics training and personal defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| to allow our officers to be able to defend themselves at a less than lethal level at all times if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| But even with that, sometimes we end up having to use our handgun or one of our other weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| We spend 40 hours on federal, state, and local laws to give our officers the decision-making capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| of what they're able to do in a high-stress situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| Our training is considered to be a high-stress academy because we train our folks in a stressful arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| So when they become in a stressful situation, they're going to react the way they were trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| So we spend a lot of time with the laws and the Constitution and folks' rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| and what rights that they have given by the Constitution and the laws that are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Our officers are required to pass all these courses with at least an 80 percent average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| Now, the state police officer standards and training commission only requires the police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| to receive 40 hours of firearms training and pass that course at 75 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| Ours is well above that, and they have to pass all those courses at 80 percent or better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| As far as in-service goes, I was asked to address that a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| what we do annually to train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| We have a 12-hour block in our 40-hour in-service that they're required to complete every year on use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| And even our retired officers are required to come back every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| and do an eight-hour block of in-service for use of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| That's kind of in a nutshell what our training involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| Any quick questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Do you know what's required of an ordinary citizen to get a handgun permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| I do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Tell me, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| It's an eight-hour course, and then they qualify with their weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Following up from that question, what are you actually permitted to do if you have a permit to carry a handgun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3310)|
| 0:55:19| You're permitted to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| You mean the citizens carry law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| It allows you to carry a weapon in the state of Tennessee and the other states they outlined earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| And you can legally use that weapon when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| To defend your life or somebody else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| I mean, I know that police officers go through a whole process of understanding when they can actually use their weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| And citizens are also trained when they can legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Part of their coursework is to talk about when they can legally use that weapon, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| Can a person who is permitted to carry a handgun hold it outside, hold it in their hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3356)|
| 0:56:05| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| You can just walk it around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| You can walk around with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| You can have it in your possession, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Thank you, Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| We'll go ahead into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| We have 21 people currently signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| If more people are interested in signing up, there's a sheet on the end of the table over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| Again, everybody will have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| I will hold up the yellow card when you have one minute left and the red card when your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| Our first speaker is Bill Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| I want to ask everybody to come, give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| Second speaker is actually Victor Berry, and I don't know, Mr. Berry, if you want to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| I'm assuming not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| And after that is signed up Gordon Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| So, Mr. Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| Are we going to have divided into pro-repeal or pro-keeping it in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| My name is Bill Huff, 4261 Vercelli Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| I also want to add I am the East Tennessee Zone Coordinator for the NRA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| I want to bring a few facts before you members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| You'll hear lately that the U.S. government passed a law that permit holders can carry in national parks and U.S. forests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3436)|
| 0:57:25| Well, also, throughout this whole thing, to coincide with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| the reason that they passed this park bill was because you could not carry in the national parks and U.S. forests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| if the state did not also have that on their books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| So, also, I feel that if the state representatives, as far as the House and the Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| if they feel comfortable with us having carry permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| also with the government being comfortable with us carrying in national parks and U.S. forests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| my question is, it comes before you that under our Constitution, as we the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| and taking part of the Second Amendment, that to secure a free state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3486)|
| 0:58:14| that we have the right to keep and bear arms, and that should not be infringed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Now, my question to you is, what gives you the right to take that right away from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| Because most people, all the people in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| which was so quoted over a quarter of a million people, have carry permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| Now, they have gone through, like the captain has said, they have gone through eight hours of class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| four hours on the law on when you can, when you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Then they go through a shooting course to qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| Then you go through a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| So, if you're a criminal, you are not going to get a carry permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| And this also includes spousal abuse or people with anger management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| You will not get that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Now, the question was, under our Constitutional rights in the Second Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| why do you want to take this away from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| It is our God-given right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| I see no difference of us walking around the streets, in your home, in your car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| or in a park or in a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| We're not banishing a weapon to go armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| We have this permit to protect ourselves and anybody else that happens to be in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| And you do go under training to when you can and when you cannot use that firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| So, that's the question that I'm putting before you members of council here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3581)|

| 1:00:14| Person after this is Jason Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| Good evening, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| My name is Gordon Parker, 7732 Gidcherry Lane in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| I am 62 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| I am a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| I do have a carry permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| I believe a person should always have the right to defend themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| And there, I reiterate, I appreciate our police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| our deputies, our highway patrolmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| They do a fine job, but they can't be everywhere at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| There will always be evil and there will always be mentally deranged people among us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3658)|
| 1:01:07| And I say that a gun is just a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| It is as good or as bad as the person who uses it or who carries it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| I would just like to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| This will be my last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| When the Newsom and Christian couple were brutally murdered in January of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| what if they had had a carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| and what if they had had a means to protect themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Wouldn't this situation have had a far better outcome than what it did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| when these animals killed them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Our next speaker is Jason Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| And after that, Betty Scholl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| My name is Jason Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| I live at 9917 Kaloozie Drive in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| It's obvious as you look around I'm a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| from the average demographic here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| But I hope that everybody can have a good conversation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| We all here agree on some very important things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| We all agree that we want people to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| And we all agree that we would like to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| that whatever law is in place would ensure that safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| Unfortunately, we all must also recognize the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| that laws have never truly prevented crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| This is evidenced by the fact that all laws everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| have at some point been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| From minor offenses which are injurious to no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| all the way to the most violent invasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| of our most basic rights to life and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| The men who founded this nation knew that this would be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| and that no law would stop criminal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Criminals, by definition, pay no heed to the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| that we put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| At best, we hope to protect those who abide by the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| and enact consequences for those who don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| You see, our laws do not determine right and wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| God does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Laws put in place statutes which then criminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| those who take certain actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| for which we already know to be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| For the matter at hand today, the question is then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| whether we believe that it is entirely wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| for a citizen to be prepared to defend himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| against those who would do him harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| The Founding Fathers certainly believed that it was not wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| and, in fact, they believed that it was quite necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| to make provisions which allow us to protect ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| Honest citizens, people of character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| who wouldn't dream of breaking the laws of their land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| the very people who make up the backbone of our own community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| count on their government to use the law as a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| to ensure that the odds are stacked in their favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| Right now, in our parks, we are taking a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| And it is true that changing this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| would be a chance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| But personally, I would rather take a risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| on the honest citizen than the criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| when it comes to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| The odds are right now stacked against the very people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| we should be striving to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| The law is limiting rather than promoting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| the protection of our model citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| You know, we asked, why change something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| that has worked for so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| And sure, our safety is not a huge problem right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| but we can't say that it never will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| The worst thing that you guys can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| is to be under the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| that what has been the status quo will always be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| You always have to be willing to ask yourselves why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| You have an opportunity now to stack the odds in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| of the one who strives to do good rather than harm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| and I am trusting you to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| to do the right thing and make a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| that will protect me, my family, my friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| and all of the model citizens here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| Next speaker is Betty Scholl, and after that, Joseph Burst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| Please state your name and address to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| My name is Betty Scholl, 1721 Bonita Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| I'm here on behalf of the Knox Greenways Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| which is a group of individuals who is in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| and support developing greenways in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| In July, this past July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| we unanimously approved a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| prohibiting guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| We want to state that we are completely in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| in our stance with both the Knox County Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| and Recreation Advisory Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| and the Knoxville Greenways Commission on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| We feel that if guns in parks are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| that's going to be a considerable increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| in risk for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| I'd like you to keep in mind that many of the greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| and parks are adjacent to schools and churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| Speaking on a personal note, I'm a runner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| I've been on many of the greenways in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| I feel safe on those, also in the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| I'm not there at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| The greenways and the parks are closed at dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| So again, I ask for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| in prohibiting legislation that would allow guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Our next speaker is Joseph Burst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| After that will be Paul James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4004)|

| 1:06:49| My name's Joseph Burst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| I live at 5916 Grove Park Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| First, I want to say that I am a gun holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| I have several weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| but I want to say that I do not agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| with having guns in our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| especially where we have youth sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| And as well-intended as the people with carry permits are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| and they will be the first to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| when they pull a weapon and they pull the trigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| and it discharges, that bullet can never be called back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| And if they're excellent marksmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| and they hit their target during the commission of a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| But if they hit an innocent bystander,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| that would be a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| As Mr. Skelton said, in 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| we've had very few instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| where guns in parks have been needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| It has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| And just to be quite honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| I would rather put my faith in the policemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| who've had many, many hours of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| rather than somebody that's had eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Our next speaker is Paul James,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| and after that, Harry Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| You can state your name for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| Paul James with Iams Nature Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| 2915 Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| Do you need my home address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| As the director of Iams Nature Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| I'm responsible for managing over 100 acres of city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| and next year when we expand the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| it will be double that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| I'd like to read a brief statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| on behalf of the Iams Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| Since its inception in 1965,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Iams Nature Center has been a sanctuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| for both wildlife and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Iams provides a welcoming and nurturing environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| for people of all ages to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| in environmental education programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| recreation, or solitary walks in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| Every year, Iams hosts thousands of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| through school and family-based programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| within the wildlife sanctuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| The threat of concealed or openly worn guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| contradicts the atmosphere of learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| and positive behavior that Iams promotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| To that end, all fire harms should be prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| on Iams grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| Our next speaker is Harry Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| After that will be Giles Dye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| My name is Harry Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| I live at 4521 Robindale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| I appreciate the members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| who I've emailed and talked with over the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| concerning this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| I have very, very strong feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| concerning the rights of self-defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| and personal protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| I do not feel that carrying a weapon anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| will cause someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| to all of a sudden decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| that they are going to become a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Handgun carry permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| do not have arrest powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| That's made very clear to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Handgun permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| normally do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| are involved with traffic stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| or any of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| that the police are paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| and trained very thoroughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Handgun carry permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| have permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| for one reason only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| to protect their own hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| and those of their loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Now, I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| the efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| and the success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| of the laws that we have in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| wherever they get us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| that the law enforcement officers do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| but unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| the law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| do not prevent violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| Very little violent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| occurs in the presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| of a law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| Very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Now, it may be resistance to arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| but their crimes are not perpetuated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| when there is law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| There are very few crimes that occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| There's all kind of material there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| that would be worth stealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| There's money, there's short tempers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| but most of the people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| have a very effective means of self-defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I do feel that the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| should at least consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| allowing people to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| I have never seen people openly carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| waving around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| looking for trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| I think we're just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| to be given the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| to protect ourselves if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| I don't think anybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| going to be a vigilante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| I don't carry a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I rely on other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| guiding by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I don't speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| I assume that other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| that have vehicles that will go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| 70 miles an hour will observe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| the posted speed limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| And if they don't, I hope the law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| will deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| But I do wear seat belts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| just in case for those other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Giles Dye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| After that, Liston Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| And I want to thank the council first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4337)|

| 1:12:21| up this workshop and spending their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| time to hear all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| What I'm hearing tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| is not guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| no guns, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| It's safety of individuals. It's the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| of our children, our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| and the fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| and the participation in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| activities that go on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| these parks, greenways, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| The guns are already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| in the greenways. All of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| that are there today are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| And it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| that that's the way they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| I made a decision a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| time ago personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| to defend myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| and my family and my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| and so forth by any means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| that's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| And I would respect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| individual's personal decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| to carry or to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| anything to do with a gun at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| That's a personal decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| but I would hope that that decision would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| deter or be prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| else's personal rights to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| It seems to me that I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| and this is the first time I've heard it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| mentioned tonight except the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| and that is compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| and I would hope that there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| issues here that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| be addressed by the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| and to see both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| sides of this and to see both of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| specific points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| and I really believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| that there are some valid points on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| both sides and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| certainly appreciate the consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Councilman Hall and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| efforts to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| issue taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I would think though that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| unless there are real demonstrable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| problems in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| city that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| been caused by handgun permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| carriers, holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| since the program was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| nearly 15 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| that would be one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| but this appears in a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| of cases to be looking for a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| to a non-existent problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| see any justification that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| the council would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| to allow this city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4481)|

| 1:15:19| I'm not originally from Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| but I got here as quickly as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| I grew up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| South Georgia and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| at a very young age I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| long before they allowed it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| I had a carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| and guess what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| I'm glad to report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| After I got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| studying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| laws here in Tennessee and I emailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| something about the dark history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| that we have in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I discovered that historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| white people carried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4559)|

| 1:16:03| but slave codes, black codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| and later Jim Crow laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| were used to strip African Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| from the basic means of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| self-protection. In other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| being able to carry a weapon of any sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| In recent times up until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| the mid-90s all the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| were similarly stripped of the means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| of defense unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| they were politically connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| then they could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| y'all seen them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4587)|

| 1:16:33| there were quite a few around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| some of you might ask why would you want to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| a gun? Well I've asked that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| myself too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| They can be heavy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| inconvenient. I sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| in the car and I get gouged in the ribs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| If I wear an ankle holster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| I feel like, what's his name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4613)|

| 1:16:59| you're just out of balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| there. A handgun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| is not very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| but it can be very comforting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| when things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| get bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| We do have common ground on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| we're all interested in the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| of our children. I have a granddaughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4635)|

| 1:17:19| I want to briefly mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| public shootings which is really what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| we're talking about here when we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=4643)|

| 1:32:04| I especially want children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| to feel welcome there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| I usually walk by myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| and I've never been afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| but I would be afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| if I knew that guns were allowed in the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| The natural area is filled with trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| The narrow trails that have been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| for walking and biking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5540)|

| 1:32:24| There is no way to fire a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| in that park and know where the bullet would end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| This is a haven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| a refuge and not a place for guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| You could be startled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| by a bird, a deer, a fox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| or a snake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| but you can't shoot them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| This is their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| You are the intruder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| The park and I need to be protected from guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| not by guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| No compromise, no guns in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5568)|

| 1:32:58| You have three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| My name is Garrett Cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| I live at 3200 Kingsmore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| First thing I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| to point out and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| most of us can agree with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| is that permit holders are not the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| It is criminals who are the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| No wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| can ever prevent anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| from carrying a gun into a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| if they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| It's just really not going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| It's not practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Unfortunately we don't have a genuine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| sanctuary in the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| There's nothing to prevent inflow and outflow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Only people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| presently being disarmed are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| law-abiding, responsible citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| Really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| I've got my notes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| I'm glad that the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| are well trained and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| able to respond as needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| but unfortunately they can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| everywhere all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| It's a big problem. We all can't walk around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| with a police officer bodyguard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| everywhere we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| anti-repeal crowd here has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| throwing out concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| guns in sporting events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| ball fields, things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| Personally I do feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| like some of those arguments do have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| merit. I'd much rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| have the ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| to be repealed in at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| some areas, meaning greenways and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| non-sporting events type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| areas rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| not at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I believe the question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| you really have to ask yourself is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| if you're in one of our parks with your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| and someone is there with the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| to kidnap one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| are you going to be glad at that moment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| a benevolent citizen is nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| with a tool that is capable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| of defending you and them against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| that person or are you going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| to cry out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| helplessly as they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| whatever they do with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| I know how I would answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| and I'd invite you all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| dwell on that as well. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5701)|

| 1:35:11| Mr. Vice Mayor, do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| have people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| at a certain time to speak or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| the list just wide open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| and we just continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| as long as people come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| That is the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| I'm Tom Badgett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5725)|

| 1:35:33| These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| difficult times and we hear a lot of publicity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| about violence of all kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Statistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| I have read nationally that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| deterrent to crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| just the knowledge or presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| of a firearm without it ever being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| someone mentioned a gun free zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| gun free zones to me are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| an invitation to criminals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| I'm a Tennessee certified firearms instructor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| and in that capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| I work with private citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| hundreds of them who are applying for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| their Tennessee carry permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| and I'll have to say that in my experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| these are law abiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| honest, friendly, courteous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| helpful, kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| citizens who obey the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| who simply want to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| their right to defend themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| and to defend their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| that's evidenced I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| by the fact that they apply for the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| they make public the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| they are obeying the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| part of their application requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| a background check as has already been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| so if there's any criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| activity in their background it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| caught and they will not be allowed to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| a gun under a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| I'll have to say if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5803)|

| 1:36:47| and is not repealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| it's my belief that these hundreds of permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5809)|

| 1:36:55| probably 400 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5815)|

| 1:37:03| permits will obey the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| they will not carry guns in the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| if this law stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| the law stands the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| criminals then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| will be able to carry guns because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| obey the signs, they don't obey the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| on the other hand if this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| in it's wisdom would repeal the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| and permit trained permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| carriers to carry in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| then at least you give them equal rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| with criminals and I think that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5851)|

| 1:37:55| right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5875)|

| 1:38:13| the same, guns will still not be allowed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5893)|

| 1:38:17| make permit holders the exception to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| rule and that's all we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| most of this stuff has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| covered already tonight but permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| are the most law abiding citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| and statistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| even have a better record than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| law enforcement and we know how good of a record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| law enforcement has, they're really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| you feel comfortable with law enforcement carrying in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| parks, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| permit holders, who approves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| permit holders? Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| law enforcement does when they go through the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| check, the county sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| has to sign off of them, it goes to the TBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| and FBI computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| all that stuff is covered through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| so if you're comfortable with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| law enforcement officer carrying a gun in the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| that's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| the same approval that a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| holder has had. Now a permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| by no means is law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| because it is a civilian handgun permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| and that's all it is. It is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| self-defense and they're all trained in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| classes that the only time that gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| ever comes out of the holster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| is if you're in imminent fear of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| serious bodily injury or death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| at that moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| and permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| holders also know that a punch in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| nose is not serious bodily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| injury because the courts in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| have upheld that a broken nose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| is not serious bodily injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| if a permit holder ever pulls his gun out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| it's not because he just got yelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| at, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5983)|

| 1:39:47| but just for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5989)|

| 1:39:53| they don't have a permit program at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| if you can buy a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| legally in Vermont| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| you can carry a gun anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| in Vermont except in federal buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| and places like that but they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| little league fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| it doesn't matter, they can carry there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| our permit program is a lot more stricter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| than that because we do have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| all the other checks, we have to take the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| and things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| so the argument of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| you know, somebody pulling a gun out in the bleachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| and shooting an umpire because they made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| bad call, it won't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6023)|

| 1:49:41| that made a decision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| our governor agrees with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| the mayor of New York City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| I was born and bred and raised there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6587)|

| 1:49:51| several centuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6591)|

| 1:49:57| gun free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| The reason New York State is gun free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| is similar to why Tennessee was gun free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| for blacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| because a bunch of people decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| that they wanted to keep the next round of immigrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| from having guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| That's what they decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| so they passed the Sullivan Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| and we've been living the ramifications of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6617)|
| 1:50:19| I got a gun several years ago because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| outside of my computer work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| I wanted a hobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| It was something I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| I got a permit to go to the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| because my wife wanted me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| and I thought about getting the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| After I took that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| I waited three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| because what I learned in the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| made me think about it for a lot longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| because I'm responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| for every round I fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6643)|

| 1:50:47| I'm personally liable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6647)|

| 1:51:51| I don't carry anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| I've been back in the park since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| but I haven't carried my gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| because it's against the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| I don't know if any of you have ever been in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| where you felt your life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| was in danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| I have been in the point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| you did not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| whether you were going to make it out or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| and that was a point where I didn't carry a weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| fortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| and it was in this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| it was when I lived here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| and it wasn't because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| I was out where I shouldn't have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| I was just going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| What I'm asking is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| when I go to a park with my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| give me the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| to keep my children safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| I'm not asking for the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| to defend Mr. Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| or anybody else who doesn't want me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Let me defend my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6761)|

| 1:52:59| Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6779)|

| 1:53:07| We all remember learning that phrase in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| It sounds nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| but what does it really mean to have the right to life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| and what good is my right to life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| if I'm not able to enforce that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| Does it mean that someone who takes my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| will be punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| or does it mean that I have the right to defend myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| If my life is ever taken from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| it will do little good to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| to know that the perpetrator has been put in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| So I hope it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| that I have the right to defend myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| As a martial arts instructor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| I've spent a lot of time thinking about and writing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| self-defense and self-preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| In doing so I've come to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| that self-defense is the most basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| private, important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| and fundamental human right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| best prepared will survive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| After years of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| there are still limitations however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| to what can be done against an armed attacker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| by an unarmed attacker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| or by an unarmed defender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| Therefore I would advise anyone serious about self-defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| to train and carry a firearm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| Some think that we should get rid of guns altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Sadly this reminds me of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| quote end all WMD sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| that I see outside of Y-12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| in Oak Ridge, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| That fantasy seems nice but they've forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| that guns are the reason we have all the freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| we have today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| They still see these types of meetings as a way to feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| they are making themselves safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| They couldn't be more wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Creating these so-called gun-free zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| only keeps law abiders from possessing guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| and makes a criminal's job easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| No $50 fine is going to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| Some think that I don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| to carry a weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| or self-defense in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| because they are safe enough for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| The fact that people believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| is a sign that they are the perfect victim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| It's also nice that they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| the parks are safe enough for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| but shouldn't a decision on whether or not a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| is quote safe enough for me be my decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| not theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| I've been told that I have a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| not to go to the park if I don't think it's safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Do I have the same choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| not to pay the tax money that goes to pay for that park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Some think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| that we should rely on law enforcement alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| but law enforcement as a deterrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| has its limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| There are still those criminals who do not care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| about the consequences of their actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| The Knoxville PD and Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| do a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Unfortunately, it is impossible to staff enough police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| to prevent every crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| The news headlines are enough of a reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| that there are violent, sick people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| who wouldn't think twice before harming you, me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| or our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| It is currently and has been for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| illegal for someone in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| to be in possession of a concealed firearm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| without a Tennessee handgun carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| This resolution would not change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| What this resolution would change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| is whether or not a handgun carry permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| may carry their weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| into public Knoxville parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| Those without a permit who carry a weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| are already breaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| a stronger criminal law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| Now, I can't speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| for every carry permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| but I'm sure I speak for most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| I obtained my Tennessee handgun carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| so that I could follow the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| If I didn't intend to follow the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| I would not have bothered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| with the lengthy and costly training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| and the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| During my training, I learned the Tennessee laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| regarding the use of deadly force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Tennessee residents are only allowed to use deadly force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| when there is an imminent danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| of death or serious bodily injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| If you think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=6987)|
