| 0:02:16| At this point in the meeting, we have one item on the agenda, and I'd like to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| and the way this works, especially for our folks who have something before us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| you come forward, the law director is going to swear everybody in, you're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| asked some questions about your application, and then as long as our important parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| say that it's clear, then it'll pass, and we'll wish you luck on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=158)|

| 0:06:34| The application states 7106 Grizzly Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| They've messed that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| They may have messed that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| So to be clear, for the purpose of the clerk's records and for the record of this meeting, it's Grizzly Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| Good catch, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=406)|

| 0:07:21| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Good evening and welcome to the September meeting of the Knox County Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| Before we jump into the meeting, I want to just start, especially for some of you, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| may be your first county commission meeting or you may be watching the meeting from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| The purpose of this meeting is to have our formal votes and additional discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| the items that we need to rule on this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| Last week, we had a county commission work session and during that work session, we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| the first pass through on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| As a result of that work session, you'll find and you'll notice that we have part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| agenda of items for our schools as well as some of the general items that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| vote on have been lumped together in what we call our consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| So, you'll find during this meeting, there's going to be a couple of times where if you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| never been here before, it's kind of confusing, where I'm going to ask the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| to read a whole litany of items into the record and then we will vote on all of those with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| So, in spite of me taking the minute to explain this, it really does save us a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| when we manage the meetings like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Additionally, after the Board of Commissioners meeting is over at 7 p.m., we will move into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| our zoning meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| My hope is that we can get through all of our commission agenda and we will not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| to come back to it after the zoning meeting is because as my fellow commissioners will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| know, we've got a lot on our packet for tonight's zoning materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| So, with that said, I'll ask the clerk's office to call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=532)|

| 0:14:31| Is that something you'd prefer to wait until the zoning meeting, or if you'd like to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| of tee it up right now, I can give you a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=874)|

| 0:14:39| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| I also, I know Tom Spangler had mentioned he may, when I spoke to him a few days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| may have wanted to speak after last night's, at the meeting, the work session when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=889)|

| 0:15:00| I know he's wrapped up with something right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Do you know if he's going to be here tonight and might want to, yeah, just check with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| and then let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=905)|

| 0:15:11| he had some extra data that he just wanted to briefly share with the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| So, if he still wants to do that, just let me know and we can work him in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| And then, finally, I know Mayor Jacobs wanted to address the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| So, Mayor Jacobs, if you wanted to address the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor, 400 Main Street, Suite 16, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| On July 1st of this year, Tom McFarlane, an attorney in Rome County, sent a cease and desist letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| to Chairman Nystrom, Chris Caldwell, in his capacity as Chairman of the Knox County Retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| and Pension Board, and me, demanding the county, in his words, cease misuse of taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| and illegal disbursement of taxpayer dollars by payment of UOP lifetime benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| in excess of that approved by the taxpayers slash voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| On July 9th, John Owings, General Counsel for the Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| responded to Mr. Farlane's demand letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| I would like to read Mr. Owings' letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Dear Mr. McFarlane, I am in receipt of your letter dated July 1st, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| demanding the secession of benefit payments under the Knox County Uniformed Officers' Pension Plan, UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| As you may know, this issue has been thoroughly contested and litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| The Knox County Law Director, on his own, as well as through attorneys from multiple law firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| arguing on behalf of Knox County taxpayers and voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| litigated the method of retirement benefit calculations for UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| For more than a year, multiple lawsuits filed in both Knox County Circuit and Chancery Courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| were litigated against the Pension Board, as well as a certified class of retired and active officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| surviving beneficiaries, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| I have attached, for your review, the complaint in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| versus Knox County Retirement and Pension Board, et al.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Knox County Chancery Court, docket number 195629-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| The attached complaint represents just one of those filed in six separate matters on this very issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| As you can see from the complaint, as well as all other pleadings filed across the multiple matters litigating this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| counsel signs each and every pleading as the representative of both Knox County and its taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| Emphasis added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| He includes other matters as well, but I will skip those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| After significant effort, time, and expense, the county settled all pending suits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| paid the officers' attorney fees and court costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| and agreed to a specific amendment to UOP eliminating the number of days of vacation cash-out considered pensionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| The Knox County Mayor initiated the settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| and the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board and the Knox County Commission both voted to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| The settlement was then reviewed by the Knox County Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| to make sure the interests of the certified classes were protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| and ultimately all pending matters on this issue were dismissed with prejudice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| As such, all matters related to the issues cited in your demand letter have been litigated to finality by the taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| and cannot be pursued further by the same parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| To bring another suit over the same matter by the same parties would be a violation of Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure 1102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| A copy of the court's agreed order approving settlement and closing case in docket number 195629-1 is attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| Further, for your edification, in 2012, Knox County voters adopted a charter amendment closing UOP enrollment to new officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:57| but allowing UOP to remain in effect for any officers who participated prior to January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| By voting the 2012 amendment to the Knox County Charter, the voters of Knox County adopted and ratified the UOP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| as it had been previously interpreted for the officers enrolled prior to July 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| Based on the fact that the UOP and its method of administration are codified in the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| and the fact that the issues presented in your demand letter have already been litigated on behalf of the Knox County taxpayers to finality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| there is no authority for the Pension Board to change its computation of vested and accrued UOP benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| and therefore no basis for cessation of its current administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| To do so would violate the due process rights of UOP participants and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Given due consideration to the information contained herein and attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| and in light of Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure 1102, please conduct yourself accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| Mr. Farland has not responded to Mr. Owen's letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| On Friday, my officers received the following summons and complaint from Mr. McFarland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| filed in Knox County Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1211)|

| 0:20:22| Lloyd Pfeffer, Melissa Pfeffer, Jacob Cullen Thurber, Zachary Peter Thurber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| on behalf of themselves and the citizens and taxpayers of Knox County versus Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| Please note, the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board is not named as a defendant in this suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| You should have received copies of Mr. McFarland's cease and desist demand letter to the Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| Mr. Owen's response letter, and Mr. McFarland's Chancery Court filing against Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Today, the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board authorized its counsel to intervene in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| Because the law director's office has taken a stance on the UOP issue that is counter to that of my office and commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| and is conflicted in this matter, having acted as the plaintiff in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| versus Knox County Retirement and Pension Board at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| I am requesting that commission authorize my office to retain outside counsel to represent Knox County in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Are there any questions for Mayor Jacobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| Mayor Jacobs, I'll take that as a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| Well, that is a request, and it's come in right before we set our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| so the timing on that we can allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| We'll close your public forum, and then we'll move to the next item, which will be setting our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| and we can add that in as an agenda item to follow through on your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1308)|

| 0:22:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Madam Clerk, next item is amendments to and setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| Seeing no lights, I'll review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Most of these items were reviewed during the forum, and we've gone over, but just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| we've got items 41, 44, and 45 are additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:24| Deferrals are item 28, 29, and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| The non-consent items are items 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 22, 36, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:56| I'll also add that as item 39 is directly related to item 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| it's my intention to move item 39 to the top of the agenda so that we can take care of that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| at the same time that we take care of item number 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| So, other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| This is a procedural question because I'm not sure if I understand the request the Mayor has just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:30| It's my understanding he's probably asked us to authorize, or I don't know the exact verbiage would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| but probably to pass a resolution that authorizes him to hire an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| probably something our outside counsel for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| So, procedurally, it means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Someone would need to probably make a request to add that to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| And then we would vote on that when we set our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| And then when we get to it, we'll have discussion and vote on it like any other item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| So, we don't actually have to have the language right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| We're just simply indicating when we get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| This is still part of setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Could we hear the honorary resolutions first before we do any kind of other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Yeah, that's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| But I do want to get the agenda set briefly before we do that, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Any other lights over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Were there any other additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| So, I will, based on what the Mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| I mean, I can make a motion that we will add the Mayor Jacobs item to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| So, that's what your clarification was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| So, we will add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| And we will move that to happen maybe between J and K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| That will have to be separately voted on and two-third vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| So, to be added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| So, we need to have a quick vote to have that added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Do you need a second for the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| So, we have a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| For the record, Commissioner Gill, would you like to be the one who made that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Or were you just asking a clarifying question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| You know, I can make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| I just wanted to know if that was the procedural thing that I was understanding that we needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| So, we can have that discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| So, you've made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| So, all in favor of adding this one to the agenda say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| Or do we need to do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| That would be two-thirds roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Two-thirds roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| And is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Is that because it just had to clarify Mr. Lauder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| We just need to get that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Then you can take your vote on the merits when we get to it on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| So, this is just to make this added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| Before we take the vote, so we know how to vote, the purpose of hiring this lawyer is for what purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:13| Well, I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Before we go down this path of discussing it, I might go back to what Commissioner Schoonmaker had suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| We've got two folks, two recognition-related items that I would like to maybe get through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| before we begin to discuss the merits of adding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| So, as Chair, what I'll do, I'm going to move setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| I'll move that to after we've had the two honorary resolutions just to get those done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| and then we can go ahead and engage in that discussion if you all would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| So, with that said, Madam Clerk, would you please call item Honorary Resolution 1, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| We're not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| I just want to get through the honoraries, and then we can come back to setting the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| So, go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Honorary Resolution 1 for Mr. Stephens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Knox County Public Defender Mark Stephens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| This is Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| We have a motion for approval by Commissioner Gill and a second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Next item, I'd like to go ahead and also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| You're going to read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Well, let's do item 39 as well because they're both related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| So, can I have a motion for approval, Commissioner Gill on item 39?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| I'll do it if I come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| I have a motion from Commissioner Carringer and a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| All in favor of item 39, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Items 1 and 39, the resolution and item 39 have both passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Would y'all like to stand with me as we read the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Because we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Good evening, my fellow commissioners in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| We're going to read a resolution into the record honoring a very committed servant leader in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:19| Whereas, Knox County Public Defender Mark Stevens is retiring effective October 31, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| after over 29 years of service as Knox County's first and only elected public defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| And whereas, Mark Stevens was first elected to serve as the public defender for the 6th Judicial District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:40| and sworn in on September 1, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| And thereafter, Mr. Stevens was re-elected for three consecutive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| And whereas, Mark Stevens administered his office from 1990 until 2003 under a traditional representation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:58| However, after recognizing that poverty, homelessness, mental illness, addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| and lack of support systems create barriers to client self-sufficiency and successful community reintegration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:14| Mr. Stevens' vision for his clients in the criminal justice system led to a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| and more comprehensive representation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| And whereas, under Mark Stevens' leadership, a holistic, client-centered representation model was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:31| at the Knox County Public Defender's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| And with this evolution, the office became the Knox County Public Defender's Community Law Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=1774)|

| 0:34:09| It's a benchmark for the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| And I know, speaking at least for myself, it's a pleasure to be able to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2051)|

| 0:35:05| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Just before the clerk starts, I did want to mention that Bruce had no idea that this award was coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| His employees got together, submitted the application, followed the process through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| and at the last minute, he shows up at a conference and in front of 800 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| he walks out there and they present this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| So I'll let the clerk go ahead and read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Whereas Bruce Stiles, General Manager of the First Utility District of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| recently received the Diversity Award for the State of Tennessee from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2137)|

| 0:35:50| structure, and continued success of any organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2150)|

| 0:36:23| and since that time he has worked tirelessly to implement a diversity program at First Utility District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| to make it an organization where any individual willing to contribute to the team mentality can strive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| grow, and provide opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2196)|

| 0:37:03| for First Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2223)|

| 0:37:14| has implemented crucial problematic elements for their Bruce himself models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| and leads them in the value of diversity and the way he manages and lives his life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| far more than a policy or program could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| And whereas in addition to the Diversity Award, First Utility District has received in both 2018 and 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:40| the Knoxville Top Workplace Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2260)|

| 0:37:57| when we have a diversity of ideas, experiences, and heritage represented and respected in our workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2277)|

| 0:40:22| You expect to run things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| So we built a team, which you all have heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| And so, effective in 2025, we'll be completely debt-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| We had $77 million in debt eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| We will have zero debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| We are at the same time implementing a lot of business practices that will continue to improve our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| and our experience for our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| And as part of that process, we were reevaluated by Standard & Poor's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| and we're the only wastewater system in the state of Tennessee now to have a AAA bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| So that speaks to my company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| And, of course, he's done this by, you know, having the right people in the right places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| Also, I think it's interesting that Julie Blaylock is here with the Farragut-West Knox Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| She wanted to be here in the audience to partake of this dedication to Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| John, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Stan, stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Sorry, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| And I just wanted to leave you with this, which is First Utility District's motto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| which I think we all can learn from, and it's where community comes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2496)|

| 0:41:49| The chair would like to take just a moment to recognize Stan Johnson and all the students from SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| Stan, would you like to come to the podium for just a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| I hate to put you on the spot, but you've got a great group of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| You all smartly skipped the beer board meeting at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| And if you could give us just a, tell us a little bit about your group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2524)|

| 0:42:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Treasurer, come to, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| My name is Stan Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I live at 2805 Woodbine Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| I represent a group called SEED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| It stands for Socially Equal Energy Efficient Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| We train inner city youth on green technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Today we're with our career readiness class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| This is our program coordinator, Treasurer Hightower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| If you could tell them about the program, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| What we have is an eight-week pay training program that teaches life, job, and placement skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| to young adults ages 18 to 24, mostly in inner cities, with a focus on green technologies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| So if anybody needs some work, we have some young people that will be ready in about three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| to get some jobs out here in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Nothing stops a bullet like a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| so we just really want to get these young people out in the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| and start really getting them into affordable housing and jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| and making sure that they're the ones solving the problems instead of ones creating the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| So thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Stan, not to put anybody on the spot, but why don't you go get Bruce's business card over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| If you're talking about environmental energy, Bruce is doing a good job with a whole lot of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Well, let's do it, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| So that might be a good networking opportunity to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| I want to thank the mayor for letting us come up in the office earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| taking the camera shots and pictures and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2606)|

| 0:43:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Madam Clerk, I think that gets us through that first part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| What I'm going to do is I'm going to revisit item number D, which is our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| I'm going to review where we were and then we can discuss the ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| For tonight's agenda, we have items 41, 44, and 45, which are to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| Items to be deferred, items 28, 29, and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| The non-consent agenda is items number 1, 2, 4, 21, 22, 36, 37, 39, which we've already covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:43| 42, 43, 44, 45, and 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| Additionally, Mayor Jacobs has come to us and has requested to hire an attorney to represent the county in this lawsuit matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2691)|
| 0:45:00| which would be needed to be added to our agenda because it just came to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| That item, when added, I would propose that we discuss it early in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| probably between items J and K, which would be at the very beginning of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:24| That is the agenda that I present to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| All in favor of setting the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Commissioner Jay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| There was a motion and a second to add Mayor Jacobs' item, and I believe there's a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| That's probably where we're standing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you for reminding me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Okay, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| We're doing the roll call vote and starting with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Point of clarification, this is to simply add it to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| This is not to vote on the merits or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| This is just to add it so that we can just discuss it a little later in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Mr. Gill has stepped out of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I think it would be important for her to be here for this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Somebody could go find her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:27| We can do that after school, so I just kind of want to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| All right, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:41| Let's have the vote just to set the whole agenda with this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:57| We can propose this as part of the agenda and then they can vote and just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| Mr. Chair, let's go ahead with the vote and come back to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Well, I'm going to give her about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2828)|
| 0:47:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2853)|

| 0:47:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2862)|

| 0:48:05| Thank you all for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| If it had been you on the other side, it's important to make sure everybody gets a stake in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Can we not just skip Commissioner Gill and come back to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2903)|

| 0:49:59| at another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=2999)|

| 0:50:02| You need two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3002)|

| 0:50:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| I had a teleconference going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Anyway, I won't take but about a couple of minutes, just real quick, what I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| talk to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Last week, whenever you all were discussing the jail assessment, what have you, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| wanted to add and say that I appreciate the attention on this issue, that I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| the Mayor's Office putting this review together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Obviously, it's just the beginning of what we have down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| I think all of you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| What I did want to say was that the Sheriff's Office has prioritized the expansion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| pretrial release and increased the number of low-level violators that qualify for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| county's pretrial release program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| And those of you, you've heard about all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| As of today, since January, we are right at 1,100 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| So, it kind of gives you an idea of what we are doing within the Sheriff's Office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| within the corrections side of trying to get those people in and out quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| It's not that we're hanging on to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| We are trying to get them out as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Our jail count today, as of today, was 1,582.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| We're a little over 250 over right now for what our capacity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| So, again, it kind of gives you an idea of what we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| We do have several state inmates that we are still working on with the state to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| come and get their inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| All of you all understand the Carver lawsuit that we are under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| And that Carver lawsuit does say that the state has to come and pick up those inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| that are in state custody once they are adjudicated within the judicial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| They have 14 days to come get those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| And we still have a large number of those right now that we're still waiting on them to come get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| So, I think we're going to make one more attempt with that before we have to take another step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| with that that may not be the most popular thing to have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| but it may be the most necessary step for us to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| What I do want to add real quick and say that I want to compliment our sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| jail personnel, administration for dealing with what they have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| and the circumstances to keep this jail a constitutional jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| It's very important that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| And it's very important to this commission to know that that's what we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| and we will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| And those men and women have worked very diligently under those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| And I want to commend them and say thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| I want to also say thank you to this commission for your attention to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Stick around just a moment, Sheriff, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| I know that I saw Commissioner Jay had a slide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3178)|

| 1:01:38| But that's reading them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| If we're trying to get the school people out here, are we going to move Commissioner Jay's discussion item for the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| That's actually one of the items I'd like to go ahead and we'll move on to that one, then we'll go ahead and move up to the mayor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Okay, now we have that motion is properly before us for the school consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3722)|

| 1:02:09| Next item, just to knock out it so we can finish the school-related agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| was a discussion regarding the potential move of Knox County Schools brought to us by Commissioner Jay at last week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:23| Commissioner Jay, I know you brought that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Would you like, I'll go ahead and recognize you if this is a good spot to go ahead and bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| I know that also it's come to my attention, and correct me if I'm wrong, Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| does the school team have a retreat this weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Is that a planning retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| Is it this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| This Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| This Friday, is it going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| All right, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| I just reiterate my comments from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| I hope everybody took a little bit of time to go tour the AJ building and tour the TVA Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| I hope my fellow commissioners took a minute to both review the information that was presented by our leading experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3778)|
| 1:03:08| everything from Chris Caldwell in the finance department to our school systems to our partners in development and in our PVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:18| and then also the information that I compiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| I think it's just an opportunity to open the conversation again and have anybody ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| We have everybody here tonight, and if anybody has additional questions, it would be a good time to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| In summary of everything that I've looked at, we have an opportunity as commission to save between $29 and $70 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:41| which is two to three more schools that we could build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| There's a clear economic advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| It's a clear opportunity to improve the working conditions of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| and to improve the economic conditions of our community, and I hope everybody will take this very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| and look at the data, look at the numbers, and look at the opportunity ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| Change is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Nobody likes change, but change is inevitable, and opportunities like this don't come along every commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:16| So I'd just like to open the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| I may chime back in, but right now I just thought it would be a good opportunity to talk about it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Go ahead, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| My tour is tomorrow, so I'm looking forward to taking the tour with Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| It seems like some of the questions surrounding is the contract itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| and I'd like to ask the law department if they're able to speak at this point in time about the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| I would like to see the contract if it's possible, and I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| I didn't sleep at the Holiday Inn, but I still would like to look over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3891)|
| 1:05:00| Well, there will be more than one contract item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| This is a very complex procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| We're talking about more than one piece of real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| It's still currently under negotiations, even as we speak this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| I know that several of the attorneys were still amending and shifting things, so it's still a work in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| so it's hard for me to really comment on something that we don't have in a finality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| So I would rather wait until we have something that we can comment on for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| All these other things are kind of policy and whatever you all think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| At this point in time, we don't have a final contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| and I really don't have much to say about it because it could be completely different in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| And I'd rather wait until we have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| And like I say, there will be several different contracts associated with this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| If you go with the TVA towers, it's going to be a multifaceted agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| And, you know, a piece on one comes in and a piece on another one comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| We're trying to get them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| The mayor has tried to ask us to have something finalized by the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| And we're doing our best to get all that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| So hopefully after that we'll have something that you can look at and talk about and vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Does that answer your question for now, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I kind of wanted to ask the law director a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| I mean, the one thing about Knox County Commission is we fund the money to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:38| but yet we do not have any say-so in how they spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| So, and their school board people are separately elected just like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| So is it legal for us to somewhat push the school people out of our building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4012)|
| 1:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| I don't think that's the resolution that's stuck before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| The school board, my understanding is, is that, you know, the county is working on a deal for an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:22| The school board still has to vote to either move or not to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| They have custody and control of the building they're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| and that's usually controlled by day-to-day operations by the director of schools, by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| It's controlled by the school board, by policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| And once all these things are done, I mean, the mayor is working with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| The school board is working with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| They're working on a deal with the TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| We're trying to work on the contracts from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| And once it all comes together, I would hope that maybe the school board has already acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| You all have something to act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| It's just a matter of, you know, what comes when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| So, yes, you can vote on a contract, and the school board can vote on the surplus of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| the acceptance of the buildings, and then you all will vote to do what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| I mean, it's a procedural thing, but it all kind of has to flow in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| This is not a one telling another, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Yeah, so, I mean, we could have a situation where, I'm just putting it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| and we've gone this long in working on it, and say our school board voted it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| and we voted for them to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| I mean, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| You're voting to approve a contract with a potential, I don't know what the term is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:46| they call it an easement, but to make it vernacular, we're wanting to rent a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| We're wanting to rent it on behalf of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| You can vote with the intent to rent the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| It will always be subject to the surplus, the A.J. building, the vote of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| It's kind of like when we would build a school, the county would build a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| It's subject to the school board's approval to take that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| So, you can do and say here's our intent, and everybody has to work together on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| and it's like your appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| You can appropriate, and they use the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| It's a complex negotiation between both sides of the aisle, if you will, and both sides of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| Commissioner Carringer, is that good to clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Okay, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| Mr. Thomas, since you're still here, can I ask you a couple of questions, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools, 901 or 912 South K Street, A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| As the chief executive officer of the schools, which you're appointed to right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| you bring recommendations to your board, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| And so, you look at things, and then you decide what is best for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| and then you present that, correct, again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Now, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| How many commissioners up here has come to you and asked what the school system needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| The only time I've been asked by a commissioner anything was when Commissioner Daley asked me something a couple of weeks ago about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| And so, we're doing a recommendation up here, and we haven't even asked what the school board really needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| Let me ask you one other thing here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| Since it's your recommendation that will go to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| what would be your process in looking at some of these properties that were listed, you know, these recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| Have you seen that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| There is a difference between what Commissioner Jay did and what I've got from Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| and they have some different items on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Have you discussed those with any other commissioners about which one would be the best for the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| What would be the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| What would be the optimum thing for schools to establish a new location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:43| And I think it's like I said the other day, if you're speaking ideally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| Ideally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Ideally, the school district school system would be located, you know, on one site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| Easy access to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Public parking would be hopefully at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| And all of the employees could be, all the non-school employees could be housed on a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| We've talked about for several years, you know, maintenance and also the Sarah Simpson Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| and the central office could be located on one site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| That would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| So you've got about six locations you would consolidate and put on one location, which would be optimal for you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:29| Would be optimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Has anybody suggested any or looked at anything and given you ideas of where that could be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| or is it just, you know, nobody's asked you anything at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| Well, several years ago, I think maybe about four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| I believe the county and then Mr. Caldwell had to correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| asked Barbara McMurray, I think, to look at the rural site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| And that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| It would take a couple of different proposals, one being if the central office was just on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| then the other proposal, I think, or drawings would indicate like maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| and we would move out of the East Fifth Avenue buildings on there for maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| and then also East Fork where we've got some storage, also the Sarah Simpson Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| All those would be consolidated into one on one site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| And so I think the cost maybe, I don't know what the cost of that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| but I think the conversation at the time was the cost, it would be pretty expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| so I'm not sure if there was anything else done with it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| But if you did consolidate and put the A.J. building in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| is there five or six other out parcels that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| Again, that would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| I mean, but do you have five other out parcels plus the A.J. building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| Roughly, I think maybe a couple of buildings out of maintenance, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| So we could put five additional pieces of property back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| if we did it and consolidated everything on one site, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| And we'd have to look at those sites to see how much tax dollars they'd bring in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| But we haven't done that, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Not to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| We don't know what the cost would be or if it was equitable to do that with those six properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| Yes, unless Mr. Caldwell maybe has some numbers on the real site to do all of that, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| I've not seen a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| But that's been, what, 2015 when they did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| About four years ago, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| So we just still haven't really sat down and asked what you all's needs were at the schools, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| So we just don't know what to vote for, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| But anyway, that's just my conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Yes, Mr. Thomas, when did we start discussing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| When did Mayor Burchett approach you about selling the A.J. building and talk about moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| The fall, I believe it was, of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| So last week you told us this was the first you had heard or nobody had asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Have you not expressed your concerns at all in any of those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| I mean, you did an interview on TV about looking forward to the process and the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| Have you not asserted yourself at all in those conversations, or is this something totally new to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| Let me just say, back to that press conference, yes, I'm not opposed to selling the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:40| I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| But I think if you go back and look at it and listen to it, I said possibly a location with two to three floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| and access parking and ease of access, I guess, too, which in my mind neither is provided at TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:56| So, you know, my standpoint is if it doesn't better us, then, you know, why do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4556)|
| 1:16:04| How does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| You have six floors, Class A office space with a parking garage accessible to anybody and everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| I mean, I'd like to see a bridge built across there, but that is, you know, you said last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:23| that we could stay in the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| To put $40 million in the A.J. building that has none of what you just talked about, why would we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| Well, that TVA building doesn't have it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| And, again, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| I talked with the mayor Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Recently it's Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| I have some questions on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Mr. McPherson and Mr. Caldwell are going to meet tomorrow, talk about those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| You know, just for example, the cost of the Andrew Johnson building and looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| it was increased 5% a year for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| It's not ever increased 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| But the renovations alone would increase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Well, I don't know what the renovation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| No one has told me other than the fact that it's 125,000 square feet in that building times $125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| It's $15.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| So I don't know what those renovations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| Last week when you asserted that if you haven't asserted yourself in that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| and we're getting almost to the point where we're about to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| that kind of alarms me that you made it sound like they're hiding something from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| when you were in the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| No, I have never been asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Superintendent, what is your concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| What do you feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| What do you think is best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| I've never been asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| It's always been talked down to me like, okay, here's the move and we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| Mr. Thomas, I think the concept of getting everybody on one space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| was reviewed at rural high school, that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| In order to get maintenance, everything there, there would have to be a parking garage built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| I think the total of that was like $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| You're not advocating for the school going $40 million in debt, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| No, but I was asked what would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| I do realize on the way this deal is structured that there would be no debt taken on by the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| for any of the renovations to the TVA tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| Again, no one has explained anything to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| It was in all the stuff, documents that we all got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| We can get you a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Now, I saw the presentation, but I haven't seen the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Is the lease locked in for 40 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| If it goes up, is TVA going to or is the county going to eat the overage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| There's escalators built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| It can only go up so much each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| You had shown me a list, that $25 million that the school system has put into the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:05| In that list, there was O&M, operation and maintenance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| It was the debt and interest and space cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Whatever is in the space cost was in that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Space cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Rent, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| Chris, is space cost rent or is it operation and maintenance for utilities and keeping the building running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| O&M would be utilities, security, janitorial, things like that, so your general O&M, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4769)|
| 1:19:40| They're basically sunk costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| You can never expect to get those things back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| We used to charge them out of space cost, and then we brought it back as just one lump sum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| because people thought space cost meant why are we paying rent on a building that we don't own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| so we changed how we started accounting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| But to think about it, it's more O&M than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Did we ever get a breakdown of what debt service the school system was paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| whether it was for the A.J. building alone or whether it was for the Dwight Kessel garage or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| The bond was issued jointly as A.J. and Kessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| We're digging in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| It's hard to get information from 30 years ago, but we're trying to figure out what portion was paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| It looks, if you go back and look at CAFRs from back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| it looks like there was a portion that was paid by the county and a portion paid by schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| What that would infer to me, just by looking at those schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| is the county probably picked up the piece for Kessel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| and schools picked up the piece for the A.J. building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| and we may have deviated a percentage because I think historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| and he probably knows more than this than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| but probably historically they've had about 80% of the A.J. buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| So we picked up a percentage of that and just split out the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| which we do currently on all bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| We split it by the prorated amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| You say A.J. Do you also mean Dwight Kessel or is that totally separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| I think Kessel was in the same bond issue as A.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| So I think it was one bond and we just split that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| Did we ever find out what the school system was paying for space in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| before they moved to the A.J. building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| I've never saw a number like that, and that predates Ron probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| I'll call Ann Acuff and see if her memory can think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| but I think that's historically a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Do we know what the current cost per square foot in space in this building is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| For O&M?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| I'm going to estimate six to eight, but I don't know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| I have a question for Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| So because I was in the press release a couple years ago when we were in the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| I made that announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Is it correct to say, or if my memory serves me correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| you didn't want another vertical format as well for an administrative function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Again, that would be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| That would be ideal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Is the topic of the school system move on the agenda for the retreat that's coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:38| I mean, I saw your retreat, but it's not to say that it can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| The agenda can't be built in to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| We're going to discuss budget, I think, on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| So my understanding is it probably will be a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| Ms. Horne asked for that to be a part of that discussion on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| So because procedurally I'm just trying to get a hold of how we have not really had a full conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:11| with the school system about, first of all, the 40 years, the numbers that are presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| the presentation that was presented, but just a basic conversation about what the school system needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| And this isn't 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| This is five years in terms of where we are and what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| And can that assessment be pulled together to say at this point what it is we need within the next five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:48| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| And, again, when I speak ideally, I realize, you know, there's a cost to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| And we also need school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| The situation down west where, you know, we're still, even with three new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| we're still looking at some overcrowding in Farragut Primary and Intermediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| You know, there's going to be a need probably to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| We put temporary classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| We're going to need to put, maybe look at even an additional school down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| And I say that because that's the direction I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| But we don't want to look at some procedural aspects in terms of zoning that will help impact some of the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:28| We don't want to look at where we are in terms of the needs for the capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| long term in some of the schools in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| We're making decisions, but we don't have an assessment of what it is the school system's core needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:44| I think looking overall, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| I'm not aware of an assessment that would be all inclusive of the needs and the population and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| Back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| In recognition of the lights, just so you all know where I am, I'm recognizing Commissioner Bussler, then Jay, then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Mr. Schoonmaker, you had not weighed in on this, so I think the other commissioners had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| So I'll recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| I guess Mr. Caldwell can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| So based on the conversation we've heard that the A.J. building and the Dwight Kessel garage, that joint bond has been retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:28| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| It was refunded in 2002 and I think retired in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| So we own both buildings with no debt on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Back to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| I see Mr. Thomas has left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| But anyway, is the economic impact that your office has on any community it moves into, what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:57| I think on your report here, there's a report that said $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| Is that right, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| So that's a number that we get from the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| And so the Chamber puts an economic impact of what it was to retain the school system jobs downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| They have a $70 million economic impact on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| Is it on the community in which they're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| If we moved it someplace else, it would have that kind of same impact on a community lying a little bit further outside in the city where it is now on Market Square Mall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:32| I think it's comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| I'm not saying it would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| I mean, I think it depends on where you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| So we could help out communities if we had to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| Instead of being downtown, we could move it into another community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| We could move it anywhere else and have that impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:57| I think we're at a point right now, between all of us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| where we have not assessed and asked the schools what they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| We've just told them what we're going to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| And I don't think that's the way you work between two systems like that and get anything accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| So we really need to have a little bit more discussion instead of working so quickly on something to do about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:23| was it October or whatever it is, to have that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| Will that in any way impact anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| By waiting a little bit longer and doing more discussion between the two bodies before we tell what we can't tell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| I mean, it's up to them where they want to move or leave or whatever it is out of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| So, anyway, I'm through with my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Commissioner Biggs, Director Colla, could you do me a favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| And if you're getting that information for Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| can you also give me the info by chance on the negative impact Kimberly-Clark had whenever they left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| Because it's about the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Or do you have that already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| I would have to ask the Chamber for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| I can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| I'll contact the Chamber and ask them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| But that's about the same size, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| And they do it by job and by things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Is that Commissioner Beeler's light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Go ahead, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| I just had a comment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| And I mean no disrespect to anyone here, Mr. Caldwell or your team or Mr. McPherson or your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| I understand the need for long-term projections, having worked in finance for 30-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:44| But 40-year projections are of negligible consequence to me in making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| I'd like to see a projection from 1979 on anything that is now correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| So just simply to say 40-year projections, while long-term projection may be necessary sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| it's very difficult to look at 40-year projections as actual numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| And back to Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| Your light was off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| I have a couple of questions for Chris Caldwell and a few questions for Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| Following up on Commissioner Smith's line of questioning, just follow along with me for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:34| As a general finance expert, when you buy a house, let's say you buy a house for $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| and you have a mortgage on that house and you pay off that mortgage over time, say 20, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:49| by the time you're done with all of the principal plus all of the interest, you may spend $350,000 on that house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| or $300,000 on that house all in by the time you get done with all the payments, all the interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| and the maintenance and the operating costs, utilities, fixing the roof shingles, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| You're going to have a much higher total investment in that house, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| But when most people sell a house, they don't get to sell the house for $300,000 unless the market says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5413)|
| 1:30:21| hey, that house is worth $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| It doesn't matter what you put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| The market may say, hey, you live in a neighborhood where your house is maybe worth $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| You don't get to say, well, I put in $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| I had all the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| I had all the electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| I had all the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| I painted the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| I fixed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| I fixed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| And I paid all the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| So that's not how the free market works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Yeah, I think historically speaking, if you're looking at your return on net investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| you would never count O&M costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| Okay, so you would never count O&M costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Or you would never count interest costs in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| It's just the cost of, in your example, it's the cost of the mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| It's the cost of the mortgage, the purchase price, and the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| So we have a building that, with all due respect, you don't get to value it $25 million as all in sunken costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| You get to value it at the market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| And the market rate, which we did a public bid for, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| And we asked for people to say, tell us what you would pay for this building if it was sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| and you were to redevelop it and put a massive amount of funding into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| And the best bid that we got was $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| and that has held true to a fairly accurate level of a price that the market will bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| We did do an appraisal two years ago, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Matt, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Two or three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| And for highest and best use of the building at that time, the AHA building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| was $7.8 million for highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| Highest and best use is not what the RFP came back at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| They came back at a mixed-use boutique hotel, which they're going to put $43 million into two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| So the professional appraisal said, at that level, it's worth about $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| Yeah, I think if you look to see what B&A was offering was six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| I think the second-ranked firm was at 5.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| Three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| They were three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Five-three, then five-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Superintendent Thomas, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| And your concerns for a number of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| Is the TVA building off the interstate, as you have hoped you would have a location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| It's nearby the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| It's nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Is it on the bus line, as you hoped your location would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Does it have parking for your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Yes, there's a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| It's like the one we have right down the street from Andrew Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Is it within blocks of other public parking garages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| And is it going to be ADA accessible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| I'm assuming it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| So all of the things that you've listed as a concern are all things that the TVA building has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| I don't think the access to that building is as easy as the access to Andrew Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| For security reasons, and I haven't worked on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| The law director has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| But they're going to provide the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| The TVA provides the security over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| And let me just say, too, operating cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| If you're worried about cost, you know, we've got a maintenance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| We've got an operations department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| We cover 10 million square feet of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| I don't know that we need PBA to manage that building for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| And back to the parking garage, you know, we were told, because I was here at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| that the proceeds, any additional revenue produced by the parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| would offset our cost to be in the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| I've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| I'm not opposed to selling, but I've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| I am just trying to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| I am trying to get the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| And about your analogy there, yeah, you know, buy a house and you sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| We've been told to leave our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| We've been told to take a house we own and go lease somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| And, again, I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| But let's get some real numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Let's get some facts so that we're all talking, you know, off the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| That's what's bothering me, just to accept the facts and not ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| I don't think anybody is saying don't ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| That's why we're doing our discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Did you ask questions about the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Where did these numbers come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| I did ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| How they were generated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Tell me what the renovation cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| What's the $15.6 million commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| It wasn't $15.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| Superintendent Thomas, I did ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| I did ask for the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| I did ask for the backup, including information from you, from Director Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| and from members of PB&L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Could we have a point of order here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Could we have a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Did I interrupt you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| No, but they're battering forth each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| Guys, if you want to ask questions, that's fine, but continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| I did ask for those questions, and I did ask for those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| and they do have real backup and real information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| And the cost was $15 million to renovate the AHA building based upon a basic formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| that professionals look at for renovation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| Was there an actual renovation plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| But this is what you do when you do estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| You look at the professional and you say, based on everything we know, go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| But I have a few other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I don't want to get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| I want to ask a few other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| You mentioned that this conversation has been fairly engaged since 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| It's been what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| You've had an engaging conversation with the mayor's offices for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| There's a press conference where the mayor, Burchett, and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| and then we've had Mayor Jacobs call me over, I think, maybe a month or so after he got in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:22| said, hey, we've reached a deal with the TVA Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| There will be a public announcement in a few days, and that's the extent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| That's the extent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| For me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| You know, I asked that question of the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| and I said, you know, it sounds like Superintendent Thomas hasn't been involved in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| because that was kind of how we were led to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| I said, geez, for a conversation that's been going on for two years in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| and at least the last ten years of the total conversation, that was confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| And I got a report back from them that said that approximately 56 meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| has happened between the Knox County schools and the mayor's offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| and 30 of those meetings are with school staff, your staff, including Russ Oak and Doug Dillingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| and you attended at least four of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| At what point in two years of discussions of 30 meetings with your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| and four meetings directly engaged do you not make your opinion known in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| I've made my opinion known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Today, not for two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| I made my opinion known at one point over in the Andrew Johnson building in the mezzanine room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| I don't know if Mr. Caldwell was there, but I think the architects were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| PBA was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| I just voiced a concern about moving to a location that really didn't improve, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| didn't improve from where we were to where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| Mr. Caldwell has heard me, I know, at least once talk about this way back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| I think back when it first was initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| But since then, nobody has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| You know, there's a difference between, in my mind, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| hey, here's what we're going to do to you or what do you want us to do to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| You know, nobody's ever said, hey, what would be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| What are your concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| If you don't feel like it was appropriate in two years of conversations to speak up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| I don't think as the superintendent and the head of the school system that this is a bad move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| and we should not do this and please don't spend my staff time and efforts to go down this path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| Well, you know, I've tried to get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| What I've said is it's been taught down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| Taught down meaning, hey, this is what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| You know, the board's been totally left out of the conversation as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| You know, again, that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| You know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| I just can't agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| And, again, I just want to see the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| I want the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| I want honesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| I want transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| And just because I didn't accept the numbers that were presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| I'm made to look like, you know, I'm just opposed to this, which I'm not opposed to selling the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| But if you're going to do something, do something that's going to better the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| I don't think this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| And that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| If you want to criticize me for it, if you want to fire me for it, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| Well, no, I think that I don't think there's anybody on this panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| and this governing body that would disagree with you having an ability to have your own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| That's not the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| But to say that no one's been involved to the facts aren't the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| that people that are professionals in this industry are putting out fake numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| I mean, it just seems disingenuous to have two years of a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| and to allow it to get to this point with a ton of due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| and then sort of go, well, you know, nobody's at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| And I think that it's just a disingenuous statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| You can disagree with the idea all you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| but you can't disrespect that people have put a huge amount of work into trying to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| that would better the school district, better the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| and help the local economy in a significant way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| I'll leave my questions at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| I think it's important to go on record that this has been a really significant engagement for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| and it seems like that that ought to be part of the equation in talking about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the allowance to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| There's been a lot of talk about the school system and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| This body has an overall big picture umbrella type of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| We have a school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| We have a detention system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| We have engineering, libraries, health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| There are many things we have to look over and do what's best for the overall picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| As far as putting the A.J. building back on the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| a lot of people are saying, well, it's going to get a TIF or a PILOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| It's not going to bring a lot of money in off of property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| Probably true, but spending time on the Development Corps Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| and understanding how important it is for us in Knox County to be able to recruit businesses and people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| how important a vibrant downtown is and how much that assists us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| Even though a company may locate out in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| they want to be someplace that there's that type of downtown, that kind of energy, that kind of synergy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| We have one of our greatest, most iconic buildings being used as a government office house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:38| I think it would do a lot for our downtown if we could get that back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| At the same time, I think if we question these numbers, look into these numbers, dig deep into these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| we're going to see this is a pretty good sweetheart deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| Just look at the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Just start with it and then work backwards towards the towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Busler, and then Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:08| Go ahead, Commissioner Gil, if you'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I'd like to see a list of questions from the school system about what their concerns and thoughts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:21| because I can understand how a decision can be made in a process driven to support that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| without us doing additional due diligence on behalf of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:36| There was a comment made at the work session regarding the fact that we are the elected body from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:45| See, that's a point noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| I certainly would like to hear what the conversation with the general public would be regarding some of the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:54| that must take place because I'd like to hear what the general public has to say about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| That would be the first thing, an additional conversation in terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| I'm coming to make a tour of the building, but I also think that we really need to look at the fact that our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:15| has already been developed. Thank you, District 1 is one of the best districts we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| But the accessibility of this tower is not where any, it is not publicly accessible. It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:30| And I think if we're looking at some real decisions to make, we need to hear on behalf of what the school system's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:38| questions and concerns are and to make sure those are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| We have not done a very good job of that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| Erringer, have you weighed in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| The TVA Tower has been empty for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:05| Why has it been empty for 15 years and now all of a sudden it's the greatest place to move to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| I have to agree with Commissioner Gill, and I believe Mr. Thomas said this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| the AHA building right now is more accessible than down here at the TVA Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| I mean, it's just to go down there to eat, you know, you've got to park in Market Square parking garage or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:36| it's difficult sometimes going to find a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:45| So, anyway, and then the biggest thing that I was told about putting the AHA back on the tax row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:53| which it is not going to be put back on the tax row for several years, so it's not the day we sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6293)|
| 1:45:02| it's getting back on the tax row and we're going to get property taxes from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| I was told that the schools, that the county wanted to move their schools, the schools to a place that we would own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:15| We did not want to lease. We wanted to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| And that's why some places did not get looked at or they got looked at, but they wouldn't work because we wanted to own them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:25| So, leasing and doing a 15-year thing with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| I don't understand what now the big hurry is because there's been talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| and all of a sudden we get actually some numbers of things about, what, a week and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| So, what is the big rush that we have to make this decision and vote on it by the end of October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:51| Because I believe interest rates will be going down a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| Also, I believe the AHA building should have increased because property in downtown has increased the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6355)|
| 1:46:04| because this is a very thriving place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| So, I do think it's being hurried and it bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| It's kind of like being at TBA, it was a great deal and all, why is it sitting empty for 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| Why hasn't somebody else gotten in there and already been using that and paying property taxes on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:28| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| I believe Commissioner Bussler, you chimed in earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| I'm sorry, Chris, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| I'm sorry, I'm trying to go through our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| A few things, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| First, TBA is not on the tax roll, so there's never been any property taxes taken or collected from TBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:49| Second, sometimes it's cheaper to lease than to own, and this is one of those instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| Sometimes it's cheaper to lease and we don't have to worry about ADA cost or upgraded on maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6414)|
| 1:47:04| It is not true that we won't collect any property taxes from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| If they try to get a pilot, then that is still money that we would receive from that pilot that we're not receiving currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:18| So we will be receiving money as it relates to the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| To answer your question about, yes, property values have increased in downtown the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:33| and those construction costs offset the cost of the amount of appraisal on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:43| And so those are just answers to your questions that you posed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| And so I think ultimately when you look at this, it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| You get to put an iconic building back on the tax roll, more than likely a pilot, but still that is revenue that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6475)|
| 1:48:08| And you get to go to, I think, what's actually considered Class B office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| And currently we're residing in a former hotel that we have converted into office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:22| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Mr. Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| I've got another question that Mr. Caldwell brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| In places where TVA has buildings and things, they do pay some sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| Payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Pay in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| No, that's the utility line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| It's like a pay in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| And so they are paying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| I know they've got to be paying something, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| They pay a payment in lieu of tax for utility line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| Well, that's KUB for utility lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| But TVA does it for the land underneath the rivers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| I don't, they probably include something for their physical structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| But I don't know what that value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| But we do receive revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| We don't know what the value is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| But we'll, through the lease program, we'll be paying ourselves taxes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| But that's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| The problem is we're talking about property and how you sell property and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| And it's a different way than what we just put a bid out and say, well, I want you to bid on this piece of property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| If you're going to sell a big piece of commercial property, which that is over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| you go and you look for people that sell that kind of property day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| Right now, if you figure out it, that piece of property over there is, what, 42 cents a square foot that we sold it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:48| Is that basically what it is if you figure it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Where at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| AJ Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| Where we sell it at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Yeah, if you sell it for $6 million and it's, what, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| $125,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| $125 a square foot, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| No, $125,000 square feet is the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| But if you divide it in there, it's not a lot of money we're selling it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| But they're going to put money in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| It's going to raise the value in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| We're going to get down the road sometime, great taxes off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| What we've got right now, though, is we've got a school system right here that when they were talking about being close to the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| what about their maintenance trucks and all the other trucks that they have that goes all around there that's got access to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| But they want some place that they can have it, control theirs in one location and have access to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:44| It's just not, well, you can go down here to the AJ Tower and all that you're getting access for is the people that are working the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:52| over here at the AJ Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| But having said that, we're talking about stuff that we don't know that's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| We don't know if the school board is going to say, yes, we want to go ahead and sell the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| We don't know that, but we've wasted a lot of time discussing something that the school board will, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| tell us where they will accept it or they won't accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| So I don't understand what we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| So could, until they tell us that they're going to sell it and let us sell it, we're just wasting our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Commissioner Smith, you want to be the last comment on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Yes, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| The law director had said something about surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| How is that building titled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| I believe PBA owns the building, but the title of the building is not important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| It's custody and control under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| If it's used for educational purposes or educational functions and it's assigned to the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| they have custody and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Before we can do anything with it, whether they're using it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| for example, rule, they have to surplus it, even though that is titled in Knox County, before we can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:09| That's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| I want to point out something because I don't want the people to get the perception of something that is not correct here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:24| This commission and past commissions have shown a lot of support for the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| and I just want to ask Director Caldwell, what kind of debt is the county holding for the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:46| You're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| What kind of debt is on our books that has gone for the purpose of schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| I think going back to the Ragsdale administration, so around 2002 to current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| we have taken on about a little over $100 million of debt that's education-related debt that we pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| We have got, it looks like, 13 minutes until we need to open the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:33| To be really clear, there's no way we can get through the rest of our commission agenda and impact this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| The next big item that I know will warrant some discussion, I know that earlier in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| Mayor Jacobs brought to us a request to hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| I would like to try to see, I don't know where the vote's going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| but I'd like to try to begin that discussion right now in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| So I believe we did add that to our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| and I guess the Chair will entertain a motion for discussion to authorize Mayor Jacobs, in his words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| I think it was, to hire an attorney for the county to defend that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| So we have a motion from Commissioner Jay and a second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Now, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| I think that statement is very broad, and we're going to, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| and I need to make sure we obviously have legal representation to guide that advice or assistance better in the motion itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6866)|
| 1:54:37| And I think we need to get some direction on better language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Sounds very, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| I understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| I'm going to also recognize Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| I ask a question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| I'm not sure what this lawsuit is really saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| I just got it this afternoon and started reading through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| But now we say we've got to have legal representation from the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| Is this a, I need to know what kind of action this is, what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| And citizens did bring this against us, the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| So we've got to know what the citizens are asking us for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| And it's like we're going to bow up and we're going to go back after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| What are they asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| And why do we need to have a lawyer hired when we do have legal counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| Is there a reason why we're doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| I'll go ahead and kind of state my non-lawyerly take on the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| Now, it's only recently I've had a chance to review it, just like you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| I think having talked about the law director and the mayor immediately before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| I think the mayor is concerned that you might have a potential conflict with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| And I think the law director understands that the mayor would probably want to go ahead and hire an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| and take the lead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| I'm not trying to put words into your mouth, Bud, but I'm just sort of trying to paraphrase our conversation beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| Yet I think we would probably need to, in order to authorize the mayor to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| probably need to pass some sort of resolution to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| Mr. Law Director, am I fairly stating kind of what we visited on shortly before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| or, excuse me, right after the beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| Well, there are several issues I think that the mayor is concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:40| Number one, we have different parties in this lawsuit and we have different issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:47| or different facts in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| The issue is one that has already been brought before that this body dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| and asked the law director's office to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| The question of what was read earlier is yet to be ascertained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| The real issue here is, is the law director conflicted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| I may or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| There's two ways to go about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| I would be more than willing to work with the mayor and try to help him, you know, hire the lawyer he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| I've made that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| He doesn't know that yet, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Or this board can vote to have him hire someone to represent the county in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:35| But this case is what they're asking for is a legal issue question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:44| I haven't read it to where they're asking for really damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| This is a declaratory judgment question as to whether commission, the way I'm reading it so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:54| has the power to increase the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| And the last question we had was did the pension board have the power to create the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| So it's kind of two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| But the question in the end is the power to increase the UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| So I don't particularly care, you know, about whether the law director's office is in it or not in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:19| And I want Knox County to feel comfortable with how they're represented in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:26| And there's different strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| If the law director's office selects to hire someone under our authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| I would most likely assign it to the mayor to be the representative and the point of view of how the case goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:42| If the commission has the mayor hire somebody, then it's the same effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| Except one you have to appropriate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| The other one can be managed through the law director's budget to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7131)|
| 1:59:02| So I really don't care which way you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| The mayor and I haven't really talked about this as to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| I just heard what you heard a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| I didn't know about the lawsuit until Friday when I got a phone call about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| And I asked if it was in electronic format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| And they said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| I said, well, I'll wait until Monday to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| I'm not going to ruin my weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| So I came in this morning and read over it, and I saw the issues and what's really going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:34| And I'd really like to discuss it with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| But this body can do whatever it wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| The law director has the authority under the charter to hire you counsel when I'm conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| And this body has the authority to hire counsel for the mayor if requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| So it's what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| It's just how it gets paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| Mr. Armstrong, is there a timeline in which when a case is filed you must respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:13| Well, there's two ways to look at a declaratory judgment action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| If you're going to contest the declaratory judgment on the facts, then you shall answer the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| If you are not and you just want a legal opinion based upon a question, you don't have to answer the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| Usually the deadline for either choice is 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| And I don't know when we got served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| I guess it was Friday sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| So, you know, the clock's running, but it's not insurmountable at this point of the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7241)|
| 2:00:48| Either way, whatever you do or not do, we're going to have an attorney hired sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:55| Whether the mayor hires an attorney or the law director hires an attorney, somebody's going to be hired to handle this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| It's not just going to be sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Even though you have 30 days, it's prudent to, if you're going to dig in, then get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7264)|
| 2:01:11| I'd rather be in the game early than in the game late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| And so you don't want to ‑‑ I'm pointing that out because it's not something we want to punt until next month to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| Chairman, I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| The motion on the floor is a simple resolution with wording that simply says the Knox County Commission authorizes the mayor of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:34| to retain independent legal counsel as it relates to this pending lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| That's probably about as simple and as clean as I could think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| Now, if we pass that resolution, that simple resolution, the mayor still might go to the law department to discuss it and get recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7304)|
| 2:01:55| or have advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| I mean, it doesn't mean that the law department is out of that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| Well, it depends how you pass the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| You can say in consultation with the law director's office or you can give him total power to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| It's entirely up to the policy of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| But it does not, if we were to approve the motion on the floor of authorizing the mayor of Knox County to retain independent legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:20| as it relates to this lawsuit, that would not prevent him from coming and talking to you or having further engagement with you as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| as the law director of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| It would not prevent him, nor it would require him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| No, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Brad, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| I wasn't sure which light came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| Similar statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Even though we give him authorization, that doesn't mean he has to engage that authorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| And so was that in form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| I had to step out for a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| Was that a motion already made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| I believe the motion on the floor is for Knox County Commission to authorize the mayor of Knox County to retain independent legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7373)|
| 2:03:00| as it relates to the pending lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| But we do know that he does not have to engage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| It's just a tool for him to have, and I think that's important for us to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| I'll be supporting that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| I would request that you amend it to at least address the style of the case so you'll know what the pending case is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| We've got, like, five or six or eight or ten pending cases right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| As it relates to case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| Specify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| To be specific to this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| I know there's a word I was trying to pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Who's the first name on the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| I just recognized Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| There's the Edders v. Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| Commissioners, I just recognized Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| My question is real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| I think the law director said this is a deck action, and I think you said it was to answer a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7441)|
| 2:04:08| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| Yes, it's generally to ask a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| It's not a matter of fact or damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| They just want to know, one way or the other, what a question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| And I'm not sure what the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| The question is whether the county commission has the authority through its powers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:33| the way I've read it so far, and I haven't analyzed it too deeply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| do they have the power to increase the payment under the uniformed officer's pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| If the commission here does, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| Wouldn't you all want to know if we have the power or not to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| Would this commission not want to know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| That's my question to the rest of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| It's a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| We don't have to pay a lawyer, do we, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| Well, I would never want Knox County to not be represented in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| And, you know, under these, like I said, they can be answered or they can go as a matter of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7512)|
| 2:05:18| And that's a policy decision as to what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| That's why I said even if I hired an attorney under my powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| I would be talking to the mayor or somebody as to what position do you want us to take on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:32| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| So if the mayor hires outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| he will be talking to that counsel on what position he wants to take on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| You can take no position and it will be a question of law and the judge will answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| You can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| You can make motions to disqualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| You can make motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| There's all kinds of legal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| If you don't want it heard, there's legal approaches to get it from being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| If you want it heard, then it's all about how you want to direct and how you want to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| And those are policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| So the question before you is do you want the mayor to hire the lawyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| And that's what he's requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| And you all have made a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| I just said clarify the case so you'll know which one he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Either way, like I said, if the law director's office hired it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| I would probably hire it in consultation with the mayor anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| because this is one that I've been down this road before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| and don't particularly want to go down this road again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:36| So we would be looking for outside counsel to do this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| As you're the counsel of commission here, what would you suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| I suggest that it's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| You have the authority to do it either way you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| And I'm not picking sides on this because I really don't care that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| I care that we're represented and we're represented effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| And that's going to happen, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| I haven't talked to the mayor about it, but I believe either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| I would hope that he would come in consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| because there are some issues about certain counsel that he may look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| that they may not be eligible to do based upon this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| But I would rather talk to the, you know, give counsel advice regarding that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:28| But he can go do whatever he wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| depending on how you all pass a resolution and what authority you give him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| If you don't do anything under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| I'm going to hire some counsel to represent Knox County in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| And then I'm going to consult with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| since I'm not going to consult with 11 people and wait on resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| I'm going to go down the hall and talk to the mayor and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| how would you like to see this handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| What is your policy position in speaking for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| Then whatever that is, we'll turn that lawyer over to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| And as far as I'm concerned, I'm done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| unless they need something from the law director's office, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| to help them and do whatever it is they want done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| So it's all the same work to me one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| We are at the start of when we need to conduct our zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| We do have a motion on the floor, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| I'm just going to let everybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| We will have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| We are going to have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| What I'm going to also do is for everyone who's here for a zoning matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| I want to ask for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| After this vote and after this is wrapped up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| we are going to have a ten-minute recess for the commissioners to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:48| have a bathroom break, and then we'll come back and reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| I'm going to ask each of the commissioners to briefly add discussion items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| to state your point before we conduct the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| In order, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| I just wanted to know if we were inserting as an amendment on the resolution on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| the floor to clarify the case, which is what Randy is about to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| Now, Mr. Smith, would you like to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| No, I'd like a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Do I have the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| Jay had the motion second by Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| The friendly amendment is to include the, I believe this is the docket number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| and it is 198839-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| We have a friendly amendment to the first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Are you all amenable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| The Chair recognizes that both the first and the second are nodding their heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| Now, moving back to discussion, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| and then I'll recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:51| It's difficult for us to do our due diligence when we get something like this at the 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| And so I'm trying to look at the information that's been presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| There's a July 1 letter that was sent to the Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| the Chairman of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| and the Chairman of the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| Per the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| when a legal document comes to the Knox County Mayor's office, as they all do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| it's immediately supposed to go to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| I'm assuming that if a legal document comes to the Chairman of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| that he forwards that document to his attorney, which is the law director of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:41| What I don't understand is, apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| the law director's office doesn't find out until Friday of this past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| that there's some kind of action in play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| and somebody who is not a Knox County attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| files a response on behalf of Knox County to the attorney that sent the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:07| I'm kind of confused how we've had something in the hopper since July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:13| but nobody knows about it until Friday or this morning of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:19| So I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| why have we not followed the procedures that are in the Charter of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7881)|
| 2:11:27| when a document comes in that's legal in nature that immediately goes to the law director's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| Because did any of your office receive a letter on July 1 or July 2 or July 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| As a matter of fact, when I heard about the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| I thought, well, this will be easy to dispose of because there are administrative steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| that are necessary to happen before you actually file a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| Once I got here and read the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| I found out for sure that there had been basically what's called a demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| Well, a demand is a precursor generally administratively to a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| And I'd heard of a rumor of one, but it was said that it was not substantiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:14| So I didn't go digging up rocks to find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| And I do know, I still don't know for a fact that there has been one because I've never seen one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7938)|
| 2:12:24| but it would have been nice to know so we could have at least addressed it on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| I heard that a pension lawyer may have addressed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| but they don't have the authority under the Charter to address a demand of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| That is a little disturbing to me as the elected official to handle the legal affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| and I'm not understanding why everything is going the way that it is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| But I can't worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| I have to deal with where I find myself, and this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| A follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| I don't have an answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| Were you told not to notify the law director's office about this letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| No, it came when that letter came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| I believe it came to our capacity when we were on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| And frankly, I believe when we thought that there was probably a threat to sue the pension board instead of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:30| Even though the other ones were listed in the mayor's office, the chairman of commission and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| My take was probably that the mayor, if he was going to be doing anybody, informed the law department that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| But no, my take when I first saw it was that, oh, it looks like they're going to be suing the pension board again, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| So how did an attorney for the pension board file the response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:53| Who directed that person to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Was that the chairman of the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| Gosh, I can't remember exactly the details on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| I just recall specifically that we thought that was probably a threat letter related to a lawsuit for the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:18| Personally, I think any matters that come that affect Knox County, that those matters should be handled by the Knox County Law Director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:28| And if it's their option that they don't feel like that they have staff that can handle a specific case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:35| then they have a budget to be able to go to outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| I think legal matters should be held the responsibility of the elected law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:47| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Your light's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| In order, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| Can I just jump in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Actually, going in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| I think I have an answer for Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| I'm going to go ahead and recognize everybody in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| So even though Commissioner Schoonmaker's question came to me, we'll recognize them in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Actually, Commissioner Daley, have you had a chance to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| I guess I've got Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8110)|
| 2:15:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Mr. Mayor, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:30| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| The law director said he is willing to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| We could probably solve this quickly if you're agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| Will you go to the mayor or, I'm sorry, to the law director and if you already have your counsel in mind or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:47| let the law director hire that outside counsel and we really don't need this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| We can get on with our proper business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| I believe that since the law director's a plaintiff in the last lawsuit, he does have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| I would prefer to hire on my own in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I think I have an answer to your conundrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| There's two different legal bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| There's the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board, and that is a different legal entity than Knox County separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:25| And I serve on that pension board along with other fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| And when that original letter came, it was sent to the Pension and Retirement Board directly, not to Knox County in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8189)|
| 2:16:38| And so essentially it was an intention letter to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| Now, if the linear path had followed that, it would have been a lawsuit against the Pension and Retirement Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| But that has already happened and it has been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| And so the action that was filed on Friday was against Knox County separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| So there wasn't ever a letter sent to Knox County that would have been flagged as a Knox County lawsuit about to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:08| It was sent to this other independent body over here that has its own legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| So when the letter is sent to its own, the Pension and Retirement Board, the lawyer for the Pension and Retirement Board responded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8232)|
| 2:17:19| Mr. Owings responded almost immediately saying, we have received your letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| Here's why we don't think your letter is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8244)|
| 2:17:26| And that all happened in the month of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| And it has been radio silence since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| So the lawyer for the plaintiffs last Friday did not sue this other entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| They sued Knox County, which is a separate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| So the letter never went to Knox County in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| These are two different bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Can I just ask a quick question to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| Civilly, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| Oh, yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| So it's your contention that they never sent a letter to Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| and there was never a letter sent to Hugh Nice from Chairman of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| I don't know about the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| I just know that the Retirement and Pension Board did receive a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| We were notified on the board of that letter, and the lawyer for the Pension and Retirement Board responded to that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:09| I don't have that letter in front of me, so I can't tell you the exact verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| I'm telling you that it was in that body of the Pension and Retirement Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:18| This lawsuit is for Knox County in total, which is a totally separate world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:23| That's why it's not overlapped, and that's why it's not been responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| Any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| Mr. Palmer, I have your lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| I've heard the explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| and I can't speak on how the lawyers for the Pension Board advised the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| but it has been ruled and adjudicated by the court that as far as litigation goes for the Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:55| the litigant lawyer for the Pension Board, by case that we just settled, is the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8335)|
| 2:19:02| The lawyers for the Pension Board are only there to advise the operation of a quality pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:11| and that was adjudicated in the case that we just got dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:16| and it was ordered by the Chancellor in that issue that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| as all other entities of Knox County where litigation is concerned, it is the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:29| It is not the lawyers of the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| I'm surprised that the pension lawyers didn't advise the Pension Board of that conclusion of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| by that particular Chancellor in that particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| So regardless of who the letter came to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| it should have been submitted to the Knox County Law Director as the litigant counsel for that entity of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267190923part1?start=8385)|
