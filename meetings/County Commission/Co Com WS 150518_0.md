| 0:00:06| Commissioner Smith, will you lead us in the pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=6)|
| 0:00:09| Everyone please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=9)|
| 0:00:14| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=14)|
| 0:00:19| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=19)|
| 0:00:23| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=23)|
| 0:00:32| Madam Clerk, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| Commissioner McKenzie. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| Commissioner Broyles. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| Commissioner Smith. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| Commissioner Ombi. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| Commissioner Anders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| Commissioner Bussler. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| Commissioner Wright. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Commissioner Brown. Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| Commissioner Thomas. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| Commissioner Brantley. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| We have 10 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| Okay. We're going to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| I sent an email out earlier of things that are not to be on the proposed consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| It will be 14, 33, 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| And Commissioner Schoonmaker had asked for 43 to be off consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| but I believe it's a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| It will come up in zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| If we want to, we can discuss it, but it will be in zonings voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=71)|
| 0:01:21| Is there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| I would like to, on item four, defer that for another month for family convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=85)|
| 0:01:31| Commissioner Ombi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| Yeah, I just wanted to make known on item 10, it's on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| that I have a sister-in-law that's listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| It's a non-pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| Anybody else? Amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Did you say we're going to defer 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| It's a solar project. It's not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| What we're going to do is combine 14 and I believe it's 33, the other solar item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| And then 36, April asked that we move that without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=129)|
| 0:02:20| So in our motion, that will be part of the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| If you guys don't mind, they're still finalizing that with Covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| So that will be moved without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| I ask that item nine be removed by the sponsor, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| Off the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Off the agenda, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| Is he not resigning now or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| He has resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| It's a problem with the appointee that we were unaware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| I'll be talking to you soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| Is he still going to resign currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Chris Cobble, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| I would like to add two line item transfers that I handed to the clerk to begin the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| They're basically just cleaning up some negative balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| BVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| We would like to add item 42, but it actually probably would not require any discussion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| We provided you a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| I just wanted the commission to have that because it includes an awful lot of information that would be useful for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| in your discussion with constituents about recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| We try very hard to encourage people to recycle, not from an environmental perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| but from an economic perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| The information that's on there is just a nice graphic representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| or graphical representation of how recycling works and why it works so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| Certainly, we'd be glad to answer questions next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| but the main purpose of adding the item to the agenda was just to distribute the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| A question for Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| BVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Do you have these that could be placed around in communities, or is this just limited supply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| We do have a PDF of it that we can maintain on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| If I could avoid distributing 200,000 laminated copies of it, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| But other than that, it's readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| That's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Any other additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Is there a motion to move, subtract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| I need a motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Is there a motion to approve the minutes from the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Give the clerks just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| If it's okay with the board, item 14, which is 202, and also item 33 were both the solar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=327)|
| 0:05:41| So if it's okay with the board, we can discuss those two items together if nobody objects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Do we need to move them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| No, there's only, they're the only, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| I don't think there's any moving up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| The first item is listed on page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| It's resolution 202, approving an energy services agreement with Amoresco Incorporated for the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=367)|
| 0:06:16| and installation of solar photovoltaic generation units or facilities as part of Knott's County Solar Solution Services Project at A.L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| Lotz Elementary School, Amherst Elementary School, Bearden Middle School, Central High School, Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=384)|

| 0:06:39| and West Valley Middle School at a total cost of $9,291,315.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| Approving a measurement verification agreement and production guarantee with Amoresco Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| for the performance of measurement and verification services following the completion of the project at the aforementioned sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| Approving power purchase agreements with the Tennessee Valley Authority for each of the aforementioned sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| Approving interconnection, metering, and parallel operation agreements with the Knoxville Utilities Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| for Amherst Elementary School, Bearden Middle School, Central High School, L&N STEM Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| Powell Middle School, South Doyle Middle School, and West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| And approving facilities and parallel operation agreements with the Lenore City Utilities Board for A.L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=445)|

| 0:07:37| Approval of the aforementioned agreements is contingent on agreement between the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and Knox County Commission on distribution of any and all future energy incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| There's a motion and a second. Let's go ahead and read, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| I'll get down to the bottom line. Mr. Law Director, where are we on deciding who gets what part of the pie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=475)|
| 0:08:08| Where are we on the distribution of energy saving funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| I think it's in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| But it says here, depending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| This is for any added incentive in the future that you all will negotiate with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| In other words, if KUB or TVA or someone offers an additional energy incentive out in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| that may have a bearing on this program, then you all would negotiate how that would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| It's not to do with what is before you at this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| I think the comment, Hugh, do you want to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=526)|
| 0:08:55| I've got Emma Resko here to talk about the project and answer any questions for the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| Chris and I are here, as well as Mark Mametoff, who is working the finance part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| Can you give us a brief overview of what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| What you have are nine school sites, three county sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| All the school sites are roof-mounted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| One of the county sites is roof-mounted, which is Knox Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| The other two are ground mounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| This is a result of a project that Dr. McIntyre and Mayor Burchett had us start working on a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| to look at opportunities in solar for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| As you guys may recall, about a year or so ago, we went through a similar process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| At the end of it, TVA changed the rules in the middle of the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| so we had to back up and reassess where we were at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| We issued a request for qualifications, and we hired Emma Resko as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| We've been working with Emma Resko now for approximately a year to come up with this solar solution for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| I guess my general question is for the site decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| I don't know if it's for you or for the representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| but one of the things that concern me are those ground-mounted units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| and especially the one at, I don't mind necessarily the one at the detention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| but the other one looks, now this is John Tarleton, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| Correct. This is John Tarleton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| Yeah, that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| When we look at the congestion and the use of that land, we have very little land out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| and that's really a parks and rec, I don't know if Doug wants to speak on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| but that's a pretty valuable site, and folks come from all corners of the county weekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| sometimes biweekly, to that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| So for us to take up such a large footprint when I know parking is an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| I just don't know if that particular one is worth the dollars and cents that we would coop from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| So I guess if you could just walk me through why you chose to take up such valuable land for this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=683)|
| 0:11:33| We've got plenty of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| We've got plenty of rooftops, I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| I mean, why this particular one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| I'll defer to Amarisco and let them take you through the thought process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| but one of the criteria as part of site selection was those very issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| the current use of the land, the proximity of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| and this one in particular, I think we're in Doug's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| He can answer any of your questions regarding the site itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| but we're using that southward-facing slope, which really there's no parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| That property, as far as I know, is not utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| It is green space there behind the football field, which would be the north section of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=740)|
| 0:12:29| But I'll let Tom with Amarisco address it in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| Commissioner, I can address that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Doug Battelle, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Yeah, as you mentioned, that is a south-facing slope up above the football fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| kind of between the football fields and the home on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| So it is unutilized space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| They did have it in a different location at first, but that's a really good slope right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| because we don't use it, all we do is mow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Working on open solar panels reduces mowing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| It's a good utilization there, and it will not affect our sports programs at the park at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| I guess, as you said, there's also, I mean, not necessarily for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| but there's other uses of that facility, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| We probably moved a lot of dirt because it was all kind of slopey at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| and we made flat areas out of it to suit our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| You know, the whole John Taunton facility as well is something to be utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| I just, just that particular footprint, it's pretty tight in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| and there's multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple uses of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| So that would, I mean, again, I'm not, I'm pro-solar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| I'm pro this project, but that particular site, I guess when I say we have so many potentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| that's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Do you have any questions of the MRSCO, Sam, or are you satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| I mean, I guess the question is, does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| does the slope give you so much, a lot more advantages in terms of efficiencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Is that getting more sunlight than any of these others combined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| I'm just wondering what the thought process was for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Tom Nicholas with MRSCO, and a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| One of the main things we looked at when we developed this program was not just the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| That was a major component of it, but was the energy usage of the sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| because these will be load side connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| They're going to offset the energy usage of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| And so the first thing we looked at was which buildings were appropriate from a load standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| to make the cost per KWH effective over the term of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| So the main reason that site was selected was it's consistent and pretty high load usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| made it a good candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And then following that, working with Doug and the team, the site was vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| and that was considered to be underutilized space that was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=893)|
| 0:15:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Just a few questions, just so I can be clear, which may be in some people's minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| and maybe we can get the answers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Let's say, for example, we build these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| Of the money that it costs, $12.5 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| How much of that is for the panels, and how much of that is labor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Do you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I don't have that number off the top of my head, but I would say it's probably 60-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| 60% materials and 40% labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Oh, really? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| How long does it take to install this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Our construction schedule currently is anticipated to be December 31st of the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| So it could all be done by the end of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Yes, sir, six to seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Let's say they're damaged or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| Some of these panels quit working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Are they guaranteed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Do we have to pay to replace them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| The panels have a 25-year performance warranty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| and they're guaranteed to produce the same amount that they produced the day they were put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| that they're designed for, with a 0.5% degradation factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| So they're allowed to degradate up to 0.5%, which is included in our financial model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| And anything more than that would require the manufacturer to replace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| We're not paying to replace them in five years, half of them quit working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| or ten of them quit working, or one of them quits working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| And how fragile are they, if at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| I mean, can they withstand all this hail we just had a few years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| They can, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I think a good example are the panels we installed for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| They've been installed since 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| and I think they went through one of the largest hailstorms in the area in the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| and not a single panel was damaged and had to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| What if we don't get two panels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Had to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| That's all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| What if we don't get the return that you listed here that's average for your company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| Then Ameresco will owe you for the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| I'm doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| I'm probably going to show my technical ignorance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| The panels are a 25-year guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| The most important part, it's a converter or what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| The inverter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| The inverters have a 20-year warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| The standard on it is a 10-year warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Did you all double up on that warranty to 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Kind of like an automobile, it has a 10-year bumper-to-bumper warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| The 25-year performance warranty on the panels stays in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| as long as the county completes a once-a-year inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| and submits their paperwork to the manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| If in year 11 the county were not to do that, then the extra 15 years would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| But as long as the paperwork, which is pretty minimal, is completed, it's 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| Now, on the inverter, it comes with a standard 10-year warranty, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| We opted for the 20-year for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| It was my understanding with conversations through your company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| that you all doubled that warranty, bought the extra extended warranty on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I just wanted to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| How many panels do you have up in the United States at the present time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| We have approximately, I don't know the exact number of panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| but we've installed and either own and operate or have installed for clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| close to 70 megawatts of solar photovoltaic energy throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Seven megawatts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Seventy megawatts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Seventy megawatts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| So convert that down to how many panels do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Each panel is about 300 watts, so I don't have to get my calculator out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| It's probably, I'm speculating here, but it's in the upper hundreds of thousands of panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| And how many states do you operate in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| All throughout the United States and Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| And where's your company located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| We're based out of Framingham, Massachusetts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| I will say we do have a very large Knoxville office as well, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| I'd say you should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Commissioner Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| You made a statement just a while ago about if it didn't perform like it was supposed to be performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| that your company would owe the county the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| How would that be paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| It would be paid through a check directly to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Ed, I had your exact same question, and I had the company send me a list of the organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| and particularly schools and the municipalities that they had worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| and it was quite a long, impressive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| It was impressive or non-impressive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Just one more quick question I have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| When you install these, do you use local labor, or do you bring in your own people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| It'll be local labor, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| May I just have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| It's been informed by the clerk that we failed to vote on the consent calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| so I'll need a motion for consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| May I just have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| I believe the next, what was the next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| We'll have to vote on the second item, item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Item 33, listed on page 12, resolution 805,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| is approving an energy services agreement with MRS Cohen Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| for the construction and installation of solar photovoltaic generation units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| or facilities as part of Knox County's solar solution services project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| at the detention facility, juvenile justice facility in Knox County Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| at a total cost of $3,158,685.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| Approving a measurement verification agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| and production guarantee with MRS Cohen Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| for the performance of measurement and verification services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| following the completion of the project at the aforementioned sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Approving power purchase agreements with the Tennessee Valley Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| for each of the aforementioned sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| and approving interconnection, metering, and parallel operation agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| with the Council Utilities Board for each of the aforementioned sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| This question is probably for Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| So in terms of the construction piece of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| and I'm sure it's in the document somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| and I'll freely admit I hadn't read every line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| but what happens along the way if we end up with a roof leak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| we end up with a hole in the window that wasn't supposed to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Are there deductibles on our end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Do they take care of all of it, or if it comes five years in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| we can say that this came because of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Well, as I spoke earlier about the criteria for selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| one of the things we looked at was we want to put these on roofs that were newer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| where we knew that we wouldn't have to be removing the roof any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| or the units any time soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| And Ameresco is working with each roofing company to make sure that they don't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| that voids the warranties and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| But if it is something that they caused, they're on the hook for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| And I'll let Tom speak to it, I guess, more in detail from the Ameresco side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| And I'm sure you probably have some experience with that over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| I'm sure everything had never always been perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| But, say, if there's a roof warranty underneath, you do your thing on top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| and there's an issue that comes out, I'm sure there will be some negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| But let's say it's deemed to be the roofing contractor's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| Do you remove yours and then put it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| And then the other way around, if it's your responsibility, then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| Well, as Hugh said, all the roofs were selected on purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| that are currently under warranty and should be for the term of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| As part of our due diligence, we actually met with each and every roof manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| And they, I guess backing up a little bit, all the systems we're looking at for roof mount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| are ballasted roof mounted, so they'll be set on the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| There should be no penetrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| And as part of the due diligence as well, there will be a letter from each manufacturer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| that the warranty will not be voided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| So anything that does happen to the roof, they will have to come, move the panel, repair it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| and then fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| Mr. Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| Or is it Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Just a quick question, just so I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| On these two resolutions, the only thing different about them is one is the jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| and one are the schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Okay, just so I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| There's not some other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Actually, one of them we share with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| The other is 100% county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Oh, that's county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Our central building, John Tarleton and Penal Farm is county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| and the other schools are split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| John Tarleton or it's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| It's the juvenile detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| John Tarleton property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| John Tarleton property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| It's the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| I just want to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Yeah, this question is for Mr. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| In 2007, we installed the solar panels out at the detention facility to heat the hot water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| And I realize it's a different manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Are you still pleased with those panels and they're still working well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| Yeah, we've been heating 16,000 gallons of water a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| I think we've had maybe one panel replaced out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| We used federal grant dollars, $2.1 million, to pay for that installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| There's 350 panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| At the time we did it, it was one of the largest in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| With a 25-year warranty on the panels and a 21-and-a-half-year lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| so we get to the sweet spot with the panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I'm a little worried about the inverters, that it takes two warranties to get them to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| What is the dollar value in inverters if we had to replace every inverter within 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| That's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| First off, there is no reason you should have to replace all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| But the system has been designed as string inverters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| so it will be a series of anywhere from probably 15 to 20 panels on one inverter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| That was done for reliability and redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| The nice thing about string inverters are they're not that expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| They're maybe $800 to $1,200, depending on how large they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| So you're not looking at a phenomenal expense to have those replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| As part of our contract, we're actually providing at least probably two extra string inverters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| So if there is a warranty situation, they can be switched out while it's returned for warranty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| But after 20 years, if there was, say, a 5% failure rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| it would not be a phenomenal cost to have those replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| We already have them in place at the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| Are you all just going to take over the operation of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| or are you going to take those out and put new ones in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| That's actually a separate contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Those are solar thermal panels, so they heat up hot water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| These are photovoltaic panels, so they're completely different in their intent and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| One thing I will point out about the question about the solar thermal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| solar thermal is actually a lot more fragile than photovoltaics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Photovoltaics are a lot more durable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| As you can imagine, the thermals have a lot of hot water tubes in them that can get damaged easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| and they've had tremendous durability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| so that should hopefully make everyone feel more comfortable about photovoltaic panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| Will you be putting additional units of yours out there then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| These will be completely separate, separate contracts, separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| These will provide electricity to the building when those are providing hot water to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| so completely separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Are those differentiated on this list, yours versus theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Yep, theirs are all inside the gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| Ours are all outside the gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Yours is a straight line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Let me double check the drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| It's on the west side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1683)|
| 0:28:12| Yep, if you look at the drawing in the back of your package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| ours are the ones that are in blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| and then the solar thermals are all the ones spread out inside the fence line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1697)|
| 0:28:28| It looks like to me, Brad, where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| No, the other ones are in the front by the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Top right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| They're a little difficult to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| They're actually not drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| They're actually from the photograph inside the fence line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| kind of where the light gray area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Kind of looks like a dog kennel or a dog run in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Yep, that's a good description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Right against the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| So they're spread all throughout, right against the solar thermals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| They're all throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| You said they're durable for a hailstorm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| What about golf balls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| Well, that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| They are durable for golf balls, and we actually reduce the amount that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| Ask them for a friend, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| That was one concern was actually people might actually target them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| but we reduce the amount on the northern exposure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| the northern part of the drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| and they're at a slant down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| So if anyone were to hit a golf ball at them, they should go right over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| They should absorb any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Yeah, I was just going to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| some of the other commissioners may not be aware that the ones going in for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| L&M, L&N STEM Academy are just for educational purposes only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| and you're not really generating any power per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Yeah, I mean, they'll produce electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| It'll be very nominal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| It's more for educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| We're doing a kiosk as part of that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| so it'll be a nice display in the front lobby so the kids can learn about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1792)|

| 0:31:15| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Does this make our parking spaces bigger or smaller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| We're on the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| I think we're on the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Are we on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| We're not on the parking space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Parking lot layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Yeah, it's going to be small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| I think it's going to be smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| What, where this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| This, well, has it, this was, came out of the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| the frustration because the city of Knoxville had one size for their parking stall measurements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| and the county had another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| So we're going to be reducing the parking stall size down to match up with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| So we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| But we were bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| We were bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| We'll now be matching the city of Knoxville so we're not putting any undue pressure on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| new businesses coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Or dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| We're already variancing most of those anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| That's the, you're getting rid of the variance process is what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| What we're trying to do is save the business community having to file a $200 fee and wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| 30 days and appear before the board just to have the same parking regulations as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| See, that's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Unless everybody starts driving smart cars, I don't like my doors dinged up when I pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| And you keep cutting these things down in size, you know, to 9 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Your vehicle is 7 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| They've been cut down for years on variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Very few build the 10 foot or 11 foot one anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| I haven't, I don't know that I've seen one in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| I think the only current person is Costco that did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| But every month on the BZA agenda there, somebody's asking reduce, reduce, reduce, reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| And I guess we'll have to start parking crossways and they're taking up two spaces to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| getting parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Could you please tickle him when he does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| The intent was to encourage the businesses to locate it in Knox County and not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| city of Knoxville, where they wouldn't have to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2002)|

| 0:35:34| 41, discussion regarding distribution of beer board fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| I think we talked a little bit about this last month and I think the funding for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| Metropolitan Drug Commission has gone down as most of the other contracted services with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| I kind of thought it would be something for us to discuss and entertain next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| The law director would like us to discuss it at the beer board next week, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| like to ask him to research if we could draft a resolution or an ordinance that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| us to designate 25% of the fines to the agency that is contracted through the mayor's contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2166)|
| 0:36:14| services to perform drug awareness or drug prevention for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| Didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| We talked about that about four or five years ago, but we never did follow through with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| But since we have raised the fines, I definitely think serving on that board, and I know some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| of you all have too, there's a great need and so many new problems or new drugs coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2192)|
| 0:36:41| out that the kids are getting into and all of this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| The education that we have to do now is very costly and time consuming, so any help that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2206)|
| 0:36:54| we can give them certainly may keep them out of Roger Wilson out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| Mr. Commissioner, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Yes, sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Would this cover the increase of the cost of the people who go out and check, Wolfie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| crew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Well, there's a discussion about that too, and I think the law director would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| look and see if that could be recovered on the criminal side as a matter of court cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| But I don't know if you can charge them, that would be research I guess, but I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| if you can charge them for the personnel, but for the product loss certainly you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| should be able to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| You got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| So we'll discuss that more at beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| How often do they conduct these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| I don't know that there's very few months that they haven't conducted them while I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| been on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Okay, I did notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Now, he hasn't done a three-day thing like that since we've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| If I'm not mistaken, I don't believe we have any violations coming up this month, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Well, one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| He got them all in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| One thing that hampers Wolfie somewhat is finding qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| Purchasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Purchasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| There's not very many people in the jail that are 18 to 20, so it's difficult for him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| get employees to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| He can only use them so many times, I mean, it becomes apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| But he does try to do at least one a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Sometimes he has done more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| But the last two months ago, they did a joint one, as you know, with the state, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| why we had the long list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| And also on your beer, or just a side note, on your beer applications this month, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| Bullfeathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| He was in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| I called the commission library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| He was in the process of changing hands prior to his sale, so this is not one of those under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| the slot of hand he is legitimately selling his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| It just happened to be that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2341)|

| 0:39:15| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Dwight, we appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2356)|

| 0:39:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Do you have one of these up in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| You know, you've got to teach them young to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| That might be one outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Zach Johnson is our recycling coordinator commissioner, and quite frankly, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| I suspect that he does, but we'll double check to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| Hey, just hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Commissioner Mulvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2386)|

| 0:39:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Well, I just want to remind everyone that Bob and I are going out to Thursday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| to Henry's Deli, Wednesday night, Henry's Deli in Gibbs for a meet and greet from 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| until 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| We'd love for you guys to come join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Commissioner Mulvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I use the facility, Dwight, I use the facility out at Dutchtown quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2411)|
| 0:40:20| And a lot of recycling and a lot of trash that I try to get rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| There were some changes made, I guess, the last time I went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| And I just want to know the reasoning behind it, I guess, that your trailer has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| can't be over, the trash can't be above it or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| A lot of these trailers, like mine especially, is only that deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| So if you don't, I mean, there's no way to, you can only make one trip a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| So what was the reasoning behind doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| One of the things that we fight at the centers, and it's very difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| it is a problem for center operators everywhere, is those of you that have big centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| and this is really going to be everybody but Commissioner Wright, know there is one box on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Oh, that was a jab right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| And we are working on getting him a better situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Just stand right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| But everybody has a bulky or C&D box, construction and demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| and that is for that weekend when Commissioner Smith is remodeling a bathroom at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| and he has a few panels of sheetrock and maybe an old commode to throw away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| That is landfilled separately than conventional garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| We treat it separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| It's actually a little bit less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| But one of the biggest challenges we have with the centers is like commercial operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| will attempt to use our facilities rather than using commercial facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| and that way they avoid the tipping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| It's a problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| They fill the boxes up faster than they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Competitively, they get an unfair advantage over folks that are in the same business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| that are doing what they're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| which is going to commercial landfills and paying the tipping fee and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| And we fight that pretty much every day at every center that has a C&D box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| So that is one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Another thing that we run into occasionally, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| is small cottage industries where people will set themselves up as unlicensed private waste haulers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| where a guy has a trailer and he may canvas eight or ten of his neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| and say, listen, for five bucks a week I'll haul all your garbage to the convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| And while that sounds good, it is a commercial operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| That is not how the centers are intended to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| They're for individual families and individual constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| But that is a real-life example that came to light when a lady called Tom Salter one morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| to say that her trash hadn't been picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| And Tom did a little investigation to find out what had happened and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| So that's probably the reason for the trailer limitation that you're seeing at Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| I mean, it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| I mean, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Just when I went out there one day, they're like, you can't drop this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| I went, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I didn't know nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Well, that's a good explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| But all your centers work smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| I have no issue with any staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| You all do wonderful jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I just would brag on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| I will tell you that it's a little-known fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| but that the convenience centers touch more individual constituents on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| than any other department of Knox County government except the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| They touch an awful lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| And so things go really, really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| And I appreciate the work that Tom and Drew Thurman and Zach Johnson and the staff do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| So, Jeff, whenever you take your mattress outside, you've got to lay it down in the trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| Apparently I'm going to the city and paying the fee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Is there anything else before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Is there anybody in the public that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| Nobody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Well, on Item 43, we have a couple people here that just wanted to brief us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| before we vote next week just so we could kind of be thinking about it for the next eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| If you want to give them five minutes to speak on Item 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Do you guys want to make just a quick presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| I think you sent an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| I was at a couple of community meetings this past month, and one of them was community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| And this was a big topic of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| Did you guys want to say anything or wait until next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Because this is your five minutes of fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Well, you can have five minutes next week, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| I know Larry wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| You have received the material that what we're asking for is to amend the proposed Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2684)|
| 0:44:55| I wasn't sure how your procedure works, whether you had to deal with that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| or not deal with it until next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| You did receive material from community forum, at least already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| just explaining what our rationale is for that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| If it's city, wouldn't that not go to the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| We still, both of us, vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Still inside the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Both of us vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| I've been seven years trying to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Part of it is outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| Part of it is outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Yeah, part of it is outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| But we vote on both city and county plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| I'm happy to answer any questions that you have, but that was the gist of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| what needs to be done is requesting an amendment as to what's proposed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| Do you have a copy of your amendment, proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| It's in your material, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| That's in an email also earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| It was perplexing, too, because the MPC Commission voted, the commissioners voted seven to seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| on removing some of the language in this, and that's why they're so concerned about it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| So it was a split vote at the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Has the city already voted on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Mr. Welch says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| The city voted on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| They have two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| And they made the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| They made an amendment, which was a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| The amendment we're asking for and that we asked city council for was to delete the language dealing with Plan ET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2797)|
| 0:46:46| And the reason, there are three basic reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| One is to keep clear that Plan ET, which they now say is not a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| but that Plan ET and its products is separate from and different from the comprehensive plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2817)|
| 0:47:05| that are adopted by this body and MPC and which are mandated by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| and which must be followed by law for every land use decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| So we see those comprehensive plans like the sector plans, the general plan, the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| as mandated by state law as being very separate from Plan ET, which was a three-year visioning dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| It's now being called by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| The second reason is the process is very different for Plan ET than it is for the comprehensive plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| Plan ET, unlike the comprehensive plans, has never been adopted by anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| All of the comprehensive plans, the sector plans, as you well know, the general plan, the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| are adopted by MPC and by city council and by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| So on the one hand, and you have a legal framework that says what these plans are about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| the extent of these plans, what they deal with, and that they are mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and binding for every land use decision, every zoning decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| That's very different from Plan ET, which is not legally mandated, cannot be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| There is no legal process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| There's never been an adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Also, Plan ET involved five counties as opposed to our single county comprehensive plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2897)|
| 0:48:25| Our comprehensive plans are actually Knoxville and Knox County minus Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| The third reason is MPC itself, in its April 2nd clarification memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| says that you can remove all references to Plan ET without changing the intent and the meaning or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| of the Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| And for those reasons, what we're trying to do is avoid confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| When developers and neighborhood groups come down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| we all want to be talking about whether or not a decision follows the same plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| We don't want somebody bringing in some other plan that has not gone through the adoption process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| of all of the comprehensive plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| So that is only the entirety of our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Commissioner Schimel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| We all three have to pass the exact same plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| You don't have to, Jeff Welch, Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| I mean, what is in there is just you'd have two different plans out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| which there's no argument about anything in the plan, any of the concepts, the land uses, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| It was just referencing Plan East Tennessee in the document that was interpreted one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| and was not meant to be interpreted a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| The language that City Council and through MPC offered up basically states that Plan East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| and its products are not part or incorporated into the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| and its sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| It was language that the neighborhood groups, community forum all agreed with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| and the City Council agreed with that language that we added to the adopted city sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| And that is language that we are comfortable with as staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| The commissioner would have been comfortable with that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| So I think we have reached a respectable solution to the issue of how we utilize and reference Plan AT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| John, are you going to bring that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| You're going to bring that amendment Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| We distributed it as part of the packet to you, so it's working with these groups here and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| We are comfortable with the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Just to be clear that there's no confusion, we accepted the proposed language at City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| which was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| However, we are still asking this body to delete all references to Plan AT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| which is exactly what we had asked the City Council to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| but we ended up with a compromised position that we could live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| and we really prefer, for all the reasons we've stated in our information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| we really prefer all references to Plan AT be deleted from this document, the Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| I mean, I guess my question, I understand you prefer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| but to the point that we would actually have two differing documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| You said you accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| You're okay with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| I mean, there's never a 100% kind of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I would just hate to have two separate documents on something that you could have lived with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| but I've got 100% here and I've got 95% here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| so I'm just trying to get a gauge for you saying that we accepted the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| To me, compromise is kind of what this whole thing is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| So are you truly in a position of compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| We prefer, we strongly prefer that there be no references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| At City Council, frankly, there was differences of opinion with the city administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| and we took a compromise that we could live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| We think we've addressed a major concern, but we still think it's just better not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| I'm told that a different situation was like with the ridgetop and hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| Yeah, and that's a big mess too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Where we have a different thing in the city versus the county, but we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| That was an example of an occasion not too long ago where we ended up with different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| So I would just say to this body, it is still a mess, but at least that was for reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| whether you agree with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| I mean, this to me seems, I would just hate to have two documents based on something that both sides could live with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| and that particular one, the prevailing side could not live with the verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| so that's why they got the Briggs Amendment put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| This seems different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| So we'll talk about it again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| The city has a second reading on it too, but if we vote unanimously to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| But it sounds like there's something, again, that they couldn't live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| There was an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| We'll do our due diligence this week and come back next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| We'll be happy to answer any questions next week or between now and then if you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| I know it is a technical issue, and it is somewhat confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| but we'll be happy to come back next week, or if you have any questions before that, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| It doesn't sound too confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| You want no references, and they have references, and you want your way, and they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| So it's not confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| I just want to make sure we've got all the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Mr. Welch, you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| You good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| I may regret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Again, we can address it next week, but it will create, you know, again, Plan E.T. was used as a reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| As we use resources throughout, all of our documents use resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| It does not refer to Plan E.T. as a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| We deleted that word terminology out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| In good faith, I came down here expecting that, you know, with the folks that came to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| They offered up the language to utilize for this, and, you know, in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| I thought we were coming to the table here today with a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| And quite honestly, I don't see that good faith coming here today with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| We'll work through it Monday or Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Anything else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Just to remind everybody of the meeting time change for Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| You mean there's a time change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| And we have had excellent attendance at our evening meetings, by the way, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Next week we will kind of revert back to our old schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| We'll have an 1130 lunch, and then that will be a budget discussion for us and Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| Chris will be there, available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| It's also on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3314)|

| 0:55:21| two o'clock commission meeting, and five o'clock zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3321)|

| 0:55:36| Thursday night, six o'clock, with the school board at the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| The meal will be provided, and we will get that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| So, and you can, I wouldn't park on Gage, don't park on Gage Street, because that's two-hour parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| Do we have enough room for the night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| A room for the night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Do we have the room for that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| So, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS150518?start=3358)|
