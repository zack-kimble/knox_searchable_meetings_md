| 0:01:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| I'll move to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=97)|
| 0:01:44| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Yes, Mr. Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| I'd like to withdraw the resolution that I proposed, 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| And what I'd like to say, I'd like to make a comment about that, is that I want to make sure that the intent of the resolution is really understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=114)|
| 0:02:03| It seems like things have gotten a little bit out of hand with what my intentions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| First of all, I think all of us are supportive of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| I think we're also supportive of our downtown area and what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| And basically what this resolution was or is, it really is a request and urges both you, Mr. Mayor, and the administration to carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=136)|
| 0:02:27| and seriously consider the possibility of additional funding to the neighborhoods for such things as the greenway expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| sidewalk repairs, additional pavings, planting and maintaining trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| also helping with code compliance in certain projects in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| It was not my intention to go around the way in terms of which budgets are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| It was just a matter of urging you and your staff to consider these things and consider the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| And also at the same time, we had talked about once before that if, in fact, we do the garage, the State Street parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=178)|
| 0:03:06| add the additional floor and repair the structure, that if it makes sense at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| and if we have the money to go ahead and add the additional two floors to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| So, again, I'd like to go ahead and withdraw this, but I'd also like to have you definitely consider what the intent of the resolution was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=196)|
| 0:03:26| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| I withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| I have a comment, Mr. Mayor, but I want to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| We'll wait until you return, Councilman DelaVault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| Mayor, let me also say while we're waiting for him that this was not meant to be any kind of a pork barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| That was called to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| It was also not meant to be a slush fund or anything for the individual council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| It was actually meant to increase what we're already doing in the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| but again to highlight the neighborhoods and let them know that we're interested in what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| I'm sure you had the best of intentions with your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| I have returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| I wanted to ask that we remove, that we withdraw 11W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| Yes, we need to motion on Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| Oh, yes, we need a second on his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| I'll second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| All right, Councilman DelaVault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Item 11M, let me get this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| 11M has to do with a request to approve an agreement with a contractor to provide mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| and landscaping services on the state highway medians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| There are several of these kinds of issues on our agenda, but 11M is being withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| Apparently there was a bid error and a request to withdraw the bid, and it has been allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| I am moving that we withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Later I will ask that we add a substitute provision that awards or asks to award the contract to the second lowest bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=318)|
| 0:05:28| and we'll arrive at that when you get to motions to add, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| But that will be 11V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| Are you speaking of 11M?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| 11M is to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| As in Maryland, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Are there any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Yes, sir, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I'd like to postpone 12A for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| As you know, we have a workshop scheduled for April the 28th on the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| so I think it's prudent we just postpone it for eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| It's been moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| I would like to make a motion to add 11U to the agenda, and I will let Mr. Swanson give the specifics behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=396)|
| 0:06:49| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| 11U is a resolution that would provide for city council to apply for an H1 overlay for the property related to Old South Knox High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=411)|
| 0:07:03| And as you read the code, it's arguable that a single council member could make that application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| but it is also arguable that if city council is to initiate such an application, it must be the entire city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| So rather than run upon that as a problem related to that, it seemed better, as I have said in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| to wear suspenders and a belt and be very careful and do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| And so at Councilman Pavlis' request, I have prepared a resolution that would be a resolution of the council authorizing that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=449)|
| 0:07:38| It would only call for the consideration of whether or not H1 is overlay from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| It would not actually apply an H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| You are not in a position to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| It first has to go to MPC, and MPC will recommend to you, after it goes through the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=470)|
| 0:07:58| you will get the recommendation as to whether or not it should have an H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| And it would take all nine members of council to add it to the agenda this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| and then we would hear the, you know, deal with it in its natural order in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| So I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| Has there been a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Let me go to Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| No, my light was to add another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| No, it's a new light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| We'll vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Now, Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| This is the second part of the puzzle I mentioned earlier, and that is that item, I move that we add item 11W, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=519)|
| 0:08:49| No, V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| 11V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| And it is a request to approve the contract to the second lowest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| There were four bidders on this particular mowing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| As I indicated, the one that's been withdrawn was a bidder who has backed out of the bid because of an error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| and the effort is to award it to the next lowest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=547)|

| 0:09:56| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Under the mayor's report, I have a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| We are pleased to have several members of the Neighborhood Advisory Council here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| Some are being reappointed, and others are new appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Please stand, those of you who are being reappointed or new appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| so that we can thank you for your service to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| And let's give them a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| Any of you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| If not, we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Also, let me mention we have a sister city in Japan, Maruron, Japan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=638)|
| 0:10:49| and we have checked with them, and they have not suffered too much damage with the tsunami.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=649)|
| 0:10:58| So we are thankful that they are all right, and we wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| Also, there are some recycling public meetings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| The city will be hosting a series of public meetings on that, on recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| on March the 24th at 7 p.m. at Dogwood Elementary School, on the 28th, Fountain City Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=675)|

| 0:11:33| and also March the 31st will be at the Burlington Library on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| So that will be information on the recycling program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| And then the Third Creek Greenway cleanup is scheduled for March 26th, March 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=702)|
| 0:11:52| And the Knox County CAC AmeriCorps is hosting that cleanup from noon until 3 p.m. on Saturday, March the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=712)|
| 0:12:04| If you want to volunteer, you should meet at Tyson Park at noon at the Lodge Pavilion near the restrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| to sign in and receive information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| All tools will be provided and volunteers should wear appropriate clothing for work and bring a bottle of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| That is all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| Reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| No, Mr. Mayor, I have a question on the Third Creek bike trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Do we have any idea when the bridge is going to be replaced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Mr. King, would you have information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Mr. Brace has the most current information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| but I know he has been working hard with purchasing to get a crane set up to come and lift the bridge back in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| David can give you more information, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| David Brace, 2150 Maplewood, City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| We actually mobilized a crane there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| We had to wait for the ground to dry out, so hopefully that bridge will get placed between now and the end of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| We're supposed to get more rain tomorrow, so that may stave it off another couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| But the goal, obviously, is the April 3rd marathon route, which I'll be running a section of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| But April 3rd is the goal, hopefully by this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Yes, Mayor, we have a workshop scheduled for April 14th here in the large assembly room at 5 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| on the community development action plan and the community and the public is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=814)|
| 0:13:43| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| I have two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Number one, I'd just like to inform everyone that I'm having my quarterly coffee with the councilmen this Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| from 9 to 11 at the Roundup Restaurant in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| Of course, anyone is invited, but particularly my constituents in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| And I also have a very special guest here with me this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| I have Mr. Caleb Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| He is a sixth grader at Gresham Middle School, and he was elected to a city council position there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| And he had me out about three weeks ago to shadow him, so I invited him this evening to come shadow us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| So just welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Caleb, why don't you stand and let's give you a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=862)|
| 0:14:32| Maybe a future councilman, future mayor, future governor, future president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| We're glad to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Don't see any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| We have also the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| Yes, you can read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| 7A is an annual report for the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| Is anyone here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Mr. Mayor, members of the council, I'm Bill Cole at 6508 Sherwood Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and I'm the current chairman of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| I'd like to have a copy before you of the annual report for 2010 of the Police Advisory and Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=914)|
| 0:15:21| And it's our privilege to present this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| I'd like to introduce a couple of members of the committee and also the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| Ola Blackman-McBride is the vice chairman, and Reverend John Butler is another member of PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| And also our staff, our executive director, Avis Reed, and her executive assistant, Lisa Chambers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| And they all do a fine job, and there's a couple of other members that aren't here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| Also, Commissioner Hank Strickland is not here due to death in his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| but our staff and our committee is very committed and does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| Now, PARC, as you know, the purpose of it is, to be very short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| is to improve the relationship between the Knoxville Police Department and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| And I think if you look at the statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| there's a letter in there that shows some statistical information from 2005 through 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| and there's a continuous reduction in the number of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| and disciplinary matters that are reviewed by PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| And although we would love to have no complaints at all from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| I think the reduction in the number of complaints is significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| as is the fact that, again, this year, although any complaint is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| there were no serious major incidents that were reviewed by Internal Affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| and which PARC reviewed which constituted a serious incident between the community and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1007)|
| 0:16:59| And I'd also just like to express our appreciation and continued appreciation, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| to Avis Reed for her work with the command staff in Internal Affairs at the police department, and Lisa as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1026)|
| 0:17:15| and also the cooperation of the command staff at Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| and the commitment and diligence of the Internal Affairs investigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| It's been a pleasure to be on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Mr. Cole, I just want to thank you and your committee for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| You know, we have a ñ I think we're blessed in this city in that we have a very professional police force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| and we all hope that each and every day that they work harder to work with the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| and vice versa, that the communities work harder with our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| This is a partnership, and our city will be safer and healthier if citizens are working with the police to solve crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| And I think your committee does a great job in airing complaints where that relationship doesn't work great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| So I thank you for your service and your committee's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Councilwoman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| Yeah, I just wanted to echo my colleague's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Congratulations to Chief Owen and the department and to Mr. Cole and the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| and Ms. Reed for the excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| When we look at this report and see the reduction in the number of citizen complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| as this report says, this shows the continued improvement in relations between our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| and our police department, and we're all pleased with that and proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1120)|

| 0:21:08| So those of you that are on the committee, look for that e-mail and hopefully get back to Cindy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1268)|

| 0:22:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| I didn't see your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Yeah, I've got some handout here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| I'd like to circulate for just a little bit further discussion on this issue if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Are we reconsidering the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1336)|
| 0:22:37| Do you have a handout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| If I understand this right, I just want to make sure that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1362)|
| 0:23:05| And if you look at the one long sheet there, this would be, and correct me if I'm wrong about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| but these would be the dates that we would be, as a candidate, would be reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| And, for example, there would be a statement due the 11th to the city, excuse me, the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1399)|
| 0:23:32| It would be closed out March 31st, but due to the city the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| And due the same report to the state the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| And as you go down that list, you see the duplicative efforts here that I really don't think are necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1421)|
| 0:23:50| to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And if you'll look at the second sheet, it would highlight, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| so, in other words, we would report, the candidates would report one report on the 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1439)|
| 0:24:07| which would be the date due for the state, the state report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| So why would we not mirror the ones that are due for the state rather than duplicate, you know, four days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1452)|
| 0:24:22| we're reporting to the city first and then the state four days later pretty much are exactly the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1462)|
| 0:24:31| So it seems to me like this would be a lot of work that really a candidate would not have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| And I don't know that I read that right, but I believe that that is how this would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| Are we finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Let me recognize Council Member Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Is Greg McKay here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Yes, he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Greg, could you step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| While he's coming, we talked about this and the very issue that you raised, Councilman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| and the idea was that the reporting period ending is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| so there's no difference in reporting the ending of the donation acceptance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| And the idea was to have a common date each month that the city reports had to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| so that we didn't have some of the confusion that we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| Mr. McKay, could you help me out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| The way the ordinance is written now, you are required to file monthly after you've filed your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| And that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| And you also have the state requirements, so I understand there is some duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| The reports aren't the same, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| The state requirement is much less stringent than the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| The city's really a model for openness and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| It requires every dollar spent and every dollar taken in to be reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| The state report only requires those contributions over $100 to be itemized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| So they're not the same report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| We have sat and tried to figure out, you know, the best way to do this to avoid duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| I'm not sure exactly what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| I mean, the point is I think the public, you know, it's not up to me to determine policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| I'm just the clerk that keeps track of the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| But the system you have now in place seems to work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| It does require that every 30 days that you fill out a report saying who gave you money and what you did with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| And what we wanted to change was the way you read the law now, it almost sounds as if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1589)|
| 0:26:38| well, it doesn't almost sound, the law department has told us that every candidate has a unique filing date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| based upon when you filed your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| If you filed your petition on the 15th, then your report is due on the 15th of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| If the guy running next to you filed on the 12th, his report is due on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| So we just wanted to find a way to make the report due for everybody at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| And, of course, you know, the devil's in the details of how you do that without causing you to fill out paperwork twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| But, really, you only have to fill out three state reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| So, you know, what you're saying is you're going to have to fill out three extra reports, on the one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| balancing the public knowing exactly what you spent your money on, on the other hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| So I'll let you guys figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| Well, the city report is more detailed, and I don't have any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| It just seems like that it would make more sense to have one consistent date that we file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| And I don't know that we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| And like I say, I'm not sure that I'm reading it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| but I think I am that there would be a report due to the city report would be due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| and then four days later the state report would be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Well, it is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| It's not would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| We're not advocating that you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| That's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Well, again, if you look at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| There is some double reportage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| So, I mean, I just don't know why we would want to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Why would we want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| I mean, we talked about that during the election because it was not clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| and I like the point that we get to where it's one date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| That's what our goal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| The city and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| And I understand that the city's reporting requirements are different, and I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| And that's just a slight adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| It's just the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| State due dates in some cases are four, five, six days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| but there's nothing that says you have to wait until the deadline date to file the state report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| so you could, in fact, file both at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Obviously, there's more frequency of the city reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and so that in itself is a burden if that's how we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| But, essentially, the same information is there, and there's no reason why you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| If I were the candidate, I'd go ahead and file the state report at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| and then I'd have it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I can't speak for every candidate, but that was the thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Yeah, well, we have Greg McKay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Greg, my memory, if it serves me correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| was that the city hadn't prescribed a particular form you have to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| whereas the state has its own form that you have to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| And my memory was that your office will accept any report that has the key information the city is looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| the name of the party, the amount of the donation, the date, where they work, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| And so I suppose you could file the state report with the city with an addendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| adding the additional items, the donors under $100 or expenses under $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| Would that be fair as far as your office is concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| I think that's accurate, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| So you could prepare one major report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| and then have a supplement for whatever was left out for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| and put it in at the same time if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| And a lot of people do full disclosure on their state reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Just get it done once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I understood Nick's concern was do we have too many reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| I mean, that seems to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Well, you can eliminate about four to five reports, depending on if you made it to the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| But, I mean, you see the other schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| I mean, it just seems like it would just be more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| And I can understand it or, you know, see it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| But I just think that it would be more fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| That's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Well, I mean, it might be worth looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I guess the one advantage the city report adds is that it tends to disclose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| whether there's going to be a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| because it gives the person's occupation or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So voters can look at that city report and say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| I'm concerned or not concerned that this person seems to be engaged in this industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| or has a lot of supporters there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| So it's useful information to voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Whether they use it or not is up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Yeah, I think the state model requires if it's over $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Over $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| They cut off the minor donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| And, of course, in city elections, maybe most of them are minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| So under that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| This question is for Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| A moment ago you referenced that the state requires three reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| The pre-primary and the pre-general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Well, I may be wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Well, this shows quarterly reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| And I thought that the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Yeah, it depends, I guess, on when you begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| I thought the state only required reports at year-end and mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| Not in the year of the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| The year of the election, then they come quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| And then there's a post-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Ten days before the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| So there's definitely overlap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| There is some overlap, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| I mean, it's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| It just seems to me that if we're wanting to have consistency and be more fluid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| that this would be a method for us to get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| Councilman Della Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Well, let me ask Councilman Pavlis, would you prefer that we postpone this for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and take a look at if there's any way to shorten the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| I mean, what the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| As Greg said, you know, the policy question was built into the city charter, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| in terms of what you'd ---- or statute ordinances, what you have to disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| And so, but since we're the policymakers, we could change that, if you thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| simplifying it made running easier for the average candidate or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| There's other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| It would be interesting to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| With this new information right here provided by Councilman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| I personally wouldn't mind having a little more time to have a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| If we can streamline this process a little bit more to eliminate some duplicative filing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| I would like to give us an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| I don't know that we can, but we've got some new information here that shows that we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| could streamline it a little bit more, starting with Councilperson Palmer's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| So, personally, I wouldn't mind having a little more time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Well, I am a little bit concerned that we're closing in as more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| and more people are announcing for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| I think we need to get the rules straight early on so people understand about the reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| And there's really no more reporting volume of reports than there have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2018)|
| 0:33:47| It just simply clarifies when they need to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| So I'm not real clear on the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Well, I mean, the folks are just ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And I agree, more people are getting in and what have you, but it was just now March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| So, you know, I don't know that it ---- I mean, I'll make a motion to postpone it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| and let folks digest this and let it come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| And, you know, if it doesn't, if it's not the council's pleasure, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| But I think it's worth looking at anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| So I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Is that a ---- we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| Are you making a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| When is the next meeting that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Is it before this 4-11 date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| It is before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| It's the fifth, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| I'll second the motion so we can see if we have any interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Councilman, just to clarify, do you want to state your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| I just moved to postpone this measure for two weeks to where we can look at this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2098)|
| 0:35:06| and just come back and deal with it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| I think that still gives us plenty of time for, even though there's a lot of announced candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| but I think there's still plenty of time, particularly our next meeting will be before the first filing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| And I have no desire to throw any wrench in anybody's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| I don't have anything that I'm promoting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| but I would tell you that if you come back in two weeks and you make substantive changes in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| it will be as if you're on first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| So if you wanted it to pass in two weeks, then you'd have to amend it to emergency when you amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| There's a way to do it, but you just have to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Well, Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| So, Councilman Pavlis, you'll probably just, within the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| consult with those that you think maybe could provide additional information and come up with some new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2155)|
| 0:36:04| Well, I mean, you know, what I've given you tonight is the way that I read the resolution as it's being presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| So all I would be asking is that, you know, council consider this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| and if they thought it was worth, you know, the effort, then we'll deal with it in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| and if not, then you can just vote my measure down tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| I just think it's worth looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Just so I understand, you gave us two sheets of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| The proposed one is the shorter sort of chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Do I read it correctly that some monthly reports are, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| eliminated because you defer to the state report so that we wouldn't have consecutive monthly city reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| We would only have them in time periods where there wasn't a state report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Yeah, you could just submit the state report, but with the city, you do have to go from ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| That's the only difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Again, it's just the consistency of the date that you report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I wonder if Ms. Poplin wouldn't mind sending us an e-mail with whatever requirements we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| so we can compare them to this idea, since the time is short, if you would e-mail us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| What your current requirements are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2239)|

| 0:42:21| We had an agreement on this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| There was a problem created by the Kroger's development for the access to my client's property on the south side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2544)|
| 0:42:34| Kingston Pike opposite the Kroger development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2554)|

| 0:43:06| and getting all of the site plans engineered down and so forth, what we need here tonight is a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2586)|

| 0:43:20| what we need is a motion that Condition 16 is added as an additional condition to the use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2600)|
| 0:43:29| What happened was that MPC, the staff, and that MPC action, they imposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| they approved that use-on-review subject to 15 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2614)|

| 0:44:03| until such time as this described relocated access has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| And that condition with the attached documents, the letter and drawing, have been supplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2647)|
| 0:44:13| As I say, the way to accomplish this is to have a motion to approve the use-on-review subject to now 16 conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2653)|
| 0:44:22| as per MPC approval and in accordance with the submitted material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| What you end up with is a use-on-review approved for the Kroger development with 16 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| The parties have agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| I don't know whether Mr. Kirby is here as representative of Kroger or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| I was told he might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Yes, he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| A series of e-mails, telephone conversations, and communication have indicated all parties are in approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| I ask that there be a motion to approve the use-on-review with 16 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Yes, if I could ask either Mr. Swanson or Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| Of course, let me start by saying we're pleased that you resolved your dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| We think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| My question is, can we add a condition without MPC looking at it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| This is really in keeping with what they were trying to do in terms of protecting the traffic flow in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| so that it wouldn't be disruptive, and a lot of the conditions go to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| This is one more effort in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| but I don't know what ground we're standing on in terms of where this has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| It would appear to me to be fair to say that the MPC fairly looked at the issue of ingress and egress from that establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| and, frankly, you're not moving the point of ingress and egress for this particular applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| You're really moving the one on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| and so I do not perceive any need to go back to MPC with regard to that unless you feel differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2747)|
| 0:45:57| No, I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| As an appeal, the council gets to consider the use-on-review and development plan de novo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| starting with the information that you've got in your packets, and you are free to go wherever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you both for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| I'll make the motion that we, I guess, resolve the appeal by adding condition number 16 to the 15 already suggested by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2773)|
| 0:46:24| Essentially, that's a motion to approve the use-on-review subject to 16 conditions, the 15 previously indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| as well as the new 16th condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| That's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Before I second that, I would like to hear, not that I dispute Mr. King, but I would like to hear from Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| Chris Kirby, Wilbur Smith Associates, 1100 Marion Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| Good evening, Honorable Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| It's my pleasure to announce that we are in agreement and that we have worked out our differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| We appreciate everyone's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I'd like to commend the City of Knoxville staff, the State Department of Transportation, and everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| And we're very excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| I hope all of you are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| And Kroger Co. has a reputation of doing things the right way, and my clients are very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| and eager to get the project underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| So with that, if anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Thank you. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| This keeps that project moving along without any delays while we work out all the little details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| And this was a way to accomplish this, and I appreciate the action of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| 11A is a resolution authorizing the establishment of a pension task force to be selected by and reporting to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2870)|
| 0:47:59| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| I just wanted to understand, do we know at this point how many members are going to be on this, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| newly set forth task force, or is that to be determined with the authorization that we're giving here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| I think it is to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| And the second question, I guess, would be, is my understanding correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Maybe this is for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Whatever this task force does, it reports its findings and or recommendations to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| but council remains free to adopt or disregard or do whatever it needs to do at the time of the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| This is just a task force which investigates issues related to the pension plan and its sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| It reports its findings, recommendations, if any, to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| And then at that point, it's entirely up to the council to decide what to do with the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| and recommendations of the task force when it comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Appreciate that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| It says in the resolution that the membership and the designated chair of the proposed task force shall be nominated by the Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| Joe Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| I wanted to ask you, Joe, is it your intention to remain with many of the members who were on the previous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| Well, I didn't turn my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I didn't know if we had any speakers, but I was going to, if the resolution passes, speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| But my intention is to work with you, the council, through Mr. Swanson and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| And the first thing I would do is I would recommend a chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| and then I would recommend to have an outline in the framework of what the committee should look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| and then work with you on who should sit and serve on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| So I think it's going to be a joint effort, including diversity in the employees' groups, the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2986)|
| 0:49:55| individuals with knowledge and expertise on the subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| So prior to if this does pass, that's within the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| I should hope to have an outline and framework back to council to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Just a question, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Would it be appropriate for you to go ahead and do that before we approve this so that we do know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| My understanding is if the resolution passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| then I would be the one nominated to put the chairman, to name the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| and then to work with you and to consult with you on the membership and the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3026)|
| 0:50:36| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| I would just say that perhaps it makes it cleaner, I think, to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| would it be a substantive change if we included that language in this to where what Vice Mayor Bailey just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3042)|
| 0:50:52| I mean, what his intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Let's ask Mr. Swanson to get your thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| I'm not sure what that language is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| I think he has expressed to you how he intends to go about the job that's presented to him by this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| And I don't know that including that wording, additional wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| that he just said into this resolution would make a substantive difference one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| I mean, what you're doing is you're saying we are charging our Vice Mayor with the responsibility to put together an outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3080)|
| 0:51:28| or framework for this and to make nominations to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| Now, how he goes about determining who he's going to nominate to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| certainly you've turned that responsibility over to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| But if you don't like his nominations, you can turn them down when they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| You don't have to accept his nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Vice Mayor Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute change order number four to contract number C070139 with Vaughn & Melton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| Inc., for the First Creek Channel Improvements Project, Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| to increase the contract price by $25,000 for a new contract total of $416,365| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| and to extend the completion date to August 31, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Yes, I think this is for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| In reading through this, it's my understanding, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| that the cost of this project is now double the original estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| Did I misread, miscalculate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| Are you referring to the construction or this change order is for the engineering consultant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Volunteer Excavating LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| for construction services for the Lake Avenue Drainage Improvements Project in an amount not to exceed $282,378.14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| I was just going to add sort of a footnote to the information we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| I happened to see Mr. King today, and it talked about Volunteer Excavating being the low responsive bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| but we didn't get that traditional summary of bid sheet that we normally ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| And I did get a copy of it and looked it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| and interestingly enough Volunteer Excavating is much lower than the other two bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3226)|
| 0:53:52| I mean, the second highest bid or second lowest bid is almost twice as high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| So it truly is the low bidder, and I just wanted to point that fact out on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3237)|

| 0:57:43| Yes, I wonder if we still have Mr. Brace here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| I don't know the answer to this, but I think it's worth having someone tell us and tell the members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| What we're doing here is subcontracting out work that is more efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| or less expensively done by a private contractor rather than doing it with the city's forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| Yes, David Brace, 2150 Maplewood City Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| We have a number of mowing contracts, landscaping contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| Instead of adding capacity on our staffing levels, we've outsourced that to a private contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| We do that on these scattered sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| These are small sites throughout the city, pretty challenging locations to get to, small parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| We've done that with scattered sites, state highway medians, think of Middlebrook Pike, Broadway, Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3506)|
| 0:58:35| those areas, actually local medians, North Hills, Cherokee Boulevard, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| And that's been a way for us to add capacity without staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| I just wanted to thank you for working to try to keep the budget sound by looking for the lowest cost alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| These were done a long time ago before me, so I think Mr. Wetzel, we used to receive a lot of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| Thank Bob, he's in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| But we're glad to carry the torch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| Yes, I also want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| But, David, I noticed in the contract that you say that mowing needs to be every 14 days or two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| Who monitors that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Do you folks go out and make sure that's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| I'm sure you hear from the citizens, but how is that done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Yeah, 14 days is our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| And we have a horticulture manager, Alan Graham, and we have foremen out in the field who do the monitoring of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| I ultimately sign off on the invoices, but they're out in the field every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| We get complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Fourteen days kind of gets us to the point where it's pretty tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| So when they don't get mowed, we have regular neighbors that give us a shout and let us know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| I know most of them by first name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| The information system does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| It works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3591)|

| 1:00:08| And I want to make note tonight is the last night for Chief Owen, who has done such an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| I think we recognized him at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| But since this is his last night at this council meeting, I think we can pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| and at least give him a round of applause and thank him for all he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3627)|

| 1:01:48| to be used for the purchase of supplies for the Knoxville Fire Department's Learn Not to Burn Program to educate children about fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Yes, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I wonder if either the chief or perhaps Mr. Faddis or someone would just tell us a moment's worth of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| and, of course, appreciate the effort of the Fire Protection Association to sponsor that educational aspect to young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3726)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Kevin Faddis, 1031 Giuseppe Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| I'm the association president here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| The Learn Not to Burn Program, I was actually going to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| I know I see Nick at the gym every now and then and talk to him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| But Learn Not to Burn is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| Over the last three years, our association has donated over $38,000 in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3760)|
| 1:02:51| That's 25,000 preschool-age children that we've actually taught the Learn Not to Burn Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3771)|
| 1:02:59| With those monies, and let me state, like you said, this year was $13,000, a little over $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| With the cooperation of the chief and city council, you know, we're pleased to donate that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| It's a good program and it helps tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| It teaches kids what to do in case of emergency, a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| You know, with that money, we also provide them with information booklets, T-shirts, pens, magnets, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3802)|
| 1:03:35| I also want to state, and this didn't come out, but I did want to make this a point to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| Not only do we do this for the school children, but last month, February 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3822)|
| 1:03:49| I think you all remember the tragic fire at East Town Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| Our association also is community-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| Our association gave $6,500 to the burnout victims of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| Like I said, not only do we use this program to teach, but we're also community-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| You know, we are a part of the community as well as the police department and the other general services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| So I'm looking forward to keep donating as long as the city will take our money to fund this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3859)|
| 1:04:27| Looking forward to next year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| If you guys have any questions for me, I'd be willing to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| Councilman Delgado?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| No, I just wanted to thank the firemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| There are times when we criticize folks in this city for what they do or don't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| but you see them out there when there's a flood helping folks get across the road or go around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| You see them in neighborhoods when the first responders come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| and they help people who are in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| And this idea of learning how to avoid fires, learning how to survive fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| and you can picture a kid possibly stepping up and saving lives and his family with the knowledge they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3901)|
| 1:05:09| So this is one of those programs that's just great, and I thank them for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| Yes, I also want to thank the Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| It's a very positive thing, and thank you for all that you do in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| You'll be having a, I don't want to call it a program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| but you might want to announce the time and date for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Thursday morning at 10 a.m. we will be doing a check presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| It's going to be a large check at the 614 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| It's our association hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| It's right across from Mr. Greaves' business, so we can just skip right over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| The mayor, you're invited, and, of course, I think you've committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| Chief Sharp will be there, and I believe Deputy Chief Byrd will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| And actually our Captain Paul, heck, I escaped my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3962)|
| 1:06:10| Trompore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Trompore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| That's horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Paul Trompore will be there, and he's actually one of the ones who teaches that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| and I think we're going to have the fire safety trailer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| And you all are more than welcome to look through it, to crawl through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| It's very educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| I think we're going to have some of our gators, if you all are familiar with that, special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3988)|
| 1:06:37| market squares sent down the city, some of the Irish festival, Italian festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=3997)|
| 1:06:46| They're used in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| And the gators, what we use those for is it's like a small ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| It's got a place where we lay patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| It's got all the medical supplies, all the equipment we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| It's just not a fully functioning ambulance or else we'd take them to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| But I'm looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Chief Owen, if you're free, you can stop by if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| But I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Chief Sharp, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Chief Byrd, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| And, like I said, we're looking forward to continuously fund this, you know, with the city's blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4037)|
| 1:07:25| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| I'm planning on being there, and I'm looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| What was that date again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| When is it this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Thursday, this Thursday, the day after tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Just spray his window with the hoses when you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| And thank you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4067)|

| 1:07:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| 11U is a resolution authorizing the filing of an application for an H1 overlay for the Old South High School property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| located within the city of Knoxville at 953 East Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4078)|

| 1:08:07| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| I didn't see your light, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Is the owner here of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| I don't know if the owner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| Is the owner of that property here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I guess he's not here, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| Has there been any effort made to contact the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| Councilman, we do have two people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Good, good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| I noticed we were moving forward with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| We did have two people sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| And the first person is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| If you would come down and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4130)|
| 1:09:03| My name is Monty Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| I live at 3029 Davenport Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| When the school was first threatened with demolition, we petitioned the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| and we got almost 1,000 names of people that wanted to see the school saved and reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| And I don't think that's changed much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| If we can delay this until we get an H-1 on the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| I think there may be somebody with some vision that will step in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| and possibly if Mr. Cassaray would do the right thing and put the school up for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| then it could be an asset for the community instead of a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| It's a beautiful building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| It was built in 1935 by Charles Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| So we would like to see this H-1 overlay approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I have a question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Mr. Stanley, do you know, I mean, is he a willing seller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| Do you know if he would sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| I don't know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| But I've tried to call him several times, and I just don't get a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| You know, I support maintaining the building, keeping the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| I have a little history with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| You know, I just think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| I'm not sure if it's appropriate to intervene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| and I'm wondering, you know, if we could have a little discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| Are there any other vehicles, Councilman Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| that could postpone the effort or delay a potential demolition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| This is the vehicle that is before us and has been approved by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| So, I mean, to me, that's the most appropriate path for us to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| One of the things that I guess if we were to go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| and it succeeds through MPC and back to the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| that there might be potential increases in costs to bring the building up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| and might make it impossible for the seller to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| That's sort of my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| And I ask the question, Councilman Pavlis, to you because I think you brought this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| But maybe I could ask Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| do you know of any other vehicles that we could use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| any kind of a moratorium on demolition and that kind of thing that might temporarily slow this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4285)|
| 1:11:34| while we have a chance to talk to the owner and see what the owner's thoughts are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| if he would sell it, if there are potential buyers, what his, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| what his intentions were, what they might be, that kind of a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| I don't want to see, I definitely would not want to be somebody that would vote, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| against this and see the school demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| But on the other hand, I think there's got to be somewhere in between that we can have that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| before we go through an H-1 process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| You could do a temporary moratorium on demolition permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| but then you're going to have a moratorium on demolition permits across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| And I suspect that the unintended consequences associated with that might be more than you would really want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| In addition to which, even if you did a moratorium on demolition permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| that would not apply to any demolition permit which has already been sought, which is already applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| And I think that may be true in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| So I don't see that as a vehicle that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| You could probably condemn the property and buy it if you wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| You have the right of eminent domain if you want to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| Vice Mayor, we have one other person signed up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| And that is Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| She may have some information to give us concerning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| Hi, Kim Trent, 112 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| I'm the executive director of Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| We have been working on the South High Project since the summer of 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| We have been through an RFP process twice with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| and we also had the public auction that resulted in the current owner's purchase of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| And we've had two developers in the past with a proven track record who were ready to step up and do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| who were thwarted in both cases for something that would take me the rest of the night to tell the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| This project throughout this has been greatly supported by the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| They want to see it saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| They want to see it reused for residential or office or assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| We have met with the current owner who claimed at the beginning of this process that he was going to save the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| He was going to reuse the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| He did put a roof on it, which was much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| However, he has never secured the building from vagrants or any other type of vandalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| Most of the windows are now broken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| He's been a completely irresponsible property owner who poses a danger to the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| The building is just a few feet from the teacher training center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| where the Knox County schools have spent millions of dollars to put that building in a great usable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| And so to me, the building is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| We have an irresponsible property owner who, out of the blue, without any warning to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| decided to demolish the building after all of his claims that he would be reusing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| So I think it's time to use this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| As far as I know, there's no other option to delay a demolition permit being issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| I think he did apply with the wrong name on the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| so that was a reason that it could be rejected immediately and could not be used right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| But if we hesitate, he could definitely demolish the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| And it's not what the community wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| It's not what people who are in support of preservation across the community want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| And I think that 180 days, it's just a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| You're not putting an H-1 on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| You're allowing it to go through the Historic Zoning Commission, MPC, and back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| and you will have the final say on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| But I think it does allow 180 days for a little clarity of thought, possibly, by the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| as to what his intentions are for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| We are more than willing to help him sell the building, find another buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| I've already met with him and explained the incentives available through the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| through the City for Historic Schools, through the Historic Preservation Tax Credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| We've had the Tennessee Historical Commission declare the building is eligible for the National Register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| and eligible for the incentives that come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| So I'm sorry he purchased a building he was not qualified or capable of tackling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| but that is what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| And now, you know, it's time for us to try to step in again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| and have a final resolution that's what the community wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| and allow him to exit from the process, I'm hoping, in the next 180 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Trent, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| I'll just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Well, what can we do between now and in the next 180 days to eliminate the safety and the health hazards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| Had a meeting recently with David Brace and folks in codes enforcement to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| The building needs to be secured immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| The rear portion of it has never been completely secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| You can easily get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| I hate to tell everybody that right now, but you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| You can walk into the building and deterioration has continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| So it needs to be boarded up and secured, which isn't, you know, an inexpensive thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| but he is obviously not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| And I'm also curious as to the cost for demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| because it seems to me demolishing a 40,000-square-foot building made of brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| that has withstood the abuse it has taken for the last 20 years might be an expensive task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Well, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| I guess I'm hearing what Mr. Bailey is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| and that is are we sort of interfering with private property for someone who bid it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| and other people could have bid it and got it and didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| On the other hand, we hear that the community and the other entities involved would like to see it preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| I guess my question is for Mr. Donaldson probably, this would go to your body to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4642)|
| 1:17:32| is it fair to say that the owner will have a chance to give his reasons why he wants to tear it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| or do whatever he wants to do and be represented there in any fashion he chooses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| In other words, there's no due process issue here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| We're just asking you to look at that if we pass this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| As I understand the resolution, it's authorizing the council to submit an application for the H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| That will trigger the scheduling of a public hearing at the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| and the Historic Zoning Commission, both of which will make a recommendation back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| the city council, regarding the change of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| But more specifically, the property owner will be heard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| He will have the opportunity, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| He will be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| He's not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| And I understand Mr. Bailey is saying that, you know, this man, for better or worse, chose to bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| He purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| He has a right to use it to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| And so we don't want to trample on his rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| But he'll have an opportunity to be heard if he chooses before MPC, before it comes back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Ms. Trent, is that building on the historic registry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| It has been deemed eligible for the National Register by the Tennessee Historical Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| We got that determination several years ago when we were going for the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| because we wanted to provide a list of possible incentives for developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Ms. Trent, I believe I heard Mr. Stanley say that that was a Charles Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| Yeah, it was designed by Charles Barber, built in 1935, 1936, and it's a beautiful building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| Being a Barber house, that pretty much adds more to its historical value and its architectural value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Charles was the son of George Barber, the Victorian-era architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| and Charles went on to form the firm of Barber & McMurray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| Mr. Brace, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| I guess I would like to know if the owner of the property actually has a demolition permit in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| Do we know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| I guess Mr. Brace may be able to answer that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| That application, as Ms. Trent mentioned, was made but under the improper owner's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4785)|
| 1:19:54| We currently do not have an appropriate application for demolition, so a permit has not been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| If council passes this tonight, this resolution tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| and it goes to all the appropriate bodies to investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| is there anything to prevent the owner from applying and getting that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| before these other bodies can act on what they need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| Well, we will go on the advice of our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| According to the zoning ordinance, once the application is made by city council or the mayor or the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| there is now 180-day moratorium on the issuance of a demolition permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| You know, let me say, I mean, obviously I'm bringing this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| and I feel like I'm representing, I know I'm representing the people of the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| particularly South Knoxville, but, you know, folks that live over obviously in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| have a real interest in this, too, because they're preservationists themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| But, I mean, if you look around the city, you look at Park Place, Old Knox High, Brownlow School, Tyson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| and even Flinnegan, even though, you know, some of my district is split on how Flinnegan is being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| but it's being retooled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| You know, and just a personal point here, you know, when you purchase and when you get involved in a historic icon, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| I don't know how many thousand people, you know, graduated through South High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| but obviously there's a warm place in people's heart for that, and they don't want to see this building torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| And I don't know how this is going to end up, but all this does is initiate a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| and there's no guarantee that, you know, that there will be an H-1 placed on it, that it will be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| It won't be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| All it's doing is just going through a process for 180 days and, you know, perhaps somebody called it a cool-down period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| but that's all that would happen tonight is just start that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| It may end up being demolished, but hopefully it will have a lot better outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| and it will end up going on the tax rolls for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| and, you know, a lot of people can walk away from this happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| So, you know, I would just urge my colleagues to approve this, just to initiate the process and see where it goes from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| Thank you, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| Councilman Woodall, did you have a light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Well, I believe we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| I just want to say this again, that, you know, I think we have to be very careful when we intervene with people's rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| and property rights and what an owner wants to do with his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4947)|
| 1:22:35| But having said that, I think that this is a little different because, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| he made the inclination to get a demolition permit under somebody else's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4962)|
| 1:22:50| I think there's a willingness from the community to do something with this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| and we haven't had a chance to talk to the owner to find out if he's willing to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| So between now and the next 180 days, we can and I will have the chance to find out what his intentions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4981)|
| 1:23:10| and what he would do and wouldn't do, and as we go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| hopefully we can find a buyer that would turn it into something very positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| because I know the building very well and it's a beautiful setting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| and there's a lot of things I think could potentially happen with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| So I think I'm going to support this just based on the grounds that it looks like somebody was going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5008)|
| 1:23:36| and I think that there's going to be a good solution to this, so I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| Well, it is a historic building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| and this particular owner has had a number of violations with the city with a number of properties around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5024)|
| 1:23:55| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| I, too, along with Councilman Bailey, I'm going to definitely support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| I also think that when he purchased this property, as I recall, he knew the situation at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5042)|
| 1:24:11| and I know as an architect we get involved with people that end up getting over their heads in certain kinds of projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| but I think in this particular situation, with all the publicity and everything that went on ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| and the other folks that tried to buy the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| that I don't feel the least bit uncomfortable about going ahead and beginning this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| We are talking a process that's going to go 180 days, and we know the will of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| We also know the will of Knox Heritage to try to save this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| and 180 days really is not going to make that big of a difference when you consider the age of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| the historical significance of the building, and what this building means to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| so that hopefully within that 180 days things can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| So I definitely support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| Well, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Item 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Denny's Lawn Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| to provide mowing and landscaping services for state highway medians within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| for a total contract price of $44,095.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| Through these different resolutions where we're paying to mow and to landscape and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5127)|
| 1:25:37| back when the state gave us various pieces of property around at intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| whether it's James White Parkway or around off Paper Mill and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| they landscaped it to where we have to maintain it and at a pretty good cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| And I mentioned then that I think we ought to find a way to try to naturally maintain those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| where we don't have to come back in there with mulch and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| and mow it and spend money on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| And so, Mr. King, I know I mentioned this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| but I think we really ought to find a way to, you know, provide a natural look out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| and just would encourage you to continue to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110322?start=5180)|
