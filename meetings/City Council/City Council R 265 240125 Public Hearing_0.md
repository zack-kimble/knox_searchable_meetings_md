| 0:01:38| Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I'd like to welcome everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| This is the first public hearing this City Council has had, and maybe any City Council has had in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| So normally in our meetings, we do a lot of talking, and we may do a little bit tonight, but tonight we're here to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=106)|
| 0:01:54| And so we are meeting tonight as a result of a resolution passed in June of last year with the purpose to gather testimony about the public's experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=114)|
| 0:02:06| with local services that address emergencies related to mental health, substance abuse, and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=126)|
| 0:02:14| Speakers are encouraged to follow three questions that will help guide them and inform this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| Those were submitted ahead of time to the 25 speakers who submitted their name ahead of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| Each of the speakers will be allowed up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| I'll try to give you a heads up of who's next so you can get ready to come on down to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| We will follow the speakers by brief discussion among Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| We may ask some of the speakers follow-up questions, and we may just have a discussion among ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| So we're here to listen and gather input from the public on this very important subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Let me take a minute to thank everybody that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| No matter what you're doing here, whether just to listen or to speak, including those of us on this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| You could have been somewhere else, but you're here because you care about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| and I can guarantee you that everybody up here takes this very seriously and cares about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| I'll call out some names in just a minute, but I wanted to give a brief update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| I spoke to Mayor Kincannon and her administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| I wanted to give a brief update on one item that springs from this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| and that is funding for a joint RFP or a program to be designed in partnership with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=205)|
| 0:03:34| and other agencies across the city to help contribute a new program towards this cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| So the city and county are collaborating with funds from both governments to follow up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| So we are here to listen, gather input, and help shape that future program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| So without any other further ado, we'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| I have a list in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Like I said, I'll try to give you a heads up, and rightly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| We'll start with Mr. Anthony Willis, followed by Cameron Henderson, followed by Catherine Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| So, Mr. Willis, if you'll come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| If you could state your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| I'm Deputy Chief Tony Willis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Of course, the Safety and Veterans Police Department is where I reside, truly, most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| And I do want to tell you that Chief Noel would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| I am here instead, if not for the park meeting next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| So I want to open to give a little context about my experience with the mentally ill and my passion for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=276)|
| 0:04:45| I worked for five years as a case manager for McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| I was a very young individual just out of college, the first couple of years with the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| And I met some amazing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| And it shaped my thinking to this day and forevermore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| It is an absolute crisis, as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| There is no one that is here that isn't committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| Everybody here is concerned about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| There's no one that is in conflict with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| That is a like-minded thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Or, as you said, no one would have committed the time to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| And I want council to know, and those present, that the Knoxville Police Department is enlightened on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| And it is a point of emphasis and has been for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Not just with training our co-responders and their mission and their passion for this, but all of our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=337)|
| 0:05:46| That is something that we are absolutely committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| And you'll find that our officers who are assigned to the co-response, since it started in 2020, in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=350)|
| 0:05:58| they fielded their first call, in fact, on October 13th, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| There's been some amazing success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| And we know that lives have been changed, but how do you measure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| I cannot give you a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| None of us can on any interaction with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| How that may resonate and how that may ripple into other positive interactions from that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=375)|
| 0:06:23| So, since becoming an officer 28 years ago, I still see some of the same faces that I interacted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=383)|
| 0:06:32| those many years ago from 91 to 96, being on the front end of the bed reduction at Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| helping the homeless by privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| This is not a me moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| I am just telling you my passion and give you context, as is the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| The complexion has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| I was part of the Homeless Coalition in 91 with the first attempt, the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=412)|
| 0:07:01| That is not a failed effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| It is altruistic and still something we all hope to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| It's a big, big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| That a lot of people have worked very, very hard to impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| It's an issue across the country, but we are also part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| The aspects of services that need to be improved is we need more champions for those that are chronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| and persistently mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| We know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Anyone who is involved in that effort, that is someone who is like-minded with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| We thoroughly believe in the co-response program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| In fact, we're the first law enforcement agency in the state of Tennessee to implement one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| We're very committed to growing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Chief Noel, that is his vision, is to grow that program as we can going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| We believe that it has been that impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| I want you to know that our officers, when they are on scenes responding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| it is amazing to see how the person in crisis gravitates to them, forgets about this costume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| and just sees an individual who is trying to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| I've seen it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| That's what they're committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Our capacity, certainly we are always looking at ways that we can improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| ways that we can be better with the program we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| But as I stated, it is our attempt, it's our hope that the program will expand that we are a part of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=513)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Next up, Cameron Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=527)|
| 0:08:56| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I'm Cameron Henderson with the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| I serve on Broadway, 409 North Broadway at the Salvation Army downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| I've been here about two and a half years and have enjoyed my stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| I'd like to tell you about a moment that I observed when we were serving at the cold weather shelter just over the past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| A gentleman who I've seen before in that corridor laid on the floor and began to take everything out of his bag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| every single item out of his bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| He seemed just fine much earlier in the evening, but as the evening progressed, he began to take everything apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| Every liquid he had, much was on the floor, or it was poured and re-poured into different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| Every pen that he had was taken apart piece by piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| We found pens and ink all over the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| He had shaving cream on his face multiple times during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| and he'd walk down the hall and get some coffee with shaving cream on his face and come back and lay back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| He would sort his things all over, re-sort his things all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| By the end of the night, he was up all night, he had re-packed his bag, and he had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| Obviously, we had to clean up quite a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| How do you house somebody with those kinds of situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| How do you help them day by day by day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| This is some of the challenges that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| Some of our staff observe that in the approximately 90 to 95 people who stay with us at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| about 80% of them throughout the year are dealing with some kind of either their observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| or their self-identifying with mental health concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| and about 45 of them indicate that it's causing problems for them to find or to maintain their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| It's one of the difficulties that they're having, either causing evictions because of their trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| or causing difficulty with employment and keeping employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| It's just a very difficult problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| You can add to that often substance misuse, one of the significant issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| People with mental health disorders without treatment or without help, or often with it maybe, will self-medicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| and they'll find ways to relieve some of the challenges that they're having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| and then we have multiple problems trying to help them with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| These complicate issues, and they take a lot of time to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| It makes it very difficult to help someone with these kinds of issues to find housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| and then to keep that housing over time, or else they get evictions, and that gets on their record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| and then we have to start all over again, sometimes, well, for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| It makes it very difficult to get it and then keep that housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| I'll also suggest what things might need to be improved, although I know the community is working hard on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| but case management for housing, case management for those who have these psychiatric needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| or other difficulties, those case managers are vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| We're following a housing-first model in our community, then we need more case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| We need more helpers to take the time to be able to connect with these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| and to reduce greatly the time it takes for them from the time they say, yes, I need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| to the time they are able to enter into a program or to get that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| So more case management, I would suggest, is really, really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| It creates a painful cycle without that because they'll say yes, and then over the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| they lose either that energy, that impetus, or they just get lost somewhere out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| and they don't come back when it's their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| It just creates a very difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| So case management, I would say, is greatly needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| Not implicating that someone is doing anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| It's just more is needed, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| And mental health care system seems to be bottlenecked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| and perhaps because of case management, maybe because of more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| We appreciate the community servants already working on that, but we need more, we suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| Our current clients have to wait up to two months for entry into mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Once they say, yes, I need help, sometimes one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| often two months to get help into some of our local agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| When they get that help, it's tremendous, but it takes a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| How much damage can be done during that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| How many lose their willingness to enter treatment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Or how many get lost during those waiting, those two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| It just creates difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| The last question is tricky because we're doing a lot with the homeless community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Should we, the Salvation Army, then pick up and start this kind of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| directly serving those with mental health situations or needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| I don't know if we should, but we do have spaces available that are either becoming available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| or that have available that could be utilized for those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| We would need a lot of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| The spaces would need to be retrofitted, and staffing would need to be put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| But can we help? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| Is it ours? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| But we can certainly be part of the conversation to determine what's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Thank you, Mr. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Catherine Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Catherine will be followed by Josh Spencer, Ben Harrington, and Gabe Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| Good evening, and thank you for allowing us to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| My name is Catherine Ellis, and I am the executive director of the Knoxville Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| And we are a collaborative organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| We are the hub for all domestic violence services in the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| We have partnerships with just about every agency that's represented here tonight, as well as probably 30 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| In some ways, I think we're the square peg for the round hole tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| We don't specifically address mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| We do not address substance abuse issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| And we are not a group that does homelessness remediation or issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| But a large portion of the victims of domestic violence who come to the Family Justice Center every year are themselves having mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=885)|
| 0:14:57| substance abuse issues, or are dealing with an abuser who has those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| And so it is something that is pervasive in the issue of domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| And one of the things that is hugely important for us, we do immediate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| We talk a lot in the city about homelessness and the need for additional shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| When we have somebody who needs shelter, they need it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| It is not something where we can put them on a list or we can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| And currently, the two major shelters for domestic violence victims in Knoxville, there are 69 beds for women who are fleeing domestic violence and four beds for men fleeing domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=928)|
| 0:15:43| Those 69 beds, 58 of them are available for women with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| If a woman with three children goes, that's four beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| And so that is the grand total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| We have 73 beds in all of Knoxville dedicated for those fleeing domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=956)|
| 0:16:04| I reached out to organizations today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Everybody is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| So if we have a victim who comes in and needs shelter today, there's really three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| First, they can go to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Second, they can go back to their abuser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Third, we at the Family Justice Center try to come up with a stopgap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| And that stopgap for us is paying for a hotel room, doing something to get them intermediate shelter until space at a shelter opens up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=990)|
| 0:16:43| These are people who are fleeing, fleeing a violent situation, and then they get thrown into a situation of not knowing where they're going to stay, potentially with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1003)|
| 0:16:55| It is one of the reasons why victims of domestic violence so often go back to their abusers is because they don't have a roof over their head, and that is scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1015)|
| 0:17:06| I think any one of us would be scared of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And they are put into a situation where their life is changing, everything is blowing up around them, and our city can't provide them with a safe place for them and their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1029)|
| 0:17:21| As far as capacity goes, we do provide hotel rooms and other things, but that is purely based on grant availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1041)|
| 0:17:30| Our entire operating budget is $520,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| Our partner agencies come to us to provide the hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| They do not have that ability in their funding because of the way funding is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| So we do the majority of that on a very limited budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| One thing that would make it much better for us and for victims in general is to increase the capacity of shelters for victims of domestic violence, especially those with children, in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1069)|
| 0:18:05| Another part of this is law enforcement's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| We need law enforcement to be able to make determinations at the scene of whether or not somebody needs shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| There's a process for that called the Lethality Assessment Program that we think KPD and KCSO should hopefully implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| I do have a paper on it that I can provide to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| It's something that would require some training, require some updates to computer databases, but it also requires an increase in the amount of shelter space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1108)|
| 0:18:39| Because part of it is if a patrol officer on scene determines from this assessment that lethality is a high risk and that this person needs to escape and get away, they call the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1119)|
| 0:18:51| And they get them into the shelter immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| And right now we don't have any beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| So we can't do that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Thank you, Ms. Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Next up is Josh Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Josh Spencer, 10,140 Gallows Point Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| I'm here representing American Medical Response, who's the contracted aimless provider here in Knox County and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| AMR responds to about 60,000 911 calls each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| About two-thirds of those are in the city limits of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Of all the calls we respond to annually, almost 10% of those individuals are experiencing some sort of behavioral health crisis or a substance abuse overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:43| That number is staggering in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| The severity of their illnesses and issues, they do vary fairly widely from some just feeling anxious to some that are experiencing significant psychotic episodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1186)|
| 0:19:56| Unfortunately, these numbers seem to be rising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Over the last three or four years, it's steadily increased, and we're fearful that it may continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| Today, most of these patients are being transported to local hospitals where they do receive stabilizing care, but not long-term services, not long-term solutions available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1205)|
| 0:20:14| We're certainly encouraged by this hearing and by the group of stakeholders that are coming together in recent months to expand the opportunities for behavioral health care outside of emergency departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:26| Late last year, the Knox County Health Department established a task force of hospitals, public safety agencies, and behavioral health clinicians to achieve this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1226)|
| 0:20:38| This task force meets regularly to establish protocols for which patients can be safely treated in outpatient behavioral health centers as opposed to being transported to the ED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1238)|
| 0:20:48| Groups involved currently are the McNabb Center, the Knoxville Center for Behavioral Health, University of Tennessee Medical Center, East Tennessee Behavioral Health, and Ridgeview Behavioral Health are very actively engaged on solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1248)|
| 0:20:59| Because this particular issue represents almost 10% of our work, AMR certainly has a very strong interest in increasing the availability in crisis areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1259)|
| 0:21:11| Since 2022, we've operated a nurse navigation program where 911 callers with non-emergencies can receive help with accessing local care instead of going to the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1271)|
| 0:21:24| Our hope is that with that continued partnership of many of these agencies that I've mentioned, we can continue to get more help to these mental health patients and those that are having a behavioral health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:37| Finally, as we embark on a new contract that begins February 1st in the city of Knoxville and Knox County, we are hosting a meeting even next week with police, fire departments, public health, and hospital systems to launch another avenue of collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1297)|
| 0:21:53| Our focus next week and in the coming months will be solely to expand our services for those calling 911 with non-emergent conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1313)|
| 0:22:01| As we work together on these solutions, we will certainly keep the council informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| We feel like our partnership, or we're happy to offer any of our partnerships, our resources, our clinical data, our clinical expertise to anyone looking to enhance the mental health system, the mental health crisis, and substance abuse in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Next up, Ben Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1343)|
| 0:22:32| Good evening and thank you for the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| My name is Ben Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| I'm the CEO of the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee, a position I've held since 1994.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| Our offices are at 9050 Executive Park Drive, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| That's the Cedar Bluff area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| To answer the questions that are before us today, we have had some very positive experiences with the existing crisis response services and the city of Knoxville's lead co-response unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1374)|
| 0:23:12| It didn't always start out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| My expertise really started in 1998 with an officer-involved shooting death of a resident here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1395)|
| 0:23:24| I had to get real mouthy at the time before I learned how to be diplomatic and convince the mayor at the time, Mayor Ash, that we needed to improve law enforcement training with regards to mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1404)|
| 0:23:41| He agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| And so we had that opportunity to expand mental health training with our law enforcement officers in a big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| But that's led to a natural evolution of our community's response over the next 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1430)|
| 0:24:00| Doubling mental health training for law enforcement officers led to the creation of the crisis intervention team, which would lead to where we are today, a co-response team led by a social worker and a police officer to respond to calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1440)|
| 0:24:17| So what's the next evolution of our response in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| Certainly what the chief wants to do in terms of fully expanding the police-led response team is appropriate to make sure it's offered 24-7 and is fully staffed to be engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1463)|
| 0:24:37| That unit, when you compare it to other communities across the country, is actually stellar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| Only 3% of calls do not end up in mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| They end up with the incarceration of the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| So it really is stellar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| But let's ask the question, where else could we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| And that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| We could make Knoxville even a better community with its response efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| And that's what we've been asked to discuss a little bit today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| But how we get there is what needs to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| And I don't want to make it look like we're poking fingers at anybody, but we don't have really great data on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| We really do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Our colleague from 911 is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| I'm sure he's going to talk a little bit about the 911 center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| And, you know, there's a lot of calls that come in to the 911 call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| There's not really great data that exists to show what the resolution of all those calls were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| What happened to the folks that didn't have the co-response team called out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| So there's a lot of people that we don't know the resolution of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| And so that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| The other issue is we have 8,500 people that go to an emergency room in Knoxville annually for a mental health cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| Two-thirds, 5,610, are non-urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| So what happens to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| So there's some data holes that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| And so we do need much better data to be able to better understand the breadth of our challenge before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| So I did want to say that where we go with this is very important for us all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1581)|
| 0:26:32| We could stay with what we've got, a law enforcement-led co-response team, or we could go for the brass ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| We could do what very few other communities across the country do, and that's actually do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| So think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| We could do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| We could do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Nashville has both programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| They have law enforcement-led and a civilian-led response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| There's a way to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| They require a ton of training, a ton of expertise with 911 to train their folks to dispatch appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| But we could have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| We don't need to walk away from today thinking it's a one or the other proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| If we want to make Knoxville great, and it's already great, we want to make it greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| we need to think about how we do both to really serve the people of Knoxville well in their time of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| Next up, Gabe Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Ms. Klein will be followed by Brad Anders, Leanne Heumann-Hillyard, and Misty Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| My name is Gabe Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I'm with Volunteer Ministry Center, 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| I really struggled with what to say about my experiences with BMC with services that address emergencies related to mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| substance use, and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| How are we even defining an emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Some would define an emergency as an urgent, sudden, and serious event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| or unforeseen change in circumstances that necessitates immediate action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| to remedy harm or avert imminent danger to life, health, or property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| By this definition, an emergency related to mental health is a person who is a harm to themselves or others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| while an emergency related to substance use is someone experiencing an overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| But what is an emergency relative to homelessness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| For the person experiencing homelessness, it's that moment when they lose their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| All the other emergency calls from people experiencing homelessness are about a physical, mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| or substance use emergency that's been exacerbated by the experience of living in shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| or a place not meant for habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| BMC, we've used both mobile crisis and the co-response unit for mental health emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| The co-response units are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| They're well-trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| They're compassionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| They're not always available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| And for many neighbors, the presence of a uniformed officer is traumatic regardless of how empathic they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Accessing mobile crisis is an issue when neighbors need to get to an ER for evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| Our state laws also limit what can be done in a mental health emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and often individuals who are clearly experiencing crisis are not enough of an imminent risk to be hospitalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| and that can be very frustrating to wait for somebody to decompensate before they can get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| At BMC, we're trained to administer Naloxone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| We call 911 in cases of overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| While some first responders are great, others treat our neighbors with disrespect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| and make degrading comments even when the call is for a medical emergency completely unrelated to substance use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| It's my belief that we don't really have an emergency response system relative to the experience of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| This year, for the first time, we had warming centers, which were very well used and very much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| We have emergency shelters, street outreach workers, case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| KPD does respond to complaints from house neighbors about encampments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| but none of those responses fulfill the immediate needs of the person at the moment that they become homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| Our current system lacks the ability to provide that immediate action to remedy harm or overt danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| It's been said before that all of our service systems suffer from a lack of capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| Given this lack, our homeless service system would be improved by all providers using our coordinated entry system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| known as CHAMP, to assess vulnerability at the first contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| and then prioritizing the most vulnerable for placement into their programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| This would allow CHAMP to function as the triage and coordination system it was intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| Universal use of CHAMP would mean that our limited case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| and housing services are being provided to those most in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| It would also allow us to define a clear path towards housing with neighbors upon their first contact with the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| and it would help us quantify what additional resources are needed for rapid rehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| and permanent supportive housing and develop a true community response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| We need an alternative trauma-informed mobile behavioral health and medical response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| for mental health and substance use crises and physical health checks where there's no violence involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| One of the things that prevents neighbors from accessing care currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| is that they don't reliably know who will respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| Neighbors fear legal punishment or degrading treatment because they've experienced this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| not from every response but from enough responders that it prevents them from seeking help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| A new option for consistent trauma-informed response would increase the likelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| that people reaching out for help will actually engage in needed follow-up treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| We greatly need to expand access to low-income affordable housing, especially for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| The thing that ends the emergency of homelessness is housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Without an adequate supply of housing that people can afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| no amount of connection to services or trauma-informed emergency response will be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| The vast majority of those experiencing homelessness don't need permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| They simply need an affordable home and short-term support to become stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| A lead agency in our community that could focus on landlord engagement to expand access to housing is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| We also need supportive housing outside of the homeless services system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| According to the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| we only have 36 licensed mental health supported living beds in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| PSH provides an additional 333 housing units for chronically homeless individuals and homeless veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| who need support services, but people should not have to experience homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| especially not chronic homelessness, in order to access supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| The lack of capacity in housing, substance use treatment, mental health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| and physical health care means that neighbors can't follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Adults are responsible for their own choices and decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| but none of us function our best when we are in crisis and our options are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| VMC welcomes the chance to be involved in creating a system that better addresses the needs of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| We're not mental health providers. We're not first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| We do engage all the time with neighbors who are encountering barriers in our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| and we'd like to be a part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Thank you, Ms. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you, Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| Hello, Vice Mayor and Council. It's great to be before you today, and thank you for inviting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| Our office obviously takes – I'm Brad Anders, Knox County Executive Director, Knox County 911, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| Our office obviously takes thousands and thousands of calls a year related to folks that are dealing with homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| mental health issues, mental crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| and they don't necessarily come from someone in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| It may come from a passerby, so a concerned individual or a caseworker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| And we would like to have more resources to send instead of – the co-response is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| It's a great first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| But if we had – and we are more than willing and eager to participate with anybody that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| or the county contracts with and ask us to facilitate sending some different assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| then, well, it's normal, an alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| We can't – we've been asked on a few occasions to deviate from our contracts with the city and the county or the MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| We can't get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| We are responsible to the city and the county to use their resources and who they ask us to resource out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2054)|
| 0:34:22| We have spent some time looking for and sent some folks to some training for critical incident training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2062)|
| 0:34:31| to determine on the phone if we can better guide some resources to some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| That's a difficult training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| It's different for law enforcement and fire than it is for telecommunicators that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| and it just takes some more detailed training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| We're trying to find that best practice training for our people to send them through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| That is a process we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| I would say that any resource that we have needs to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| It needs to be available at all times, 24-7, to be the most effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| It frustrates if you have one shift that has a resource and the other shift does not have a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| It can be very frustrating to know what to do with that when you don't have that resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| And so if the co-response unit's unavailable, not only is it frustrating for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| it's frustrating for the officer that has to respond because they know that probably going to be a repeat call coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| because that co-response wasn't available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| So it has to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| It has to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| It has to be something that the resource is always available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| When I started in law enforcement almost 30 years ago, mobile crisis was a brand-new thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| and mobile crisis was so efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| They would come to the scene with somebody in crisis, write the papers right then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and we would drive them to their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| That resource became expensive, and so that, as quick as it was and efficient as it was, it became overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| And so to have something effective, it has to be substantial and it has to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| But we are eager to participate with any data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| The front end is raw data that we'll give you at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| What happened to those folks or what resources they received after we get off the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| or send the resource, we don't get all that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| And so we'll be more than happy to give you all the raw data that you need from our calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| by address, by call type that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| But we're eager to work with whoever, if there is an alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| that when they're contracted with the city or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| we're more than eager to work with them and fit them into our dispatch protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Leigh Ann Heumann-Hillyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| I am Leigh Ann Heumann-Hillyard, Executive Vice President for the Helen Ross McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| You all have seen me provide information for you all in the past on our workshops on this issue before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2228)|
| 0:37:17| What I will say is the Helen Ross McNabb Center has been in the area of providing services for individuals who are mentally ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2237)|
| 0:37:25| providing services for individuals who have a substance use disorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| and providing services for individuals who are in need of housing for over 76 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| In the past 20 years, we have slowly, because of need and because we feel like it's our mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| is to expand services for individuals who are in urgent need or in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| What you've seen in Knoxville, with the help of the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| and entities like the Department of Mental Health, you've seen a continuum be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| I think we could be very proud of that continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| There are still gaps in all continuums and still ways you can continue to refine continuums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| so that you have something for everyone in need to get the right care at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| That's the ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| What I'll say in five minutes, I think my first request would be for us to continue to look to expand co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| It has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Since 2020, we've served and responded to over 3,000 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Less than 3% end up going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Most of the individuals, over 50%, get referrals, just on-the-spot information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| and connecting to mental health substance use disorder treatment services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Many are referred and brought to the behavioral health urgent care center or CSU and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| Many, if need to, we can transport to the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| That process is in place, but we are not 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| We don't have a team that can cover for a seven-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| We have four staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| That is still a need that we would hope that you would consider to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| From the beginning, when we looked at expanding and creating our next step, which was co-response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| we have and will continue to say there is the need and space for an alternative response program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| It doesn't have to be either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| It can be and in both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| We have seen and visited and talked to other cities who have one or the other and both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| and they feel a lot of needs for those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| I think that what I will echo from some of the other presenters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| I would say that if we would want to do that thoughtfully and just look at the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| and make sure that we create an alternative response team that meets the unique needs of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| because there are a lot of different models out there when you talk about in a broad category of alternative response programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2399)|
| 0:40:08| It's our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| It's McNabb's mission to be in this area of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| We not only feel like we would want to be a part of that solution, we want to be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| We also want to be inclusive and continue to refine and support the services that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| So with that, I'll say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you, Misty Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Misty Goodwin will be followed by Gary Compton, Perinda Khatri, and Marty Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I'm Misty Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| I'm the Director of Social Services for CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| CAC has a great deal of experience in providing emergency services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| and even more experience in keeping people out of emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| Last year, we saw more than 52,000 unduplicated individuals whose issues dealt primarily with having sufficient resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| to pay their rent, pay their utilities, meet basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| A lot of what we do is providing that assistance, home repairs, food assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| and services to children through Head Start and seniors through the Office on Aging and Mobile Meals programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| Last year, our Social Services Department provided case management services to over 1,200 households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| and we housed 579 households who were literally homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| While CAC provides an array of social services to meet the significant needs, we are not mental health experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| and we rely on community mental health partnerships to provide services and accept our referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| In our experience, we have found that emergency services do make an effort to engage with the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| the chronically mentally ill, and addicted population in Knoxville in a very positive way from what we have witnessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| When we have someone who is having a mental health crisis or urgent situation and we've had to call KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| we have been told to specifically ask for one of their CTI trained officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| and a social worker that could come out to respond to whatever we may be dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| Our experience, more times than not, though, has been that there may not be one available because there's just not enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:14| that the need is greater than what they're able to do right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| And so KPD typically just sends an officer and whoever they can send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| While these officers have always tried to be extremely helpful and very understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| what we have seen is just frequently they don't always know what the resources are in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| And we frequently hear, unless they are a danger to themselves or to others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| we put them on a no trespass order if they're at our building and we're trying to get them someplace else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| that there's really not much that they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| And so the result, as I said, is people just don't get connected to the resources necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| that we were hoping they might get connected to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| particularly when we are not able to, for whatever reason, connect them ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| Years ago, when we were able to call Mobile Crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| they could send trained mental health responders out to the site where the individual was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| and this worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| As you all know, we serve the four KCDC high-rises that are elderly and disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| and several of those do typically tend to take people who are formerly homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| that are not in mental health treatment, they need to engage in treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| and so we see a high number of people who we need that intervention with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| and just trying to get someone to come on site to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| It's now our understanding that Mobile Crisis is no longer really mobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| and so therefore we really don't call Mobile Crisis as often as we used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| because we know we'll be told we've got to transport them to the hospital either ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| or we've got to call an ambulance to transport them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| And so when it's absolutely necessary, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| But what we found is the best outcome in our experience is if we have a case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| that can go to the hospital with the person to make sure that they get the care that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| and in most cases when we know they need to get admitted, to stay there, to work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| to talk to the social workers on staff at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| to really try to engage and get the services that they need to have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| While we have found that that is very successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| it's simply not something that's possible with everyone that we see who has this need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| While we have both the VHUC and CSU, there are several significant barriers that we see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| such as the limitation on who is eligible with the majority of referrals restricted to who KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| Mobile Crisis, and McNab staff identify as eligible people who can go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Accessibility creates an issue just because of location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| It's off Ball Camp Pike, which is close to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| but it's not particularly conveniently located if we just wanted to send someone in to go out to walk in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| when that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| It's also in our experience that many officers have been trained in the CIT training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| but they're not always, as I said, currently, they don't know the current available resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| and so we frequently see people just not getting connected where they need to get connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| I will just say that right before I came to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| I encountered a gentleman who was significantly mentally ill at the close of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| I engaged with him myself, tried to get emergency, well, tried to talk to him about where he had been before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| He didn't know his name, didn't know where he came from, and couldn't really tell me much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| And so we ended up luckily being able to use CAC Transit to get him transported to CARM for the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| and we will follow up and try to engage with services tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| But that's typically sometimes the only resource that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| especially when there's not 24-hour care available or emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| And so we support definitely both options between KPD and the partnership here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| but also to have more 24-hour availability for people in mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Mr. Compton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2769)|
| 0:46:17| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| My name is Gary Compton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I'm Deputy Chief, Operations, Knoxville Fire Department at 1630 Huron Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| So first and foremost, I want to thank City Council for allowing the Fire Department to participate in this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| KFD regularly responds to calls for service that relates to mental health, substance abuse, and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| In 2023, we responded to approximately 29,000 calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| 963 of these calls were related to overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Finding effective ways to address these issues can undoubtedly benefit our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| The Fire Department's mission is to save lives and protect property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| We are willing to support the community stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| whether it be additional training for our personnel, such as crisis intervention training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| linking people to available community resources, or partnering with local health care leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| so that existing response structures can complement the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| We look forward to hearing from all the speakers tonight to discuss ways that we can be more effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| and we offer our input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Question number two, services that can be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| I think the key word here tonight is more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| We've heard more mentioned often, so I think it's more options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| We've got to remember that we want to get the right care to the right patient at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| So everything has a trickle-down effect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| Mental health, substance abuse, homeless, a large amount of those folks wind up in the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2881)|
| 0:48:11| The emergency department's become overloaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| We wind up with our EMS folks tied up on those type of calls, fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| So that takes away from the other emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| So I think the take-home point is just more options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Thank you, Deputy Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2911)|

| 0:49:19| Cherokee Health Systems is an integrated provider of primary care medical, behavioral health, dental, optometry, case management, and pharmacy services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2959)|

| 0:49:41| And then we also see a number of unhoused individuals in one of our six clinics in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2981)|
| 0:49:50| I'm also a licensed psychologist, so I'm a behavioral health provider, and I am very passionate about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| And I feel like I can speak both from a clinical perspective as well as an administrative perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| These are complex issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Even one of them, substance use disorder or mental health issues or housing, all the different factors that go into this, these are incredibly complex issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3007)|
| 0:50:19| They will not be fixed by one solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| They will not be addressed by one silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| It is going to take an entire framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| It's going to take a really nuanced, scalable network of committed individuals and organizations, which you already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3032)|
| 0:50:41| You have the ingredients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| We stand ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| It is going to take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| But the level of coordination that is needed is truly, truly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| And I will comment on a number of key points made by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| Number one, this is a continuum, and this has to be tailored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| People are not like individual robots, everybody presenting with the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| We're not like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Everybody is different and has different needs and different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| We need to build a system that will be responsive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Because right now, we are often using some of our most precious resources in ways that are not the most impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| So whatever system we have, we need to make sure that it can be tailored to the need and it can be resilient and flexible enough for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3090)|
| 0:51:41| This is a model we use as an integrated primary care provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| If someone has physical health issues that are minor, they don't get the most intensive level of care and a ton of medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| They get exactly what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| If someone has multiple chronic health problems and multiple chronic mental health problems, then they will get a much more intense level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3116)|
| 0:52:07| So that matching of need with service and resource, it does take time to build and coordinate, but it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3127)|
| 0:52:17| It is being done throughout the healthcare system, and certainly it's something at Cherokee Health Systems we're very, very passionate about and intentional because our resources are so limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3137)|
| 0:52:29| They're really limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| We stand with all of the others here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| We want to be part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| We want to be part of the overall plan and approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| I will also advocate for some attention to prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| Many of the things that people have talked about is what we do to prevent emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| If we put all of our resources at the end, where people are in their most dire circumstances, then we will never catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3171)|
| 0:53:02| We will always be reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| We have to start looking at prevention, at-risk intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Let's try to help people before they get in such a bad place that they are in a place of despair, and we need an entire team of community resources to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3188)|
| 0:53:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Next up will be Marty Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Ms. Baker will be followed by Keith Allshuler, Tammy Snyder, and David Akers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3210)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you for having us tonight, Vice Mayor and the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| This is my first getting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Care Cuts was born in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| I'm just a barber, born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, and wanted to cut hair for the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| I had volunteered for about 10 years for Maxine Rains, and I saw that we needed to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| Care Cuts was birthed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Through Care Cuts ministry, God has used us to realize these needs that everybody has spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3249)|
| 0:54:18| I want to bring up my experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| I just want to share with you, we are boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| We're no barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| Everyone is welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| We don't care if you're red, black, or white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| You don't have no appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| We don't care what religion you are, and everybody is welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| And the people that I meet on Ground Zero is what I call it, they can't make appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3279)|
| 0:54:47| They don't know what day it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| They don't even remember their birthdays sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| So we start with a haircut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| And I don't know, but I want to ask you all, how does a haircut make you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| How does it make you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| It makes you feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| It makes you feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| Then we realized that they didn't have a mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| So we started getting their mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| And then they were like, look, look at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Look, Miss Marty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| And then they start looking, and they're like, wow, my daddy, my mama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| And they want you to sit down and for you to look at who their mama was and who their grandmother was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| And so it brings them back to not that they're homeless and that they're an addict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| I don't think anybody would sign up to be an addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| If we took a clipboard and passed out at haircuts, I don't think one person would sign up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| And that's what we've realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| Thank God that many has escaped addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| But I've learned that it starts with mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| So what we do at haircuts is we cut their hair, and then we get them clean clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| And then we get them a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| And then they get the haircut because we don't have a salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| But we cut their hair after they get their shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| And then they go to resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| What is resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Resources is you can use our mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| We can get you a birth certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| So we partner with Connect Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| We send them over there with a bus pass to get their voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| But I'm from Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Miss Marty, I ain't got no $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| I said, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| If you're from Florida, we don't care if you're from Wisconsin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| We're going to get you a birth certificate today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| So that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| So once they get their birth certificate, their ID, their hard copy, so that they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| that they can't get the Social Security card without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| So this is what hope and dignity and restoring life is about at haircuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| And I'm going to fast forward to the Justice Center, okay, because I've just got one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| The Justice Center is the perfect model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| It's all under one roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Randy Nichols is the smartest man I know, and that's who built that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| The homeless community is all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| You've got VMC up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| You've got CARM over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3452)|

| 0:57:46| I mean, I run my wheels off, and I'm happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| But when you take them to Centerpoint, and they call you when you're 10 minutes down the road and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Ms. Marty, you've got to come back and get him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| He needs a medical clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| And I said, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| You don't have a nurse there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| You don't have a doctor at the Helen Ross McNabb BHUB and all this Centerpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| You've got to come pick him back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I said, you're lying, ain't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| So I go get him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Then we go to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| And then we sit all night, and we come out with a medical clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Then we go back to Centerpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| So collaboration is what Jimmy Buckner taught me, and it's what we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| The medical and the mental is not even collaborating, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| And we should be able to call one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| VMC should be able to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Daryl calls me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| He's the only one I hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| CARM, we'd be able to pick up the phone and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| We should be able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| We should all be under one roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| And can I get an amen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Next up, Keith Altshuler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| Well, good afternoon, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| My name is Keith Altshuler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| I'm the administrator of Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center at 1901 Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| And as we've heard already and will continue to hear from all of our community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| the growing and dramatic increase in mental health, substance abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| and unsheltered individuals in Knox is continuing to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| And unfortunately, many of these patients, as we've heard as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| present to our hospital EDs after they've been picked up in the field by the first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| Many of them are suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, noncompliance with their meds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| or have overdosed on illicit medications or alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| Some simply need food and shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| To give you a sense of perspective on the numbers of psychiatric visits we've looked at over the last many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| many years, we've seen a 161% increase in the numbers of psychiatric admissions to our hospital EDs since 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3593)|
| 1:00:03| So that's a 15% increase year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| And with closure of Tenova Physicians Regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| we saw another rapid increase in that rate of admission to our facility in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| I noticed with interest also recently a consultant report that was given to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| I think by one of the EMS providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| and they indicated that the high volume of EMS runs to Mission District and back to our hospital in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| and UT as well, have gotten to be outrageous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| and it really is taxing on their ability to respond to other community residents throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3636)|
| 1:00:44| And similarly to that, the more patients that we've seen and we continue to see in our ED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| it's taxed our facility as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| So it's added time for every admission for everybody that comes to the hospital in an acute basis trying to get served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3653)|
| 1:01:02| I saw one patient that I'm very much aware of that saw 220 visits to our hospital alone last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3662)|
| 1:01:11| From what I understand, they spent other visits in other facilities all year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| They probably spent a day in a hospital 365 days a year all year last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| probably getting food, probably getting shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| getting all the admission criteria and analysis that we need to do to clear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And that's sort of what we're dealing with day in, day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| And I had a whole list of other patients that were at our facility multiple times during the week throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| and it continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| We've done a lot of things to try to improve the speed in transitioning these patients to psychiatric hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| We have psychiatrists that are on staff in the ED constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| We're constantly trying to dispose of these patients in appropriate hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| We have peer navigators, extreme amount of expense trying to resolve some of these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| because we are a safety net for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| I've concentrated on psych admissions in particular, but I could also spend as much time on substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| We see so many patients that have contracted AIDS, HIV, hepatitis through sharing needles on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3735)|
| 1:02:24| We've seen patients with active liver failure from chronic alcohol abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| and I think particularly heartbreaking is the number of mothers that are addicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| and their babies, of course, are now addicted and have NAS syndrome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| And so these are very expensive problems for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| and for the providers to try to take care of all these increasing numbers of patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| And I think to try to resolve it, as we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| I think we need to work very quickly to get a regional psychiatric ED on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| I know we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Sometimes these patients can be stabilized very quickly on an outpatient basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| If they come to the hospital and get stabilized, we're taking up vital space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| We're taking a lot more time to get them to psychiatric facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| and so I think that program needs to be funded and it needs to get up ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| We've already heard about the development and need of transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| We concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Absolutely need to have temporary housing and supportive services for these folks that they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| The multidimensional collaborative interventions that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| this is not an easy one-solution problem to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| I think if we have some subsequent rapid rehousing where we have rental assistant programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| and so forth for the patients and for the citizens going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| it will further help us have the time to get them into long-term situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| We've got a lot of pilots working with CARM and working with Samaritan Place to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| It's proven helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| We just need to get more money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| So I appreciate your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| Tammy Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| I am not Tammy Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| She was unable to join us this evening and asked that I come on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| I am Jeanette Bergen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| I am of leadership in both child help and care cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| I see both ends of our community from the abused children to the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3866)|
| 1:04:34| And what we seek in our area is to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| The definition of homelessness is without housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| We need more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| We have got to have more low barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| That means you can be mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| That means you can have substance abuse so that you can still sleep inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3893)|
| 1:05:02| Sleeping inside, having heat, having water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| should not be an option that can be withheld because you're mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3907)|
| 1:05:15| or because you have an addiction issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| We can address addiction and we can address mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| once we can get you from freezing to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| So let's start with low barrier housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| Care Cuts collaborates with multiple community resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| We are so thankful for the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| We are so thankful for the mental health training that we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| our first responders have because it totally tailors how they respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| to the clients that we serve at Care Cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| We are a community resource that stands in the gap for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| that may have addiction, that may have mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| but are definitely homeless or at least on the cusp and at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| With that position, we see what happens when people are in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3971)|
| 1:06:20| All of this could begin to be addressed with more transitional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| more affordable housing, more supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| with case management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| But first, we have got to have a low threshold entry to get off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=3992)|
| 1:06:43| Only then can we program towards success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| At Care Cuts, we work with a whopping $196,000 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| You have a furrowed brow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| We're proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| We started out on my credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| So let me tell you, it wasn't at $196,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| What I can tell you is that we're serving approximately 400 people a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| that we have provided over 90,000 meals since we began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| The haircut is the carrot to get them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Only then can the mentoring services, the case management services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| the resources be accessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| Thus far, we can account for 500 people that we've gotten off the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| into housing, into treatment, into a better life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| And do you know how many staff we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| And we started that in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| Before, we were 100% volunteer, and we are still 100% donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Feel free to pass the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| But please know that without the opportunity for low-barrier housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| none of this can begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Nothing starts until we have a roof and four walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| Next up is David Akers, followed by Stephanie Burridge, Elizabeth Rowland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| and Kim Wilson-Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| So I'm obviously not David Akers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| I'm here to speak on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| He wasn't able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| My name is Katie Hanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| I also am a volunteer with CareCuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| I would say just my experience with volunteering there for the past year is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| that the emergency services and response teams aren't really good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| I can't really speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| I would speak with the fact that the homeless that we deal with have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| substance abuse and mental health disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| So we're dealing with a collaboration of all three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| So, like, everybody here is speaking on different subjects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| but we just need to bring it all into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| It's always an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| I'm also a veteran of the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| I was in the Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| And I've noticed that at CareCuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| and we don't really have a lot of services for homeless veterans because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| don't really want to differentiate or with substance abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| or mental disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| So bringing that in as another option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| an opportunity for CareCuts to elaborate with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| The big thing I would think of is that why aren't we working together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| The things I've noticed volunteering is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| that's where we have a stopgap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Like if we're reaching out to one service to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| they're like they can't do anything or their hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| And it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| why don't we have a phone book that we allow everybody to be able to use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| And I think what we could do to alternatively improve it is just being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| to communicate and have an open communication between all of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| Sorry, I'm really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| And I got told 10 minutes ago that I was going to be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| So I'm just going to go back to my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| I got three minutes and I know I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| I've encountered various responses from the police and the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| when they do come and respond at CareCuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| The cops that come on Sundays, they're the police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| They're so sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| They're so respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| They speak to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| They talk to them just like they would if they were their brother or cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| What I've realized is that this could be your brother or your aunt or your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| sister and you don't know where they are and you can't find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| And CareCuts gives them an opportunity to have an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Maybe you can get a hold of them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| Maybe you can see them there and have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| So I would say that we get a lot of mixed attitudes when it comes to overdose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and addiction with the Narcan or different things when it comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| So just having that opportunity and having resources where we're able to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| the ones if they are overdosing, like I am a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| I'm not certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| I don't have any degrees in mental health or substance abuse, but I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| witnessed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| I've been a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| I've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| I've watched friends die and it's like you couldn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| So I feel like having trainings for civilians like why we should all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| how to use Narcan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| We should all know how to save someone's life regardless of not having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| certification or if I'm not wearing a badge, like if I see you dying at a gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| station, I should know how to train you or how to save you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| So, you know, offering training classes for people that just want to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| that just want to be able to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| So it's like how do I do that efficiently and not kill somebody by trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| help them because they're dying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| It just seems that the level of support depends on a specific circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| If you fit this criteria, then we'll help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| But that doesn't necessarily work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Nobody fits in a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Everybody's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| So I feel like that would be something that we could look at is it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| case by case or we can't just throw them in something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| And then also something that we could look into is having like a dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| mental health person with the police officers when they're responding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| those things because police officers are also not licensed psychiatrists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| So you don't know what someone else is going through or what if that's mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| break or are they high on meth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Are they going through a paranoid schizophrenic episode also high on meth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Like I don't know how to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| So, you know, having those free trainings for anybody and anybody that wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| to come out and help and do something and make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4349)|

| 1:12:59| tonight about the emergency response system in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| Our organization oversees a transitional housing initiative catering to women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4384)|

| 1:13:37| Since in the past year we have engaged with the co-response team five times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| and I want to share our experiences during those five calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| Out of the five requests for co-response support only two have resulted in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| dispatch of co-response staff to our location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| The remaining instances we were informed that the co-response unit was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| unavailable and leading only to a uniformed officer responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| On both occasions when the co-response unit was dispatched we had to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4449)|

| 1:18:07| So first I'll share a couple stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| One day I was at work and my loved one called me extremely upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| This loved one has several diagnoses such as PTSD and schizoaffective disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| They had been experiencing an ongoing challenge related to their living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| environment that was triggering anger and hopelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| They called me because they knew that they didn't want to respond to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| situation in a way that could dangerously escalate it, but they were very angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| and needed an outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Their therapist was not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Similar calls came in subsequent days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Fortunately my boss was very understanding, but I was not equipped to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| appropriate care for my loved one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| They needed someone trained in how to de-escalate mental health crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| They also needed someone with whom they felt safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| As I sought out resources to support my loved one, I called the mobile crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| unit hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| The first time they spoke with my loved one, it seemed to go pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| but the second or the third time became less productive because the job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4746)|

| 1:19:15| crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| It's really to identify if someone in a mental health crisis needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| institutionalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| My loved one started sensing this through the questions being asked and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| no longer felt safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| I have also seen firsthand my loved one engaging with police during a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| triggered moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| One day I went to their house and a pair of police officers was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4775)|

| 1:19:40| I learned that the one police officer was waiting outside because they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| repetitively told my loved one to stop cussing and the situation had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| escalated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Somehow it was determined that the one officer should leave the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| and wait outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| My loved one needed someone to listen, not someone to tell them what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| or who uses their authority to subdue them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| Another aspect of this is that my loved one doesn't trust most police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| officers to keep them safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| That day and other subsequent days, my loved one asked me to stay until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| police officers were gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4815)|

| 1:20:22| Think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4822)|

| 1:20:41| Or worse, someone who might shoot you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| As a result of these experiences, I will not call 911 or co-response if my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=4844)|

| 1:41:24| So that looks like one van being available 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| and between the hours of 11 a.m. and 11 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| a second van on the streets to provide extra coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| as we have found that statistically those are the boundaries of our peak hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| In the city of Springfield, we also provide 24-hour coverage in that city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6101)|
| 1:41:49| So, we respond to all sorts of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| In our community, we are the third branch of public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| so we have police, we have fire, EMS, and we also have CAHOOTS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| The types of calls that we respond to really run the gamut of mental and physical health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6125)|
| 1:42:13| So, this can be welfare checks, wound care, basic first aid, we take vitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| we check blood sugars, we respond to family disputes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| we respond to individuals who are experiencing all sorts of crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| including suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| as well as providing death notifications when those events emerge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6151)|
| 1:42:40| The average call volume that we've seen over the past three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| has been about 16,500 calls per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| and the teams that we have are dispatched from our local public safety answering point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| So, there's a couple of different ways that a person can receive our services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| or different ways that we'll end up showing up on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| A person can call 9-1-1, a person can call 9-8-8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| a person can also call the police department non-emergency line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| And so, there's no wrong door to be able to access our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| Now, once one of those calls comes in, it goes to dispatch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| and the dispatcher will collect all the information that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6209)|
| 1:43:36| about what's going on on the scene, and it's at the point of dispatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| that the appropriate resource is decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| So, either we will be sent solo or sometimes in conjunction with the dispatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| Sometimes in conjunction with a police response and or a fire response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| A classic example here is in the event of a suicide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| where the police will respond to that incident for a death investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| and we will also be responding to take up the crisis side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| for any individuals, family, friends, etc. that may also be on scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| to provide that crisis support and de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| That component of being integrated into the public safety system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| is really fundamental to our model and the lines of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| that we have with other first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| so that our teams are on the police radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| so that if something is happening or we pick up a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| if we need to have some sort of assistance one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6291)|
| 1:44:57| whether it would be a police backup, which is extremely rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| or an ambulance to be able to transport someone to a higher level of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| we don't have to pick up the phone and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| We already have the radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| We can communicate seamlessly with other responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| Mr. Walsh, I failed my duty to remind you about your one minute remaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| so I'll give you 30 more seconds if you could finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Oh, sure. I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| We serve all demographics in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| Many of the folks that we serve are unhoused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| but we absolutely respond to all sorts of calls and all individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6332)|
| 1:45:40| I can say that the value that's seen in our community for the work that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| is in the fact that the contracts that we have with the city of Eugene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| and the city of Springfield have been continuously renewed year over year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| and that we take calls that a police officer doesn't need to respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| and also that fire EMS, it's not acute enough for them to need to be there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| That is also a big part of what we do, and I appreciate the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| and happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| Thank you, Mr. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| All right. Next up is Joy Ellis, followed by Allie Cohn, Rick Roach, and Michelle Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6378)|
| 1:46:25| Is Joy Ellis here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Oh, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6389)|
| 1:46:37| Hello. My name is Joy Ellis, and I reside in 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| I come to you today just to share some experiences that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| with the police in mental health-related emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| One time, I got fired from UTK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| They just said that I was let go, and I didn't have any other source of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| I was homeless at the time, and I didn't have any transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6422)|
| 1:47:09| so I just walked on down to the Casey's and locked myself in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| And then I got fired from UTK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| So I just walked on down to the Casey's and locked myself in the bathroom there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| I didn't know what to do, and I had the cops called on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| And what the cops did was force a confession out of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| hauled me off in a car, and refused to take me to the hospital of my choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6456)|
| 1:47:44| There, I was yelled at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| I was placed on a dirty floor with no food or water even offered for seven hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| And a police officer actually came with a needle to threaten to sedate me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| when I started screaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6481)|
| 1:48:14| Police are here to just make sure that business is going as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6494)|
| 1:48:35| They don't have any place in mental health-related emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6515)|
| 1:48:42| because what I have experienced is just fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6522)|
| 1:48:51| I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what they're going to do to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| I'm just terrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| And as someone who suffers from PTSD, I have 9-1-1 called on me or to call 9-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6540)|
| 1:49:15| maybe once every two or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| I would feel much safer, much, much safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6560)|
| 1:49:28| Much, much safer calling civilians rather than cops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6568)|
| 1:49:38| to come deal with me in a triggered state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| That's all I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Next up is Allie Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| Hi, my name is Allie Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| I reside at 3406 Orlando Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 3797.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| I am here tonight to read the following statement on behalf of a Knoxville Heart member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| Hello. I am writing this statement on behalf of my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| and in memory of my father who died while in police custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| I have chosen to keep his identity anonymous because this is still a very sensitive topic for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| I am sharing this as a member of Knoxville Heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| and as a Knoxville community member impacted by policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| In 2017, my father died in a KCSO transport van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| He had no prior arrests, was an outstanding community member and business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| and has been missed by countless friends, family and golf buddies ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| A community member called 9-1-1 after witnessing my father drive off the road and crash into a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| When the officers arrived at the scene, he had urinated on himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| could not support his own body weight and had slurred speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| He then vomited on himself in the patrol car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| These are official notes from the arresting officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| He was arrested for driving while intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| When they attempted to load him into the transport van,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| he could not stand and he fell face forward onto the ground, resulting in face bruising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| Since he could not hold himself up inside the communal portion of the transport van,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| they put him into the cramped isolated side compartment alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| Medical attention was never given to him and he was never checked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| Other detainees in the transport van were upset and expressed concern for him to the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| My dad then spent four hours alone in the transport van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| During these final hours of his life, the officers had even stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| to pick up another detainee at the former St. Mary's Hospital location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| Imagine that. He was experiencing a medical emergency that was ignored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6722)|
| 1:52:09| was at a medical facility that could have saved his life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| and yet no one felt enough concern for his humanity to ask for help that was less than 10 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6733)|
| 1:52:21| By the time they arrived at the detention center, many hours after he was initially detained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| he was unresponsive. It was too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| They had done absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| There was no concern or care towards him, no medical support, no compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| When we finally received the autopsy report four months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| we realized this death was preventable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| While he was also intoxicated, my father was experiencing a treatable medical emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| that ultimately led to his death after officers neglected his health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| I asked the investigators why the officers didn't call for medical treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| when they saw a senior citizen who couldn't walk, talk, or hold himself up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| and who had urinated and vomited on himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| They told me that officers do not like to take their detainees to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| because it makes it harder to book them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| The irony of this is outrageous and devastating because they had stopped at St. Mary's already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| How easy it would have been to ask for emergency assistance if only that had been a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6804)|
| 1:53:31| if only my dad was seen as someone who needed help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| instead of immediately being criminalized and dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| This was one of the hardest things for me to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| My father did not get the medical attention he deserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| because that would have made it harder for the booking process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| It would have made it harder to punish him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| So instead, he died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| The months and years after his death were filled with questions, anger, and grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| Through my questioning, I discovered alternative response teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| I learned about how cities had been dispatching these teams to a wide variety of calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| including substance use just like my dad's situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| If my dad had been responded to by a team with a medical professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| he would likely be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| If the officers were concerned more with his health and safety than making sure he was booked in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6857)|

| 1:55:11| What is your experience with emergency services related to mental health, substance use, and homelessness in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| I've been homeless, I've used drugs, and I've had mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| On my way to work, year 2000, I was on Paxil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| Decided to come out public because it was killing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| Had an episode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Pulled over right at the intersection, 275 and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| Did not want to engage with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| Not in the state that I was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Eventually, my wife, my son, contacted them, contacted the nurse at the internist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6946)|
| 1:55:54| Not a psychiatrist, but an internist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| That's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| And they told me what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| Or they told them what to do to get me into a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| Because I knew then I could not deal with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| Or they weren't going to be prepared to deal with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| Substance use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| Done a lot of drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6975)|

| 1:56:25| But here's another part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| I have enough presence to have been appointed to the Neighborhood Advisory Council for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=6986)|

| 1:56:41| I have enough presence to have been a board member of Tennessee Healthcare Campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| The only consumer organization in terms of healthcare for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| You're going to have to do your jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| You have this chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| You have this chance not to play games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| Also, I'm a member, I call it an associate member of HART, Knoxville HART.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| And here's what we've gone through when I've been on our collaborative calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7029)|
| 1:57:17| Too many games are being played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| We don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| We don't need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| This is too important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| Too many games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| We need to be straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| We don't need to be negotiating behind the scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| Everything you guys are involved in, in terms of mental health care, emergency response, should be public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7048)|
| 1:57:38| We should know what you're saying and thinking, not what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| We should be public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| We should know what you're saying and thinking, not have it come out at the last moment when really nothing can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| Because that indicates that you all have an agenda that you want to carry out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| And I'm talking about process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| Because if you also have a priority in your minds, collectively, in your minds, that you will obligate the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7078)|
| 1:58:07| Because I don't want to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| I don't want to hear those stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| I don't want to hear these stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| I don't want to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| I'm tired of hearing these stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| I'm tired of watching and knowing I can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| Because I've picked up enough homeless people and given them rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| I've taken food down there enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| I'm tired of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| Our response is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| I'm tired of seeing people do their drugs in the open with security present and nothing can be done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7112)|
| 1:58:41| I'm tired of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| If we have one thing, I would love for you all to sign a statement that you all will obligate $10 million to first start with alternative response to add it to the mix of co-responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7127)|
| 1:59:04| And what they've described, people have described about co-responder not responding is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| Let's get that straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| I used to be in the Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| What did we say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| All hands on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| All hands on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| No agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Just take care of the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| First and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| And then maybe things will get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| You all have to prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Say you're going to obligate the resources first and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| Because if you don't, it's only going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| And when it gets worse, it's going to be one of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| It may have already been one of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| You all don't want to talk about it and deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| But when it is one of yours, don't come tapping somebody on the shoulder saying help because that's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| Because that's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| Next up is Michelle Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7210)|
| 2:00:18| Hello all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| My name is Michelle and I'm a third year student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| It's a pleasure to meet you all tonight and I would like to thank everyone who has shared a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| We are gathered to discuss a reform of first responses in Knoxville, particularly a non-police alternative response in response to non-violent emergency calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7228)|
| 2:00:37| As all of you can attest to, dispatchers tend to turn to the police department first in an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| Although it's almost impossible to contest that the system has done some good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| I am of the belief that the observed and documented dangers far outweigh the benefits of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| In order to understand it, we should discuss them in the context of psychiatric and medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| In recent years, psychiatric care has been among the most pressing of public health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7257)|
| 2:01:02| I'd like to credit USA Facts for aggregating and reporting these statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| According to the South Dakota Unified Justice System, 10% of all police calls pertain to wellness checks or other psychiatric crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| According to the Kraser Family Foundation, suicide in Tennessee was a second leading cause for death in adolescents in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| And over 20%, that is over one-fifth of high school students reported serious suicidal ideation in the year 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7279)|
| 2:01:26| And accordingly, Tennessee has 16% of mental health workers required to meet the needs of the general population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| Nationally, we only have 27%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| There is absolutely no doubt that some level of intervention is critical to the prevention of suicide and aid in mental health crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| But it's widely acknowledged that the majority of patients in need of care are non-violent and pose no risk to police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| So I have to ask, why are patients treated as if they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| According to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, mental health patients were 16 times more likely to be fatally injured in police encounters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| In a system that is meant to save a patient's life, allowing preventable deaths as we have seen previously is unacceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| especially because people of color and those in the LGBT are disproportionately targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| This is not an isolated incident and the system is so prone to exploitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| It's not at all uncommon for patients to experience further distress upon apprehension by police forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| The distress that has prompted a crisis to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| In an instance where they're in dire, fragile states, why are they subjected to more fear and peril?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| Why are we punished for experiencing crises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7353)|

| 2:02:41| On the 17th of November, 2023, I experienced a mental health crisis that necessitated medical intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7361)|
| 2:02:48| While I thank the Knoxville Police Department for their immediate assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| it would be remiss to withhold my many criticisms of their care and handling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| During previous hospital visits for issues pertaining to my physical health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| I was informed of my condition and at least allowed communication with my immediate family regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| Police presence was minimal and patients were made to feel comforted in their times of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| Yet when I was admitted to the same hospital in the same city for a psychiatric crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| I didn't have the right to be informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| I wasn't conscious upon arrival to the hospital, so when I awoke, I didn't know how or when I arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| I had to find out from someone else that I was dragged in the back of a police car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| I had to find out from my own medical records that I had to obtain myself how long I was out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| what condition I was in, how I was treated, because I wasn't told anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| When I woke up, the first thing I remember was the only way I had to communicate with my loved ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7414)|
| 2:03:41| being taken away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| I was in a dirty room going in and out of consciousness for about 12 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| and for 24 hours I was in a locked room in solitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| I was let out maybe one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| I was barely able to access basic necessities, such as the use of a restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| I never had a history of violence or a criminal record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| and yet I was kept in isolation for most of my stay and left uninformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| And yet, in spite of this, I think of my own experience as one of the better ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| During my 36 hours in the hospital, I listened to police and medical doctors berate patients under their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| As many have said, if the patient's concerns were even acknowledged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| personnel would laugh amongst themselves, saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| oh, don't take that person seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| Regardless of whether or not the patients were cooperative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| there was never a reason to have berated them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| nor advise police to dismiss their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| I also want to note that this isn't exclusive to myself or the facility I was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| I've heard many testimonies with a personal friend of mine, a transgender woman, being sedated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| Many people have discussed threats of sedation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| and this woman was sedated and kept in similar conditions to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| We didn't forget Lisa Edwards, who died in police custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| Her final moments were spent being juried, and that never had to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| Her death and those previously were entirely preventable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| This isn't exclusive to one or a few officers, but it's something systemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| I don't doubt that there are good officers, but to law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| you have no place in incidents where law has not been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| For that reason, I believe it is necessary to reduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| if not alleviate, police presence in psychiatric or medical settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| I urge the City of Knoxville to consider implementation of this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| Thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| Council, that concludes the public speaking portion of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| Now we'll make some time for discussion among council members or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7531)|
| 2:05:51| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| I just want to thank everybody who had come and spoken with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| and shared your experiences this morning or this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| I think it's difficult sometimes, especially when you have experienced some trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| or you're speaking about loved ones' experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| It can be very difficult, even if you're not having those things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| to come and speak to an audience behind you and know you're on television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| and have people, representatives, sitting up here and listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| But I think it's really important that you came and shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| And so I just want to tell you how much I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| I don't think that's – it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| Having discussions about trauma and mental health is also not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| There's too much – even though I think there's been some improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| there's too much stigma associated with talking about mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| And we have to really free ourselves from that and be able to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| people who are experiencing crisis and getting them care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| I really do appreciate hearing from the providers and hearing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| overwhelmingly that we can do both alternative response and co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7635)|
| 2:07:22| There's been good results from co-response, but we need them to be 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| seven days a week, and there's not enough teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| We also need alternative response to be able to respond to different types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7651)|
| 2:07:39| of responses that involve crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| So I was just really glad to hear from everybody doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| and I'm going to continue to work on trying to make sure both of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| can happen and that we can get a mental health hospital here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| I hate to put someone on the spot, but I have a couple of different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| First off, Ms. Klein, I see you're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| I don't know if – are you the only one from BMC here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| Can we get a – there were some questions about the needs for low-barrier shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| which we have at the foyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| How many beds are at the foyer currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| There are 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| We will be closing in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| Can you tell us a little bit about the closing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| Because I will tell you what council knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| I don't want to speak for my colleagues here, but an individual from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| signed up to speak at the podium here and pronounced that it was closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| that we should find out what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| And we all looked at each other, and the mayor said – and the person who spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| said that it was closing because the city was pulling the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| And the mayor said that wasn't true, and I have now heard from other sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| that the lease isn't being renewed from this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| So this is why – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| I did not mean to put you on the spot, but then Representative Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| state rep, spoke with me about it and said people were reaching out to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| and asking her questions, and so I told her what happened at a council meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| So what's swirling around is rumors, and I would like some hard facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| about what's going on with the foyer, because a low-barrier shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| is definitely critically needed, and the conversations that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| with Dr. Spangler in the past was ways to expand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| and how to support adding more beds and new locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| So sorry if you could answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| I can. So the city is not funding us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7785)|
| 2:09:55| We got funding for other programs, but we're not allowed to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7795)|
| 2:10:01| to have the requirements of people working towards housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| and so no funding from the city can be allocated to the foyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| What do you mean no funding can be allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| or you can't require people to be working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| So that was part of the condition, my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| We were told that we would not be funded if we kept that as part of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| So right now, my understanding, having gone out along with social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| at times and how the program started, because I was on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| when we voted to fund it, we went there while the space was being built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| and then saw it open right as COVID started with reduced beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7840)|
| 2:10:47| And the way I understand that it works is social workers go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| and meet people who need housing, people in the camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| They come up to VMC, they work with caseworkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| and as long as they agree to work on housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| they can have bed space, stay with their partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| take care of their pet, do not have to be clean, can be inebriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| All of these are realities and make it a low barrier shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| And so are you saying that someone at the city told you that as long as...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| Is this a fund? I mean, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| We were told that, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| We were told that we would not receive funding if we continued to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| have the requirement that people were working towards housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| So you're saying that the city was asking you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| to just let people use the low barrier shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| but not require them to be working on housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| So it's not that the city said, we won't give you money anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| Period. End of story. I'm just, I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| And I guess I will, as soon as I'm done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| find out from someone at the city, because this is not what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| I mean, we're just not being told. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| And I guess if one of my colleagues knows better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| they can turn their light on and inform me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| What we were told is that, I mean, our total funding didn't get reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| but we were not allowed to allocate any of that towards the foyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| because we were continuing...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| Requiring them to work on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| So in VMC's model and desires, I got 32 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| Best practice is to say you can use the foyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| if you are to be working on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| That's the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| We're a housing focused agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| Yes, we feel that somebody needs to have the goal of working towards housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7961)|
| 2:12:45| for us to want to do a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| That's not the only way you could do a low barrier shelter, but for our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| So that's your model for running the low barrier shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| So let me just get something straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| No one at the city said, we're pulling the plug on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| You can't have 100K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| Is that what we were funding? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| I don't know the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| We were told you can't allocate the money to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| A model that requires housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7989)|
| 2:13:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| I appreciate you illuminating some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| I'll look into it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8002)|
| 2:13:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| And thank you to everyone who has spoken this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| And also to Adam Walsh for joining us from Eugene, Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| I really appreciated hearing from everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| and all of the various perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| especially those who are directly impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| And it was very obvious how difficult it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| for some to share their stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| But you came and you did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| And I appreciate you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| We started off our conversation tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8041)|
| 2:14:07| hearing from our co-response teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8047)|
| 2:14:14| And it just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| That was the first thing that stood out to me was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| Hearing that we stood up the co-response team so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| I mean, I would say within a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| of conversations starting here on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| when we had a series of workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| about how can we reimagine policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| and policing and policing and policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| and how can we reimagine policing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| And then just months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| we're able to have teams responding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8091)|
| 2:14:58| to these 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| That same year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| we were also talking about alternative response in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| But now starting 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| that continues to be a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| rather than a commitment that we're making as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8119)|
| 2:15:24| We said this a lot of times here at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| that we don't want to just keep talking about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| We want to actually move things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| And I believe we're at that point with alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| We've had so much discussion since 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| I agree with the speakers who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| you know, when looking at the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| from these programs around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| we have decades worth of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| that show us the value that these services have for a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8155)|
| 2:16:01| not only in terms of how we would be able to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| emergency services that are available in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| but also how we would be able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| remove some of that work from our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| and shift their energy towards those more critical emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8182)|
| 2:16:28| that we need their expertise on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| Or as someone has said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| when a law has been broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| rather than when someone is in crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| and in need of a public health response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| So what I hope we're able to do, you know, moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8203)|
| 2:16:49| I'm still in support of pulling a task force together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| I don't know how we pull all of these pieces together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| how we, you know, this public hearing is very informative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| and it's bringing new perspectives before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| that will help in our planning and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| I'm not even going to say discussions moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| but in our planning and actions moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8237)|
| 2:17:21| But we need to be able to sit down at a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| and get into a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| Get into the minutia and really to be able to design a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| that fits our city, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| Not just picking a model that has existed elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| but really designing something that works for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| and not, you know, dragging our feet along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| We saw how quickly we were able to put a co-responder program in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| I want us to move with the same quickness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| when it comes to alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| Let's make 2024 the year that we actually see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| a team in place to respond to calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| We can make that happen this year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| We did it with co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| So lots that we could discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| I'm going to keep my comments short tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| but grateful for everybody who came and let's get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8299)|
| 2:18:24| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| I also want to echo a lot of the statements from my colleagues so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| But first of all, just thanking everyone who's come out and shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8315)|
| 2:18:40| or just been here to support those who have shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| We've heard a lot, and it's a lot to unpack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| We've heard from people who are paid to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| We've heard from people who volunteer to do the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| and we've also heard tonight from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| who've actually experienced and survived to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| the traumas that we're discussing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| One thing that I heard resoundingly this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| from everyone is that one size doesn't fit all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| We need more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| We need more collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| And we need more resources to make those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| With that said, I do want to acknowledge those who spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| on personal experiences, and I know that that was very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| to be able to share, and I want to personally say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| even though I wasn't involved in those instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| that I'm so sorry that you all have experienced those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| The mother who shared about calling for help for a teenager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| and the teenager was tased twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| The young lady who was in a crisis and the police was called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| and she had such a horrible experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| The person who shared the letter from a friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| about their father and that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| Those things shouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| They absolutely should not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| One thing that I will say is that, yes, we do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| that KPD has some level of training as it relates to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| but that is not their area of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| That is not their area of expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| and I am speaking at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| And so tonight I would also support a task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| a collective task force, that will look closely at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| and how do we provide that collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| How do we provide more of the resources that are needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| I don't know if Ms. Klein from VMC is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| But I'm also going to ask that we investigate the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| that she mentioned about the funding being removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| from low barrier housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| I know that one of the focuses, it sounds like I heard her say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| is that the funding is being removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| because their focus is on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| And I'm not sure if, you know, I know that they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| low barrier shelter and housing are people who are actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| still in addiction, actively still actively in mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8472)|
| 2:21:17| somewhat crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| So how in the world could they possibly be focused on housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| when they are just trying to survive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| And that's what the low barrier shelter housing supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| And so, Vice Mayor, I'd like to ask you, Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| if you all can help get that information, the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| back to us as it relates to the pulling of that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| and that wording of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| But again, I am committed to that and supporting a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| at this point when it comes back up to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| And so, again, thank you all for being here and for staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| to show your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| And I think someone actually mentioned one of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| that said, you know, some of us have probably experienced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| And that is true because everyone has a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| And I know sometimes people sit out in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| and they look at the people that are sitting around the stairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| But we're human, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| We've experienced some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| And we've had family members that have experienced a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| things that you all are talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| And so these types, you know, substance abuse, mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| it does not discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| And someone did mention that it doesn't matter what color you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Life happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| Care cuts, I think most of those folks are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| But a lot of the organizations that have spoken, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| personally experienced what you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| I've seen it firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| I know people who have taken advantage of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| Care cuts, especially, because I've been down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| And I see the despair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| I see the desperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| I've survived the winter storm that we just experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| And it is heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| Because everyone does deserve the right to have housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| to have shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| No one organization can do it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| But I do believe that if we pull resources and we pull folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| together who have come and spoke to us and are committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| collaboration, that we can do better and we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| I was just going to say, we have been talking about this for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| long time, but I think there were people in our community who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| were far better educated on it and ready to act on it than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| And that's usually the way progress happens is we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| bring people along to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| I was really pleased to hear tonight many of our health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| providers and people who work in the field are understanding we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| need to continue with care like we do with other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| It is time for a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| But what I will say is the task force can't be driven with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| pre-set outcomes and who's going to do what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| We've really got to have a task force that is facilitated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| neutral parties to make sure that we have the right resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| and the right people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| And I think that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| I'm going to ask Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| Fugate to talk about how we put together the best system for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| And that requires a lot of work, a lot of time and effort to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8675)|
| 2:24:38| not an inordinate amount of time, but it is not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| tomorrow that you have a facilitated discussion and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| about the continuum of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| What I will say worries me or worries is too strong a word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| concerns me, is if we do alternative response, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| that is coming at some point, who manages it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| Who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| And when we hear that we have such a shortage of mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| providers already, how are we going to staff it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| I know one of the problems that we, you know, it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| when people say KPD co-responders weren't available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| like they just didn't want to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| It's because we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| When people say KPD co-responders weren't available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| like they just didn't want to be available, it's because we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| find enough mental health social workers to be a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| They may be more willing to be a part of another, but that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| going to be a real challenge, I think, in a field that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| understaffed, under-resourced because there are not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| So I'm not saying that we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| I'm just telling you that that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240125-public-hearing?start=8745)|
