| 0:13:23| I need a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| to approve the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| of the previous meeting. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Second. With a proper motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=809)|

| 0:13:39| 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=823)|
| 0:13:51| Mr. Smith you're up sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| And before I get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| the thing I'm really here today for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| since this is on there as a legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| update. You know I just want to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I want to encourage you all as you all look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| project grad funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| tonight. You know this year we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| able to find $2 million more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| that the BEP is going to be giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Knox County Schools which helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| get us out of the hole we were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| But it's not enough. And I just want you to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| that there are a lot of kids in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| they did not choose to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| born into the situation they're in but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| there. And we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| obligation and a duty to help them. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| project grad is one way that we can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| kids in our community. If you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| history of it, graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| weights at Fulton and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| E have gone from 50 to 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Let's spend the next year working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| project grad and figuring out how we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| that from 80 to 90, 90 to 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| and 95 to 100. How we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| get those kids going into post-secondary education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| I spent a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| hours the other day at TCAT Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| hearing presentations from students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| that were learning about fields that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| had no idea even existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| That's what project grad is bringing that you never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| see on the news, you never hear talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| But they're putting real world experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| in front of those kids so that they have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| opportunity. But the real reason I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| tonight and the reason we kind of kept it a secret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| is because I knew that the person we were going to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| would try and talk every last one of us out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| of it. So Mayor Burchett, if I could get you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| to come down front for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| you're coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| This past session in Nashville, the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| County delegation joined together with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| our House and Senate colleagues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| pass a resolution honoring Mayor Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| for his eight years of service to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Knox County. I'm not going to read the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| We'll take a picture and post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| But I want to pull out a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Whereas it is most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| and appropriate that the members of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| body should honor those public servants who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| performed their duties with utmost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| probity and integrity and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| whose efforts during their time in office have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| dedicated to providing thoughtful and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| exemplary service to their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| And during his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| illustrious tenure as Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Tim Burchett has applied his legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| experience in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| state capitol at the local level to save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| taxpayers millions of dollars and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| restores the public trust in Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| by providing quality services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| and championing efficiency in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| thank you for everything that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| done for Knox County for the last eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| years, for the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| for most of my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| You're standing behind me so I can't turn around and see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| So I'm going to get you up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| in a second. But we just wanted to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| this and present this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| to you tonight, thanking you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| eight years of faithful service to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| and the residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| And I just want you to also know that no big foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| were harmed in the making of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1007)|
| 0:17:05| Y'all can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| We're burning tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I've been watching these documentaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| late at night on Stalin, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| they did a thing where he was being honored by something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| I don't know why, because he was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| send everybody to gulag anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| They clapped for him over an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| hour because they were afraid the first person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| to get sent out was going to get sent to a gulag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Chairman Smith, I appreciate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| I remembered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| when I was chairman of the Knox County delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| the first time I did it, I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| to be the chairman the second time because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| nobody else wanted it. So it's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| thankless job, and I appreciate the great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| you've done for the education of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| our children and their youth, and thank you for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| proclamation. Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| let's continue on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| business. Thank y'all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Okay, on to item number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1075)|

| 0:17:59| Justine, and I'm not even going to try this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| last name. Carson, do you know it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Mr. Chairman, I do not. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| know if Justine is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Is Justine here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| I think I told her it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| the next meeting, so let's move it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1093)|

| 0:19:11| and I'll talk just a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| what's going on at the Zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1153)|

| 0:19:17| we ended last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1157)|

| 0:19:33| and specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| of importance to that for Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| is that 48%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| of those are tourists outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| 50 miles. So the Zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| is the area's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| or the city's number one tourist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1185)|

| 0:19:49| again, those tourists that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| come to the Zoo generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| $28 million in economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| activity for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| So we appreciate the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| that Commission has given us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| We would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| consider the budget request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1207)|

| 0:20:21| And I'm happy to answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| questions if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| If there's anything specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| you would like to know about the Zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| and what's going on, obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| this year, the past two years, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| opened $18 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| in investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| in the Zoo with the Boyd Family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Asian Trek, so Tiger Forest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| last year, Gibbon Trails and Langer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Landing this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| and then we have a new restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| and cafe that is breaking ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And then we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| several other projects in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| the works for 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| and 2020, and all of those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| to improve the amenities of the grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| and to continue our efforts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| be a tourist attraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| and destination for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| When I first became a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Commissioner in 2015, I came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| and you gave me a tour of the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| and I was amazed at when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| said at that point it was like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| 442,000 people that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| to the Zoo, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I'm kind of a numbers guy, and I was like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| that's amazing!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| And of course you could see the school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| and the parking lot from over in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| western North Carolina, so you understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| that, but I kind of thought, well, I wonder if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| this is an anomaly that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| that that was the peak, but now that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| reached 495,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| that is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| So your team's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Thank you, I appreciate that. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Board has a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| credit that they can take with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Since 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| our attendance has grown over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| 100,000 people, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| that can't be an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| We believe it's the investment that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| putting into the Zoo, our advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| and that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| enjoy coming, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| coming back. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| And your new entrance sign, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| The new entrance sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| has, we are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| thankful for that. That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| part of funding from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| And as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| we built that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| because we had heard from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| constituents and stakeholders that when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| got off the interstate, they weren't sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| that they had arrived, they thought they might be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| And so this gives them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| a real sense of arrival. We won| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| an Orchid Award for that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| And so it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| has livened up that whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| place. I've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| visitor from the Audubon Zoo, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| director, visiting this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| and he was most impressed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| that and all of the enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| that the county's partly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Ms. New,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| we had a long talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| how we can get people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| the Zoo and how we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| transportation directly from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| downtown out to the Zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| and back to where they can enjoy both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| And it was a really enlightening discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| And that's something in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| we need to look at and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| how we can do to work with you all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| make sure that people down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| town, when they're here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| another festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| that they can also use the Zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| also. And I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| really pleased with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| enlightening ideas that you gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| to me about the Zoo, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| appreciate you for that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Our Zoo's not only a regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| draw to the area for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| tourism, but it's also a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| that young families and small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| children can use for entertainment and educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| purposes. Did you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| pay Caldwell any kind of royalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| for putting him on the front of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| That's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| It's free publicity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| He's seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Thank you. I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| opportunity and look for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1461)|

| 0:25:29| without recommendation. In a proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Those opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| Confirming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| that item number eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| is Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| It's confirming the Knox County Mayor's nomination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| of Mike Crowder for reappointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| in Richard Graff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| and Tamara Boyer for appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| to the Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| based on the number of emails that we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| in the last 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| I felt that's why we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| pull it off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| And just reading through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| them, I think the concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| twofold. One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| that there's no rush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| two new members to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| MPC. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| the courtesy for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| outgoing mayor should be given it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| to the incoming mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| if I'm reading these emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| correctly. Which makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Two months left of a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Give the opportunity to the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| county mayor to make these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| four-year appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I'd also like to correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| something that I just found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| out on one of the resumes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Ms. Boyer, there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| concerns because she was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Secretary-Treasurer of the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| that that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| not really a conflict of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| interest, but should you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| somebody that's on the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| also serving on the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| And of course, Ms. Boyer's in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| here today, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| thank you for being here, but she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| also resigned that position from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| the Development Corporation, so she's not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| It was the IDB, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| The Industrial Development Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Okay, I'm sorry, I keep...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Yeah. So because your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| resume didn't indicate it, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| indicated you were still on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| the public, I don't think, knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| that you had already resigned from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| So I just want to make that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| for the people that had sent the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| that you're no longer serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| on that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Correct, yes. So I think it was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| And again, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| if you all are reading the same things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| I'm reading, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| what you're... I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| across the aisle, I'm not down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Does anybody have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Well, I... just to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| blunt, I wanted to put in a plug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| for my friend Tamara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| I've known her for over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| She's a very well-regarded attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| in this community, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| spent a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| serving a lot of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| organizations, and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| in every professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| interaction with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I have found her to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| professional, objective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| and frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| a lot of the emails we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| you've got folks who are pro-developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| pro-this, or anything, and frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| you never can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| We've seen some votes come to us where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| we've seen some folks that we would have thought would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| the pro-development folks have voted against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| some things, and you've seen some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| where you've had city of Knoxville appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| vote with the development block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| it's almost like appointing people to the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| We never can tell who you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| going to get, but you try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| put good people on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| boards, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| I can just, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| you could call it vouching for her, but I can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| say within all of my professional and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| personal interactions with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I can't think of anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| that I would rather want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| fall down on my sword for who I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| would be a good person for this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Vice Chair Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I'm going to put a word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| in for Mr. Graff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| I knew Mr. Graff when my hair was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| black or red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| whatever, and we worked together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| a lot about developing through Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| He was the one that recommended me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| to go on MPC, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| he gave me the instruction that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| you make your own idea, you decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| what's best for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1799)|

| 0:30:03| come back up. I understand you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| retired now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| With him being retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| I think he has a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| to go visit each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| and see these kind of developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| If putting a word out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Mr. Graff, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| my pleasure to recommend you for that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| also if the mayor hadn't have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Mr. Wright? Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1831)|

| 0:30:37| anyone's recommendation who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| should be on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I do think that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| developing a concern after some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| discussion with MPC members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| not a requirement, probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| that membership of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1853)|

| 0:31:15| from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| personal point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| maybe disappearing from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| I'd ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| the maker of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| maybe amend it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| or change his motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| forward without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| recommendation so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| I would ask my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| to look at how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| representation of the county is spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| across MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| an additional consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| be given to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| MPC is representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| and not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| necessarily of well-deserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| I'll amend my motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Vice Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| kind of taken aback too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| when some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| ago when we were having a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| on one section of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| county and I said who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| your representative on the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| and I was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| that they don't have representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| from different sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| and when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| was appointed there was a representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| for each section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| but they said they don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| anymore and so anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| I just thought I'm glad you brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| that up and I thank you for bringing it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Commissioner Wright's concern that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| even though MPC does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| have the nine districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| that we do on county commission, it is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| that we have representation from each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| sector of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| and I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| believe that in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Corrington and that east Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| will be the next Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| It's going to start booming. It's going to start growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| that way. Are we going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| someone there in that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| of town that lives there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| that's part of the community? I would probably think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| so. So I just want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| what Commissioner Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Okay and I will speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| to the charter and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| There are no districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| required in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| and there is no requirement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| there's a time period for which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| he can't appoint people. Our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| allows for it. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| pretty sure he came into the same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| with MPC members that he didn't appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| that had lengths of time left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| on their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Did we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| With a proper motion and a second before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2041)|

| 0:34:09| On page 3, item number 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2049)|

| 0:34:33| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| It's under the easement agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| when it says TDC will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| compensation in the amount of $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| for the reference permanent easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| including damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| and sometimes I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| though the amount of money indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| will exceed $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| and if those damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| are included in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| amount or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| $5,000 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| any damages occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Sir, if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2103)|

| 0:35:11| Commissioner, it's my understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| the $5,000 is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| the easement itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| And they are required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| basically reclaim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| any damage that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| in the installation of this gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| line so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| anticipate that there would be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| other damages where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| is going other than where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2131)|

| 0:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| We have a proper motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| and a second before us. All in favor say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| aye. Aye. Opposed say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2145)|

| 0:35:49| next item please. Item number 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| is approving a letter agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| the Simon Youth Foundation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| the receipt of $100,000 designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2155)|

| 0:36:01| This is Resolution 207.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| wanted to ask the question of the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| if we will have to change the name of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Lincoln Park to the Dr. Paul E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Kelly Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| It'll be the Dr. Paul E. Kelly Academy at Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| John, did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Give your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Thank you, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| 912 South Gay Street, Knox County School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Actually, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Mr. Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| had a great comment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| We have various programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| that will be going on at that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| The Welcome Center, our CTE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| administrative offices will be there as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| the Paul Kelly Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| So that is correct. Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| has its own school code number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| and is still registered with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2215)|

| 0:41:39| Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| In the contract it indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| it wasn't for a prom contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| It actually says it's going to be for the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| teacher academy dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| does that cover the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2515)|

| 0:41:59| prom or event venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Yeah, because it actually indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| new teacher academy dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Commissioner, what we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| is trying to bring these form agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| to the board so that they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| have to be individual agreements each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| by school. So we've done several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| of these over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| last few months. But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| It could be a school event or it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| the new teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| event as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| So again, just a form event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| I mean a form agreement so that these don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| come individually to the board each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2559)|

| 0:45:55| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| What was the reason for the reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| in the percentage paid by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Jim Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| The state has a pot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| for bridge replacements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| and the city and the county share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| that pot of money and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| finished up a bridge and had an overrun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| and deducted from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| the account prior to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| project being started so the amount in the account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| was reduced and we matched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| 100% of what was available and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| therefore the reduction in the percent match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Do we get to send the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| an IOU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I don't believe so but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| the city did have an overrun on another bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| and that account is jointly used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| between both unlike paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| but that was the reason for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| deduction and finance asked that we send this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| resolution through as a housekeeping matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Is this the bridge below the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Burnett's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Yes, it's the one that me and you met out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| near Porterfield Gap, the newest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| bridge there at Porterfield Gap that was replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| So the project is complete and has been since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| last summer sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Was this in the pipeline before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Improve Act was passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Yes, sir, it was. This project's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| online for a couple of years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| But anything going forward now, they cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| 100% of the bridge replacements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| TDOT, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| In the Improve Act, we don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| bridges within the Improve Act because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| we don't have any structures that are rated poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| or eligible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| But it still would be 98.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| assuming the money is in the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Unfortunately, in this particular case, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| just had a bridge that went over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| project budget and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| ours was unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| didn't receive the full amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| One quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| The cost of being just over $540,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| did that always stay the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| or did that increase or change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| There was a small...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| On the bridges, we had a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| rock excavation that was unanticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| so I think we did have a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| change order amount in, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| about $30,000. But that was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| administratively. It didn't have to come through this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Jim, this is the Gap Creek Bridge, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| The one there at Porterfield Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2909)|

| 0:48:33| all the time so just to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| it's the Gap Creek Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| not a new Kimberlin Heights Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| Correct. It's the one between Hodges Ferry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Yeah, I said it a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I can't think of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| What project are you borrowing these dollars from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| we just have a general account for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| bridge replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| and right now we don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| bridges in poor condition so thankfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| we had some surplus in that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| You'll see another item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| the Kodak Road bridge replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| We're still able to do that so actually this didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| defer or delay any project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| can you explain why the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| have a joint account and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| how is priority given to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| who gets access to these funds first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| it just depends on who's in the pipeline first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| If we would have had our project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| underway prior to the city's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| we would have been a beneficiary of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| In this particular case, we just came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| afterward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| and didn't receive that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| I will say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| the city has quite a few poor bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| because they maintain a lot of older structures than we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| so typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| they get the state aid funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| We've been at the county for 19 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| and this is the first actual state aid bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| that we've been eligible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| because the bridges are ranked based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| sufficiency rating, all ours are down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| that list so this was really the one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| that we've had the benefit of using state aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| funding because thankfully most of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| bridges are in a lot better condition than the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Does the town affair get share in that same pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| No, sir, just the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Okay, seeing no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| more lights on, is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| We have a proper motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| and a second before us. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Aye. Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| The motion carries. Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Item number 37 is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| adopting the Knox County City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| of Knoxville and Town Affair Get Multi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Jurisdictional Local Hazard Mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Plan, Resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Okay, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Dwight, you knew I was going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| It's like ESP because I sent you an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| But when I was preparing for this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| and we were reviewing this plan, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| very interesting the way that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| working multi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| with both the city of Fairgate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| and the city of Knoxville on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| basically safety plans as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| relates to disaster mitigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| from drought to earthquake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| true absolute disasters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| even how we would prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| for agricultural drought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| So I thought that would be interesting for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| to know a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| about this plan because this is not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| that we see every day in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| of this body. So thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| Thank you, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| The timing of this is actually pretty good, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Mr. Chair, because given that we were just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| the division of money in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| outreach program and the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| role in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| how that affected our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| it's a good time for me to mention that when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| project, this is actually an update to an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| hazard mitigation plan. And when the hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| mitigation plan was originally done, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| ended up funding 100% of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| So when we set out to do it this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| we approached the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Knoxville and approached David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Smoke at the town of Fairgate, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| everybody contributed proportionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| based on their jurisdictional size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| So the plan is actually a true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| regional plan that was jointly funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| by all three municipalities, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| that is a departure from past practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| and something we think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| worth recognition and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| wanted to make sure that the other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| got credit. The other thing that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| worth mentioning is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| this is a plan that sort of sits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| quietly in the background. It doesn't really attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| a lot of attention, but it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| real substantive meaning for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| the families in Knox County that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| do buy flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| the success that we have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| managing this plan and our participation in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| plan directly affects the rates that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| constituents, and all of you have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| of them in your commission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| pay for flood insurance. It's important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| It also helps us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| be eligible for funding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| we can occasionally use to mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| chronic properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| that have suffered from repetitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| flooding losses. The last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| we did was actually in Commissioner Schoonmaker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| district. We acquired a house at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Stevens Home on Bridgewater that had been the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| of repeated and chronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| flooding losses. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| the gentleman in the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| is not somebody who is here, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| just want to brag on him and let him speak to you a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| bit about the program. Eddie Roberts has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| really raised the bar for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| and I will tell you this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| complicated, nuanced work, and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| is really, really good at it. Eddie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| is actually a certified floodplain manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| through FEMA now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| and just so that you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| in order to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| certified floodplain manager, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| become knowledgeable and pass testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| on all aspects of floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| management. So, Eddie even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| has expertise in coastal floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| management, which obviously isn't going to be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| for us, but it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| breadth of subject that he had to learn in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3239)|

| 0:54:03| He's going to give you a little bit, I think, of a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| of the number of families this affects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| We talked about it earlier, and I thought that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| a useful frame of reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| so I'd just like to brag on Eddie a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| bit because, again, this isn't glamorous work, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| it's really important, and let him share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| with you a little bit about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Dwight, you bragged on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| him quite a bit, but I can say Eddie was one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| heck of a softball player about 35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Eddie Roberts from Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Department 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| As Dwight said, we have quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| a few flood insurance policies in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| effect at any time in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| It runs from, the last official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| numbers are 606, but we've probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| got about 70-something in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| addition to that, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| pushing 700 families in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| county of Knox that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| flood insurance protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| The most important component of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| plan is that by having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| our own hazard mitigation plan, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| eligible to supply or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| apply for grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Basically, what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| nowadays is the process has changed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| where when FEMA allots a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| of money, say they send $12 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| to somewhere in West Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| after a natural disaster, if all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| that money's not taken up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| the process now is to try to leave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| remaining parts of that money in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| of Tennessee and any municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| that has a hazard mitigation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| in effect and approved by FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| is allowed to apply for the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| that are left over from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| We have, as Dwight said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| taken advantage of that for the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| house that we mitigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| and we have several others on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| the list of future mitigation projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Any questions about the specifics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| You can look through the 400-page document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| if you're having trouble sleeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Eddie, where was that house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| It was on Bridgewater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| It borders the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| The backyard goes down to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| Actually, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| were successful in that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| It was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| pre-disaster mitigation grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| It was suggested we not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| apply because we had to compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| nationally for it instead of just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| statewide, but we went ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| and applied and actually won the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| That project was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| finished about two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| Now it's a nice passive part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| that may be used for certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| I've been wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| let Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Vanderbeek know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Eddie and I have become really good friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| over the phone, but I've not ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| been able to pick your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I don't know if the rest of you commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| have dealt with Eddie, but Eddie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| always responds to my e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| calls me back, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| I didn't know. I mean, I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| he's a big deal, but he's really a big deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| for Knox County. So, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| you, Eddie, for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you. And Randy was pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| good on the diamond, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| once upon a time, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| Eddie and I were on the same team a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| A long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I will throw my hat in there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Eddie and I played on the same softball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| about 40 years ago, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| He is one heck of a ball player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| And thank you, Eddie, for everything you do for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| and what you've done for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| You have quite a reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| in our town and our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| for all the excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| Michelle, is your light on by accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Is there a proper motion and a second before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Opposed say no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Item number 42 is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| approving an amendment to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| contract number 18-068| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| with Landscape Workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| to provide mowing services for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Knox County Parks and Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| which amendment adds additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| sites and areas to the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| resolution 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| I'll make a motion so we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Yeah, Doug, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| What was the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Motion to approve, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Doug Battelle, Knox County Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| So I think this is like the third time we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| to come around with mowing contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| in the last six to eighteen months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| I guess, with add-ons, subtractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| Is this something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| the prison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| that the prison guys could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| and save us money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Are we going to be dealing with these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| every six months because somebody can't perform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Prison industries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| may be able to do this a little cheaper for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| We can certainly take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| I think one of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| we do get with using inmates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| because we use them on several projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| and I know they assist with other projects in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| is transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Having scheduled mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| once a week is maybe a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| for them, but we can certainly take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| It seems that we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| keep vendors on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| If we've got inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| in the prison industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| up there that could do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| it may cost us a little money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| capital-wise, but we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| getting it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| We have added several parks over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| as opposed to adding more full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| employees, so certainly as we add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| we're maintaining that process to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| we get good contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| and make sure they understand the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| and deal with them if they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| We can certainly take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| How many vendors do we currently have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| under contract for mowing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| I believe we have three right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| How many six months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| About the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| We've kind of fluctuated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| We changed a little bit to zones this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| to try to get focused in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| so they're not spread out so thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Roughly the same number of vendors, contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| mowing roughly the same amount of parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| yet we're having to increase the mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| and areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| We have added more parks into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| the mowing rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| Each year we've tended to add a few more parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| We're up to about 32| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| of the 42 parks now that are contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| mowed that used to all be mowed by county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| I had a question some time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| when these contracts were being let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| There were over 13 that had bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| for these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| was some things in there that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| disconcerting. We had been doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| with some of them that did a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| but then we decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| limit and pull down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| to I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| lesser numbers of contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| that would give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| us more mowings or they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| cover bigger areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| But the other way was working and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| some of these people were bidding fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| competitive. Why did we go to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| lesser number that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| in the previous years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| I think by lesser number you mean the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| zones that we have now? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Again, what we had was one contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| was doing a lot of parks across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| and so we were trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| make it more manageable for the contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Well, I just wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| we did that, we revisited this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and I didn't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| we do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| contractors and less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| area to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| We've got a situation which I asked before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| are these people have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| that they have what they told us they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| by the number of mowers, the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| of employees, the number of trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| and I asked that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| and they said well we just take their word for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| and now we're finding that they can't do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| jobs. Is there a better way that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| find out if they've got all the stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| that they tell us they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Certainly, I think we can add requirements into that bid process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| and we can work with purchasing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| This addition today, quite frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| was two areas that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| were mowing with our crews that we hadn't realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| we added. A senior center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| and a library so that's why we added this one in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| we didn't have in the original contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| First Memorial Library, I thought it was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| under contract because I hadn't seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| contract mowers out there mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| so why has it been added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Well, I think it was just the area around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| the library itself that was left off the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| contract. Again, it was something our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| didn't realize we had added on as the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| went on but it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| In some parts we mow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| the grass around a senior center and a library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| in some parts we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| It's a bit of a mixed bag which is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| something to look at too if there's some efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| sometimes there's also rotations that are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| with these as well. I've talked to purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| about that, about looking at trying to cluster our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| contracts together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| better with the school system for efficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| but again they do a much different schedule than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Well, I'll say one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| thing for the school system. Their mowers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| superintendent, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| run over trash. One piece of trash turns into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| 5,000 pieces of trash because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| take time to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Just a note for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| The Milton Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| Community Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| that's a community center like a senior center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| What is that? Just a small community building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| and a ball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| And Knox County Sports Park, I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| we already took care of that ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| What we do on some of those sports parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| what we do is keep our crews working inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| the fences and we found it more efficient on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| some of those parks to have a contractor do what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| outside the fences. So again, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| always trying to look at the efficiencies. The most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| efficient way to use the full-time employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| with the county as opposed to the contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| I understand. Sometimes we think we're saving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| but the problem is that we've been having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| they don't sharpen their blades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| They beat the grass down. It's not mowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| You and I have had some discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| I think we need to seriously look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| and communication on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| what's to be mowed when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| bit out and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| They think it's just supposed to mow the inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| of the field, not the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Better communication to have too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Yes, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Just piggybacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| a little bit on what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Bussler said. It wasn't that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| didn't have the equipment and the last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| we let go. These weren't doing the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| correctly, right? Yeah, the last one we let go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| we went through several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| of inspecting their mowing, trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| them to correct it and still not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| a good job. But it wasn't the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| that they had? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| I'd like to just ask Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| employees do we employ now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| in our parks and recs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| to just mow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Do we have part-time? Do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| full-time? Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| we need to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| take this more seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| If we're going back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| with all these contracts and they're not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| right or it sounds like a lot of people don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| who's responsible for mowing what areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| to take a look and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| see. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| wondering how many employees we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| have and what all we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| are responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| mowing. Yeah, the main parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| I think we probably count about 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| of our 40 maintenance workers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| just do mowing. That we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| for Knox County, we have 20 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| 40 full-time? Well, we have 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| total maintenance employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| About 20 of those would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| be mowing grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| The parks we focused on have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Concord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Tommy Shumpert, the Sports Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| and US Sailor and John Tarleton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| because those are our tournament facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| We've kept our full-time staff there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| to have good control over those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| because they are high use and they host tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| We've tried to look at contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| out the other parks that aren't quite as critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| Well, they're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| critical in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| making Knox County look good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| for our taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| that want to enjoy them with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| families and all. I mean, it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| like a lot of 40 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| to just focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| four parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Again, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| reiterate that. That's 40 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| total, about 20 mowing grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Now, about 10 of those are at Concord Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| because that's a massive chunk of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| land there that we take care of. So about 10 of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| they're not only mowing grass, they're picking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| up the garbage, they're doing some of that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| as well. And I didn't mean to imply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| too that we want a lesser standard at other parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| but obviously at the sports facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| there's a much higher level of maintenance that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| to occur there. You know, some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| ball fields are mowed two to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| times a week, whereas a standard community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| park would be mowed once a week. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| we've tried to look at that efficiency of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| contractor doing weekly mowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| more efficiently than what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Thank you, sir. Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Seeing no lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4039)|

| 1:08:04| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4084)|

| 1:08:13| with that level investment, I wanted to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4093)|

| 1:08:22| connected plan is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| to impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| the role of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| would be at a million dollar investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4112)|

| 1:09:32| improvements over that last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4172)|

| 1:09:36| the work that you and the board have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| and to convince Chris that it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| worthy investment is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| tough of county dollars because he treats them as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| his own so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4186)|

| 1:09:54| going on. It's exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| It's a main attraction in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4196)|

| 1:10:00| a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you. I appreciate that and I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| just say that in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| current capital campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| the support that we've received from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| the county as well as the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| has enabled us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| leverage that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| private dollars and the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| dollars now surpass the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| investment from city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| but you all have been the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| momentum that allowed us to get that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| going and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4226)|

| 1:10:36| I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| the words that are here and I fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| support these words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| What I was wanting to make sure that my fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| commissioners understand about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| is it is a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Maybe Commissioner Anders can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| link back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| an earlier day in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| when county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4256)|

| 1:11:00| a certain funding level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| to a commitment to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| and I'll call it a health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| care location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4266)|

| 1:11:10| commission may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4270)|

| 1:11:16| as we started out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| I'm wanting to reemphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| the fact this is a five year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| million dollar a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| totally supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| and allow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| to have the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| assurance and faith in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| we will fund this five million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| It does come from hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Yes. Right, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| not something that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| reassigned or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| a different vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| of a different commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| come with a different outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| I am imploring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| the members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| commission to make sure that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| commitment is fulfilled over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| Commissioner Anders, did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Just to be brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| it's also something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| that we're just finishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| up our payments on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| capital campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| When I first saw this, my first question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| that I reached out to Chris on was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| how are we doing on cash flow out of that fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| This is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Chris, you can elaborate if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| but we're not changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| dramatically the actual cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| flows from that fund that we've been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| in recent history to support the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| This is going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| new commitment for new projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| to help the zoo drive new visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| We have been making similar payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| to this in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| This is not new and incremental funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| This is closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| on one investment in the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| and the beginning of a new contract to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| to invest in the zoo out of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| tourism and tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| I can speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4386)|

| 1:13:10| He was at a swim meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| in the budget that you all just approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| for FY19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| there's $900,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| in there for zoo capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| This is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| a continuation of that from Phase 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| to Phase 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| That funding is there and will continue to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| As we see growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| as we have in that fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4414)|

| 1:13:38| pay for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Seeing no lights on, we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4424)|

| 1:14:18| I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4458)|

| 1:14:48| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Motion to stand with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4492)|

| 1:14:58| are you here still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| to pass this on to our regular meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| with no recommendation, but if you wish to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| you can go ahead and you can also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| come back next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| and speak again to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| We can't hear you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Can I give the commissioners a handout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| He's pretty tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4522)|
| 1:15:34| Sir, raise that mic for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| It's difficult no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| I hope to get us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| There's a button there to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| that whole thing. No, in the cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| The way to raise that thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| The whole unit, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| How you doing, man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| No care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4560)|
| 1:16:10| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| George Underwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| 1941 Executive Park Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Suite 216.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| I'm here to talk on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| Twin Creek Road closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| and communicate to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| that there is significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| opposition in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| to this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| For example, there's a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Harris Chapel, that's in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| right off of Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| that if you close this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| that's going to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| the access to that church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| That church was the victim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| of arson a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| I think law enforcement will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| whenever you close the street and make it a dead-end street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| you increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| vandalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| There are some other reasons why I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| this commission needs to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| about the way this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| happened. That's what the handout is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| that I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Each page is numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| You see in the upper right-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| one, two, three, and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Pick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| You will see that this is a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| that was posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| about a meeting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| with the county commission on March 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| and a meeting here on April 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| you approved on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4652)|

| 1:17:36| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| I assume, I believe, my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| is that you had a work session before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| that time, but you will notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| that no one showed up at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| session in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| That was the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| The reason was because there were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| That's one of the things I want to communicate to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| There are a number of procedural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| with the way this has come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| Let me just tell you what I base that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| If I'm not really prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| understand I just got contacted within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| 24 hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Within that 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| what I found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| The property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| and let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| I did two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| This morning at 8 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| I went to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| department engineer on West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| I had to wait for Mr. Snow and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| in a meeting, but he was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| accommodating, very professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| After he got out of the meeting, he met with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| and one thing I asked him for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| was a complete copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| of the file Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| has on this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| I was shocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| because there were a number of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| were not in that file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| when you have a closure, normally it's initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| by the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| No property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| initiated this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| That was shocking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Normally, I know in the city they had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| go through MPC and I had a conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| county officials as well and they said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| we don't have to go through the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| Nonetheless, you still have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| notify adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| I was submitted to this commission that it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| important that people affected in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| area should be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| One of the things I was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| for when I got the file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| this morning was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| certified notices showing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| adjoining property owners had been notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| and it wasn't in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Now, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| 30 minutes before, well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| an hour or so before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| I got some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| that was provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| by the Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| for record keeping purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| this morning there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| 27| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| pages in the official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| file on this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| There were no notifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| of certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| mailings notifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| property owners about this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| about 3 o'clock I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| another file, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| And so I said, okay, well surely it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| in here. And then when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| reviewed this, there are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| no certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| notices, mailings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| to the adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Now, in the second one I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| received this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| well there were some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| I guess they're calling them affidavits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| But there are some issues with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| too. And also keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| this commission on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| passed closing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| And that was on March 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| And then I looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| these, I guess, affidavits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| and they're dated like, here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| one, June 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| And it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| emphasizes the way these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| property owners are not understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| On this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| June 13th, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| the property owner says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| this right of entry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| is for trash removal only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| This is not consenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| to closing down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| Again, I hadn't had a chance to really review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| this yet, but that jumped out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| What also jumped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| out at me was, when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| looked at the names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| of the affidavits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| if you call them affidavits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| that are in this second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| file, there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| affidavits that I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| and you've got that, looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| again at the exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| the first pic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| and we talk about this, is that notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| And it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| with due process, constitutes due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| you've got to have notice and a meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| And so that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| you would think, that's the certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| mailing to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| owner saying, alright, we're thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| closing this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| That didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Pic 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| pic 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| pic 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| where the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| was blocked off on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| the Old Martin Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| Pike side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| the alarming thing about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| is, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| pics that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| where the road is blocked off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| has been blocked off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| since March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| So you've already closed this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| even though you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| hadn't had a second reading, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| the first reading didn't send out notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| So that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Then we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| pic 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| pic 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| pics show on the other end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| of Town Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| by the church, and you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| the barrier there. The road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| has been blocked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Again, the adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| weren't notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Then when you look at pic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| pic 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| pic 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| this is supposedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| what was dumped on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| the thing about this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| where this is dumped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| file that I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| two times today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| there is not a notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| notifying the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| it's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Howard, who owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| And yet, this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| So here are the issues, here are the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| No ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| closing this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| but this road has been closed now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| since before March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| I thought maybe you were closing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| on a temporary basis, maybe there would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| showing that you closed it on a temporary basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| And as I told you, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| clients, and her husband as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| says you can have access to it to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| And yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| when this was presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| back in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| for the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| represented that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| things dumped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| and if they were going to be cleaned up, you would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| by now, if you closed the road, they would be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| But if you will look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| you were provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| back in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| a visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| And it looks something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| it has pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| of what was dumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| And you've got, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| is before you passed on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| this closes this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| And yet, if you look at what I handed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| these same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| items are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| So they were never cleaned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| up, so you didn't close it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| And yet it's been closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| and it's been closed without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| procedural safeguards for property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| Even now, you still don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| the affidavits from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| property owners who are interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| Another thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| normally, when you're going to do a closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| you take a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| because you need that information in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| make a decision. You need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| the people who are most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| affected by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| are they for it or against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| So you take a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| and then you survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| all of the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| who are affected by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| and you have that piece of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| before you make a decision to close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| But when I looked in the file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| this morning, and when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| got the file this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| there is no survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| You were not provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| that information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| whether the property owners were for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| And yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| at your March 23rd meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| when it passed on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| all you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| from were people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| made it clear to you that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| opposed to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| No records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| in MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| no affidavits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| and so these are the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| I'm asking the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| and asking you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| reconsider, to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| don't second the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| or if you do, get it on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| a full vote, then to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Because the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| in this community are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| against this road closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| and those are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| some of the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| I've been able to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| in the last 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| and there are many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| But again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| Thank you, Commissioners, for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| consideration, and I ask that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| close this road, because the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| in this community are against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| this road closure. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Do I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5266)|
| 1:27:58| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Have we ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| got a bid on what the cleanup's going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Yes, sir. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| the cleanup cost is estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| I'm going to do this from memory, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| but I think it's around $85,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| So we're pretty close on our guesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| In regards to his questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| the closure of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| and I think he's referring to some city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| rules, I don't know that we have the same rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| and so do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| a requirement for a petitioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| to seek a road closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| that's affected by the road closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| If I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| Commissioner Anders, I would like to walk through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| a little bit, and what I'd like to do is separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| the policy question as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| or not the road should be closed, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| that's a question for this body that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| obviously is under deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| But I would like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| to the procedural aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| that we observe, and the procedural aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| that have been observed in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| just as a matter of professional pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Giving Mr. Underwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| the benefit of the doubt, obviously he hasn't had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| much time to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| I'd like to run through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| just so that both this commission understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| the procedures that have been observed, and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Underwood understands the procedures that have been observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| To begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Mr. Underwood referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| of entry for purposes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| cleanup and the affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| I'd want to clarify for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Underwood and this commission, those are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| separate documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| One of the reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| you may see one in a file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| and not in another is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| we do not have all of those signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| and back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Reference the affidavit itself, obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| he has some concerns about that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I'm certain that those could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| a subject of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| substantive and productive discussion, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| point out the affidavit was prepared by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| law director's office, not by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| We historically have not used affidavits of this kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| This was a new step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| that was added to the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| by the law director's office. We're very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| with it, but in terms of the content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| and form of that affidavit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| that was a product that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| came out of the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| and not Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| the original set of notifications went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| from solid waste, because you remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| the cause for the closure was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| chronic and habitual dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| So this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| understands, and for Mr. Underwood's benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| we will notify by certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| mail those parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| who own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| affected by the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| So if you have road frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| and your property abuts the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| you will receive certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| mail, and that was the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| here. For those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| that live on the road but do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| frontage directly abutting the closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| they're notified by the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| that are posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| in advance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| meeting that commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| So for everybody that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| ever travel on Twin Creek Road, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| not send them a certified letter saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| that Twin Creek Road is going to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| But if you do own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| we will send you a certified letter telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| you that Twin Creek Road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| the subject of this discussion and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| is going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| as far as our procedures go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| we actually had had discussion after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| this came up last time. We'd like to come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| chairman's briefing and walk you through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| and we'll do so in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| The last thing that Mr. Underwood mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| that I'd want to speak to was the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| nothing has been cleaned up. That, in fact, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| correct, and that has been our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| the entire time. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| abundantly clear from the discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| that we've had, we wanted to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| the issue of the cost of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| cleanup. We do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| those bids in, and then there'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| be a decision that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| will want to consult with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| In the event that the closure goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| forward, it would probably make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| for us to undertake an extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| cleanup to include property that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| outside the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| In the event the closure does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| go through, certainly we'd want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| to be good stewards, so we'd clean up that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| portion of the affected area that's within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| the public right-of-way, stake it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| and then work with the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| property owners to see about cleaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| their properties as best as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| helping them as much as we can within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| reason. But there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| limits to how much I should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| funds that constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| in Commissioner Carringer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| district or Commissioner Nystrom's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| have paid to use them to clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| private property in Commissioner Daley's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| district if we aren't able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| close the road and fundamentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| abate the problem. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| been our position from the start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| and I hope it continues to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| as I told Julian Harris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| we never lose sight of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| these are our constituents. We work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| parishioners that attend the church. We work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| for the people that drive up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Twin Creek. I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| that it has been so divisive, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| you look at the traffic counts, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| won't give you those from memory. You have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| and we can talk about them next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| From a standpoint of the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| value of Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| the numbers are so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| small, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| length of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| detour is so short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| that we continue to think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| an option that commissions should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| But again, that's with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| full respect for the fact that clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| there are folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| that are concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| We do want to come back to you at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Chairman's briefing, though, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| walk you through our process on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| closures, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| that, as a matter of professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| pride, we work hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| to make sure everybody that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| affected is noticed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| best as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Chairman Anderson, you stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| Last question is for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Do you feel comfortable with the process that you've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| as we move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| and we follow what we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| is the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| we originally had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| some of the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| have had adequate notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| as far as the topic goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| People in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| who are not directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| impacted and some that are directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| impacted. My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| is certified letters went out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| actual people who are impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| and that we have affidavits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| to give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| the right to close the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| for those who are adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| the road that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| to be signed by those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| those are the constitutional issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| survey is not a constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| requirement. Some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| other issues I heard, those are the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| ones and public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| is to give the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| an understanding of what is to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| and give them an adequate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| to prepare to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| and the public has been before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| this body on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| no less than two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| probably three occasions addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| The public is quite aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| and I don't remember the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| as Dwight was talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| about in terms of the traffic survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| There have been more people coming here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| to talk about it than probably use the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| I'm not real sure, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| I feel pretty comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| about what we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| once we had our conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Just for reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| the early numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| that's come in, the total labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| to clean all of Twin Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| what we call the hopper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| is $68,550.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| Disposal of tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| mixed garbage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| and tree removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| is another $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| Materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| erosion control, stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| asphalt, improvements to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| street lighting for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| improvements to Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| is another $14,300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| for a total of $115,977| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| $115,977.50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| That's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| And as we said in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| or as I have said in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| that I'm not willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| to spend $115,977.50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| $115,977.50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| to clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| a piece of private land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| We will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| clean the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| whatever that right-of-way may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| 15 feet, 20 feet from on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| each side of the road, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| do that. That will be done, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| we're not going to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| this problem of dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| of the tires and the refrigerators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| unless we close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| And again, I'm not willing to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| all this money on private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| if we're not willing to stop the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| in the beginning. The problem has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| stopped. There's been no more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| relief there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| So yes, it does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| As far as notices being given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| there was plenty of notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| It is an environmental hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| I'll have some more information next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| This is an environmental hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| to the community. We probably got 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| emails from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| overwhelmingly supporting the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| of this road. Now we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| mosquito season. We're in rodents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| We're in raccoons with rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| This is an environmental hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| We're not counting the 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| plus property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| down the stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| that are affected by Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| All this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| chemicals that are dumped in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| that we do not know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| that are under the mounds of tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| that are leaching into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Twin Creek downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| people are being infected downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Does the property need to be cleaned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| up? Absolutely. Am I going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| a hundred and some odd thousand to clean up a piece of private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| property? No. That will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| private property's owners to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| If there's chemicals there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| they will have the responsibility to clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| up the chemicals to do all the hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| It's not going to be Knox County's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| It will be the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| owner's problem in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| future to clean this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| If we do not fix the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| it's going to come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| haunt us again and we're going to be spending more and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| money. If this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| commissioner wants to clean up the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| and contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| the property owners and tell them that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| to clean up their dirty lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| that's fine. That's what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| will do. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| I do not see spending all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| money if we're not going to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| the problem in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| General Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| I've been to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| and walked it. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| one property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| own that entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| track of land where all the dumping is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| occurring? Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| defer to Jim on that, Commissioner. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| five affected property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| that abut the area of closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| In terms of what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Daley refers to as the hopper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| I don't recall whether the map split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| that and there's multiple owners or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| I'm going to ask Jim. He's done a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| of the deed research if he can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| The area of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| hopper where the dumping actually occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| how many property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| Just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| I guess the number of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| that the dumping is confined on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| appears to be primarily on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| properties, the property of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Howards and the property of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| Tools. So there are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| property owners that really the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| bulk of the dumping is contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Are they absentee owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Yes, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| only one individual that resides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| on the property between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| where the road's going to be closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| and the rest of them are absentee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| All where the garbage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| they're all absentee owners. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| only one owner that actually resides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| in the closed portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| when the fence was put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| and the fence got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| partially taken down, did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| one or both of those owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| request the county to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| reinstall the fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Let me check. We pulled up our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| work history on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6052)|
| 1:41:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| Actually, there was, it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| that there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| it looks like Mr. Harris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| even requested the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| on June the 6th of 2000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| where a tree had been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| had damaged the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| it says on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| closure comments, it says refer to John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| So I can't really necessarily speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| what John did, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Mr. Harris did call and advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| He wasn't the property owner, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| he was, I guess, the pastor of the church at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| Because it, I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| a mess. In fact, most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| I think this body has been to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| I'd just like to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| what, 30 or 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| years people have been dumping in this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| I want to make sure we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| that the community wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| the hundred plus thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| invested to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| There is plenty of opposition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| indicates they do not want this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| permanently closed. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| sometimes we have confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| road closure with a dump cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| We have a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| process under the county that we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| and can acknowledge. I don't know if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| was transferred accurately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| or correctly to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| so that they can understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| full fluidness of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| And even with the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| of the law director, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| like to just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| I understand the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| was given adequate notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| the properties along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| the road itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| And I know we specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| are talking about the two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| affected. But we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| talk about the people who live along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| that road. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| that is something separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| that we have to acknowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Because these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| are multiple issues to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Clean the dump up and open the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| but we in effect close the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| to clean the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| From what I heard from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| gentleman speaking, I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| we're clear if people are tuning in for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| first time or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Every time we've had a meeting, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| always had opposition. Every time we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| talked about this subject, we've had opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| So we're not trying, I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| anybody thinking we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| push something through without some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| opposition being there that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| discussed it. Also, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| Commissioner Schoonmaker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| most of us, if not all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| have walked this road, some of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| together. And we walked that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| with opposition as well as people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| that wanted the road closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| So we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| I think, really discussed this a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| with both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| And they've always been present when we've discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| I don't want anybody thinking we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| trying to just push this through without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| everybody having their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| There's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| quite a bit of property that we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| about with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| So I guess my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| these owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| could put this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| So how do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| there's quite a bit of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| that say they wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| subdivide it, say they wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| develop a subdivision or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| I've not looked at all of it, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| quite a bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| closing the road, are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| landlocking these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| owners into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| if they wanted to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| a half an acre to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| a relative or sell a half an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| for somebody to build a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| wondering, how does that go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| their future investments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Because there is some property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| as we all know, the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| Knoxville is growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| and becoming more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| vibrant. That's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| off one of the main roads. So I'm just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| what does that do to these property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| owners for their future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| Because property is always an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| generations that gets left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| That's a very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| When we look at early on, no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| is landlocked as a consequence of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| closure. In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| the majority of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| of the closure is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| 2 to 1 slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| It actually would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| not be a place that under the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| control and driveway design policy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| Knox County would be suitable or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| allowable for a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Everybody maintains access to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| So they'll still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| public road access. They simply wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| have it along the area front as they do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| But there are actually no existing driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| Those of you that started at the top of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| and saw the ravine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| obviously the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| viability of putting any kind of driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| access there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| pretty clearly limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| a question and I guess this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| involve the Health Department and Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| Is there any possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| if this is such that Carson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Daly says is an environmental hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| that the Health Department can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| force a cleanup and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| we can charge back the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| private property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I shouldn't speak for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| Health Department, Mr. Chairman. I could speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| to it from a zoning standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| We had talked about the possibility that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| if the closure does not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| forward, we'd want to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| So we would start by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| cleaning the area that's public right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| and then noticing the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| owners that they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| needed to consider cleanup efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| but giving them an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| say a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| with which to complete those because it's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| big and substantial expense as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| Commissioner Daly has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| referenced. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| for us as a governmental entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| we're prepared to take that on. But as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| private property owner, you start talking about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| cleanup cost that I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| know may nudge up against 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| percent or more of the appraised value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| property. That puts people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| a difficult position, so we'd want to give them a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| of notice. How the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| would approach it, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I just don't have any insight there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| to share with you. I just want to be very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| that we don't move down a slippery slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| where people that have problems allow that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| to grow, thinking at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| the county's going to come through and rescue me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Yes, sir. And again, that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| we don't want to set the precedent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| any kind of cleanup effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| If we haven't created conditions where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| the problem can't reoccur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Would you like your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Well, prior to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| this is private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| property. This is what's getting me right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| now. You're talking about private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| and this dumping's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Have we ever cleaned it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| before? Yes, sir. There have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| some various cleanup efforts in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| I can't give you a whole lot of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| on those, but there have. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| should mention, Commissioner Bussard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| that the right-of-way also needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| to be cleaned. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| wouldn't want to leave this commission with the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| that the area of right-of-way is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| pristine and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| adjacent private properties need cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| because that's not the case. The whole thing needs cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| We just thought it best to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| this question before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| The right-of-way on that road is how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| Do you know? Is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| to the edge of the asphalt or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| is it... Do you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| 15, 20-foot buffer or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| You know, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Twin Creek is such an old road, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| if Jim's familiar with it, but I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| be surprised if it's just outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| the edge of pavement. Our standard right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| would probably not apply to a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| that's this old. It may very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| be edge of pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| But if we go ahead and clean it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| up as Mr. Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| says and... Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| says and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| you leave the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| open, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| then it would become the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| Well, even now, it's probably the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| responsibility of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| in itself to have it cleaned up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| if people are illegally dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| on it. So it's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| responsibility to protect their own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| is what you're saying? Yes, sir. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| we just thought this was a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| approach to try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| the issues that are out there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| give the folks there that live some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| but have a permanent solution so that we're not simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| back every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| going through this exercise over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| But the problem if the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| department gets involved and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| call it a hazardous...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS180618?start=6616)|
