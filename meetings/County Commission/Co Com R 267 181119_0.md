| 0:07:36| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| I'd also now like to ask Commissioner Biggs to begin tonight's meeting with our devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| It is with honor that I get to introduce my friend to come and do the devotional tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| I've known Justin Pratt with Clear Springs Baptist Church for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| And I'm going to let Justin come to the podium for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Well, I'm certainly thankful for this opportunity to take just a moment to share a brief devotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| and take the time to pray for this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| It's been well documented and well said that if we don't learn from history, history is doomed to repeat itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| And in the Holy Scriptures, God gives us a word about the nation of Israel when the communities of that country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| particularly the tribe of Judah, was in a place of disarray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| As a matter of fact, there was a prophet during that time by the name of Isaiah who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| Judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth far off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| When you think about those words, what the prophet Isaiah is saying is that justice is turned backwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| righteousness stands afar off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| He goes on to describe that they were at a place in their communities in their country that there was no truth in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| As a matter of fact, the prophet offers this in Isaiah 59 verse 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| In Isaiah 59 verse 14 he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Yea, the truth is faileth, and that he that departeth from evil makes himself prey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| It seems anymore if we live in a generation where we do stand for truth and we do stand for righteousness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| and we do seek justice and equality that we do become the prey of many who do not seek that same standard and that same objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=541)|
| 0:09:09| But I'm reminded that in that particular time there was an evil king by the name of Manasseh who ruled with an iron thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| He began to turn the nation to idolatry and it got no better with his son Ammon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| But finally another little boy came along by the name of Josiah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| Josiah, in my personal opinion, is the greatest king that the nation of Israel, particularly the tribe of Judah, had ever witnessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Josiah, at eight years old, began to rule a nation. Our mind cannot even begin to fathom that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=572)|
| 0:09:39| But as Josiah began to rule that nation, the scripture says that it was in the 16th year, making him 24 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| that he began to literally overturn the tide of a nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| If you were to take the Bible and read 1 Kings chapter number 21 and 1 Kings chapter number 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| you'll find very clearly what Josiah did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| The first thing he did was a priest came to him and said, I found the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| And so instead of governing his nation on politics, he governed by principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| He stood for what the truth was, he stood for the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| And God, sovereign, to use this young king at 24 years old to turn a nation back to God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| There's a second thing that he did, and I'll close with this one, and that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Josiah was a man of the Bible said that when God saw that his heart was tender and that he prayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| God said, I heard your supplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| I believe that the thing that will turn our country and our nation back quicker than anything in the world, including our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| is when we value principles over politics and we value prayer over programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| I would close with these words, and I think that it's very fitting for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| And if you'd take just a moment to let me share with you, the date was September the 5th of 1774.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| Delegates from 12 of the 13 original colonies had gathered together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| at what we now have come to know as the First Continental Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| A man like Patrick Henry and John Jay and George Washington were at that particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| The meeting was very contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Historical records prove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| There was a young man there by the name of John Adams who wrote a letter to his wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| and he shared that it was contentious and they were very uncomfortable in that particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| His wife wrote back to him and a couple of days later they joined for the second meeting of that First Continental Congress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| and they commissioned a chaplain by the name of John Duchesne to lead in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| John Duchesne took his hand and laid it on the right hand of a man by the name of George Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| I share with you the prayer that he prayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Oh Lord, our Heavenly Father, high and mighty King of kings and Lord of lords,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| who dost from thy throne behold all the dwellers on earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| and reignest with power supreme and uncontrolled over all kingdoms, empires, and governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| We ask that you look down in mercy and we beseech thee on these American states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| who have fled from thee from the rod of the oppressor and thrown themselves at thy gracious protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| Desiring to be henceforth dependent only upon thee, to thee have they appealed for the righteousness of their cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| To thee do they now look for that countenance and support which thou alone can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| Take them therefore, Heavenly Father, in thy nurturing care and give us wisdom in this council and velour of field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| Defeat the malicious designs of our cruel adversaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| Convince them of the righteousness of their cause and if they persist in their purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| their own erring justice sounding in their hearts constrain them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| to drop the weapons of war from their unnerved bands in the day of battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Here's the part that I love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Be thou present, O God of wisdom, and direct this council of this honorable assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| Enable them to settle things on the best and surest foundation that the scene of blood may speedily be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=774)|
| 0:13:02| That order, harmony, and peace may be effectually restored and truth and justice, religion and piety prevail and flourish amongst the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=782)|
| 0:13:11| Preserve the health of their bodies and the vigor of their minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| Shower down on them and the millions that they represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| such temporal blessings as thou seest expedient for them in this world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| and crown them with everlasting joy in the world to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| All this we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus Christ, thy Son and our Savior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Father, we come bowed in your presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| And Lord, as John Duchesne prayed, we pray that as these honorable men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| serve this wonderful county that we get to call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| That God, you would always let them work in a spirit of unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| That God, you would allow them to work with the citizens of this county's best interest at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| May they, like King Josiah, who learned at a very young age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| that he was called into a position for such a time as this to serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| God, may we never forget that in John 13 you give us the greatest example of humility and service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=849)|

| 0:14:25| Lord, when Peter thought that that was unjust, you taught a valuable lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| And that is a lesson of humility and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| God, I pray that you would direct each of these commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| and the men and women who lead this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=875)|

| 0:14:41| as they seek what's best for the people of this city that we live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| and this county that we call our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=886)|

| 0:15:06| And all God's people said, Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=906)|

| 0:15:30| However, we have the scouts of Troop 757 here with us tonight visiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| I met their patrol leader and asked Davis if he would like to bring the scouts down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| So, Davis, would you please bring your patrol leader down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=946)|
| 0:16:13| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=981)|
| 0:16:34| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you, scouts, and thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| I know we have some folks, and I'm referencing scouts and other guests tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| So before we jump into tonight's agenda, I want to remind everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| scouts and as well as for our guests from Youth Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| By the way, would everyone from Youth Leadership Knoxville please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| This is a special program of Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| We have leaders from high schools all around Knoxville here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| They are part of a months-long program to help them meet other student leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| throughout the community and to teach them about leadership skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| and parts of our community that they might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| This is their second government meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| I believe they attended a city council meeting recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and I want to thank them for making the time to come join us here at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Prior to this meeting, they heard from our county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| as well as all of us on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| It's a great program that you're in, and thank you so much for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| So for our special guests from Leadership Knoxville, you all may sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| and for our scouts and other guests tonight, tonight's meeting is our formal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Last week we had a work session where we set our agenda and worked through a lot of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| So tonight you'll see us voting on some of these things in one large vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| after they've been read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| So just to let you know, that's kind of how it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Next on our agenda is public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| and I have several visitors who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| For our guests who are here to speak at public forum, you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| When you approach the podium, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| And the first person I'd like to ask to come visit is Ms. Sharon Smith with the Friends of the Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1097)|
| 0:18:26| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| My name is Sharon Smith, 3109 T Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you for the opportunity to come before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| and just to speak briefly about the Friends of the Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| and how we are advocates for our Knox County Public Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| We are so blessed in Knox County to have a wonderful library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Ms. Marita Black and her staff do an outstanding job of programming and services for our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| and we just think the world of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Just briefly, you do have an annual report in front of you that I've left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| and that just outlines some of the things that we do and that we sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| and I encourage you each to come and participate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| You do have a complimentary membership to the Friends of the Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| and we're so honored that you would participate with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Just briefly, the Friends of the Library's mission is to foster a love of libraries, books, and reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| in the Knox County area through community outreach, advocacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| and support of the Knox County Public Library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| I'm coming before you today just to ask for your continued funding and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| when you do your budgets in our community libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving, and please enjoy the desserts that we've brought for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Thank you, Ms. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| All right, next on our agenda for public forum is Mr. Herb Moncier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1195)|
| 0:20:05| To be brief, you have on your agenda a little later on the issue with regard to your hiring an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1205)|
| 0:20:14| I certainly hope that you all do that, because given an open-minded and non-biased attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1214)|
| 0:20:21| that will give us the opportunity to sit down and settle this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| It should be settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| I think we can settle it, but it's going to take two to dance and two to tango to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| And that's, of course, up to you all to give us someone that we can work with toward bringing this to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| If there are any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| I'll yield to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| I used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Oh, there is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Mr. Moncier, is the billing clock running tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| It's not running for us, but it's running for everybody else, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| But yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| All right, Al Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1272)|
| 0:21:19| To address your question, mine's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| And no one in my firm is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| I mean, basically, I just want to follow up on Herb's point, and I may do it quicker than he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| is if you give us an attorney to work with, I mean, there's a hearing scheduled the 28th next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| We would like the opportunity to, as Randy pointed out, stop all clocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| I think in one meeting, sitting down with this attorney, we could negotiate a deal and bring this to a totality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| and you all would not have any more public forums for me, Herb, or Steve and Garrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| which may be your biggest incentive not to go ahead and pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Mr. Steve and Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Steve and Garrett, 7838 Barker Road, Corrington, Tennessee, 37721.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| I appreciate the opportunity to address you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| My colleagues have already really spoken to what I would speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| I simply represented one of the individual deputies during these lawsuits, and I would just echo what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| But I did want to come up here specifically for the purpose of commending Commissioner Biggs for having my pastor come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| and deliver the invocation tonight, which I think he did an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Commissioner Smith has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| My clock is not running, if that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1371)|

| 0:23:39| Since the last time I spoke, there has been lots happening in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| A Supreme Court judge went through his hearing, and we in Knoxville have a toxic public health hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| I have come upon the discovery of a largely affected injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| that happens when the public comes into contact with a court system for abuse is rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1435)|

| 0:24:58| Now, I have 10 other Knoxville, Knox County citizens for you as well as my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| with some of these false charges by officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| The syndrome is usually triggered by confronting officials when you're within the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| and they don't have a legitimate charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| They make up one in retaliation so that to get, and some do it to get rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| I believe I have suffered from the mental injury of post-traumatic stress syndrome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and trigger of a previous post-traumatic stress syndrome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| I hope to be diagnosed with this legal abuse syndrome as I feel that I suffer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1534)|

| 0:25:48| and that I will be entitled to all the federal civil rights protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| and provide to me the support advocate and any other support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| The show that I am telling the truth and how it triggers the emotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| even using biofeedback, has allowed Dr. Karen Huffner and other official proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| She says, Perception is what lawyers do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| They create a perception to win for their client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| And since the terms, lying is powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| It comes into the picture, you bet, she says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| It seems like anything they need to do will create the perception, is more powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| So absolutely, it is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Post-traumatic stress order comes from feelings of helplessness jeopardized by the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1594)|

| 0:26:56| Under federal, Title II comes into play, so you are a little more empowered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| so you feel better in this courtroom, so you're able to function better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Under Title II, the County Commission meeting would fall under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1627)|
| 0:27:24| We have a reasonable expectation of honesty in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| I was hit and injured by Knox County Court, framed, ambushed, set up, kidnapped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| tortured, broken down, and forced to use a lawyer, forcibly guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| This evidence, and five or six departments were in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1659)|

| 0:27:47| and I have emailed some of the commissioners and the mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| about an advanced copy of last month's public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| I cannot attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| I will now read what I will probably be in a breeved version here at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| We are here to suggest that the county initiate, develop, implement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1682)|

| 0:28:17| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Next person is Tom Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Tom, if you could please approach the stand and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| My name is Tom Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| I live at 400 South Main Street, Suite L229, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| I'm a detective with the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| and I'm also a board member of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| Okay. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| I'm speaking for the FOP as a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| We support our retired officers having their legal fees paid by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| The reason for this is they did nothing other than retire in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| They served 25 years with our department with the promise that they would have a pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| and the pension was outlined and voted on in this body twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and then put on a county referendum, which was voted on by the Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| It was fixed a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| It went over through remandments, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| But overall, the person that wrote it even said in his statement to the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| that he wrote it the way he wrote it on purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| that the additional ALP days would be counted towards the outcome of their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1773)|
| 0:29:43| The lawsuit was brought against these officers who had already retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| did nothing wrong other than just retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| and they suffered not only financial problems but also emotional issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| having to deal with this for over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| wondering if they were even going to be allowed to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| after they had already been given the privilege of being able to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| The fees are almost $700,000 to my understanding at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| and probably going to go a little higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| How do you fix the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| I mean, I don't believe in bringing a problem without bringing a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| And the solution, as far as the FOP is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| is there's a discretionary fund with the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| and it's his discretion to bring a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| so why not use those funds to pay the $700,000 that he rang up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| that the chancellor basically told him in his decision he had no right to bring in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Why should Knox County taxpayers suffer this financial burden when he did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| it's his office, it's his financial discretionary funds that should be used to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| and if it's not enough, then defund his office and use those funds to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Why burden the Knox County taxpayers for a lawsuit that never should have been brought in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| We also would ask that you join us as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| The FOP plans on bringing a complaint to the Board of Professional Review against Mr. Armstrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| for the illegal or unethical acts of bringing a lawsuit in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| We're a little bit tired of the law director's office being at war with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| and the sheriff's office, and just as another example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| there was an article in the paper July 24th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| The title of the article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Knox County 2018 Salaries Database Shows Big Races for 15 Employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| One of those employees by Mr. Armstrong's own admission in the paper was a guy named Evan Hauser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Now, Mr. Hauser is over workman's comp cases for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| and according to the director's statement in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| Mr. Hauser got an $8,929 bump, which brought his salary up 8.2% to $117,694.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| The law director said he justified it based on job performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| because he saved the county $800,000 in workman's comp cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| He also saved Knox County School Board $500,000 in workman's comp cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Now, how do you perform this miracle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| It's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| You just deny everything, and the reason I know this, I was a victim of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| My partner was a victim of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Several other officers are a victim of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| My partner was denied medical benefits when he was driving a county car while working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| was involved in an accident that was not his fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| It was deemed the other person's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| The person ran through a red light and nailed him, and he was taken by ambulance to an ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| When he put in for reimbursement, he was denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| said that he was not on duty, even though he was driving a county car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| My medical benefits were denied under heart and hypertension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| even though that's a guaranteed medical benefit that the U.S. Supreme Court had already ruled on years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| that if you are a first responder and you develop heart and hypertension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| you are, it's already deemed by black-letter law, by the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| that it is a byproduct of being a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| I had worked 22 years as a police officer before developing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| and all I wanted was my medication paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| I actually got my card saying that my medical benefit, my pills would be paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| and after 60 days, Mr. Hauser reopened my case and denied it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| and my benefits were taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| I ended up having to file a lawsuit to get my benefits back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| for something that was guaranteed by the U.S. Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| I would ask that you help us defund the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| because it's unethical and probably illegal of just his acts he's been going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| These are just two examples of multiple across the county of workman's comp problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| That's your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| And Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2018)|
| 0:33:49| Keith Lyon, president of the Fraternal Order of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I want to talk to you a second about the human element of this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| These seven people who retired former police officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| they didn't retire at a six-figure salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| They're living on that pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| and consider the fact the cost of living has gone up 40 percent in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| That's not easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| And to give you an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| one of the people named in the lawsuit was also a widow of a member of the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2055)|
| 0:34:24| Her husband had passed away some time ago, almost eight years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| and she was still raising two young kids at the time by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| That's not easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Fast forward to today, she's handed a subpoena to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| you're being sued because of your benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| You know, think about those things for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| There's a human element to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Everyone's aware of the problems law enforcement's had across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| and Knox County is not immune to it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| To give you an idea of where we're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| 1992, a class at the Knox County Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| also a class at the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| averaged 3,000 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Fast forward to today, we're down to 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| That's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| We need to think about these solutions for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| instead of penalizing people who's already worked, put in their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| and trying to live the rest of their life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| because the average lifespan of a police officer that retires is only 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| Just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| Okay, this concludes the public forum part of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| What I'd like to do is, while on our agenda we have honorary resolutions is the next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| but then we do have later on in the agenda, we do have to actually add this honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| So if it pleases this body, I think this is the second time that's actually happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| where we've had to add an honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| If it pleases this body, the chair would like to move item F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| which is amendments to the agenda, to right now just so we can quickly get this added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| so that we can, frankly, properly honor Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| and get our agenda set for tonight's meeting, if it pleases this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| And I'm seeing all yeses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| We have one, two, three, four items to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| Three of those are related to Commissioner Wright, primarily housekeeping related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| One is about the matter with hiring an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| What I'd like to do, as three of those are all related, is to see if it pleases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| I'd like to do one vote just to add all those to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| So with all that said, it's items 1, 5, 49, and 52 are to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2211)|
| 0:37:00| Item 54 is our zoning agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| That is an item that will be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| We do have two withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| The withdrawals are item 43 and item 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2233)|
| 0:37:22| Has everybody got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| What were your adds again, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| It was item 1, 5, 49, and 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| Make a motion to add what needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Repeat what needs to be deleted and postpone what needs to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| I'm going to call that a motion to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| It's been made by Commissioner Anders and it was seconded by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| There's a motion that is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Setting the order, I think we should probably do the spreader record for him resigning before we honor him for his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| That sounds appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| That would be item number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2291)|

| 0:38:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Could we move item number 51 right behind the honorary resolutions, which is the presentation from AMR Rural Metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2300)|
| 0:38:31| I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| That would be, we'll go from recognizing Commissioner Wright to doing the briefing item 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Just to say that back, that seems right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2324)|

| 0:38:58| The motion that is before us is to set our agenda based on the items that the Chair has brought up, the adds, deferrals, and withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2338)|
| 0:39:06| Two changes in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| One is to do the spreader record for Commissioner Wright's resignation, which is item number 5, before item 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2348)|
| 0:39:16| which is our opportunity to recognize Commissioner Wright for his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| And then we will move item 51, which, and I say thank you, Chief Harnish, for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| we'll move the Rural Metro update to follow the honorary opportunity for Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| Are we all on the same page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2382)|

| 0:43:45| Okay. The Chair will entertain a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Mr. Chair, I want to take this time and to be my honor to recognize Dave Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| and to suggest that we accept this by acclamation, this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2635)|

| 0:44:06| and seconded by Commissioner Gill. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2646)|

| 0:44:12| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Dave, please join us. I'm going to come down there and meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| But before I do, I want to tell you all, I remember right after I was elected to County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| yet before I was sworn in, I had a cheeseburger with Commissioner Wright down at Linton's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| And I look back at how grateful I was for your insight to serving on Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| how grateful I was for your service, and it was very impactful for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| And after I got elected Chair, don't tell anybody it's a secret between me and the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| I even went back and listened to some of your meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| So we're just so grateful for your service, and this is an absolute honor to be able to recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| I want to share with my fellow commissioners, we had a special plaque made for Representative Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| This is actually the gavel that he used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| So this is a special plaque for Commissioner Wright as a thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2703)|
| 0:45:15| Please go ahead and share some words, and I'll bring your certificate to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2715)|
| 0:45:27| I still want to say it this way, my fellow commissioners, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| if you look at the meetings of Knox County Commission, Brad, you'll have to vouch for me now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| if I'm standing here, it's because it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| And tonight is really important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| I believe I arrived at County Commission during a time of controversy and turmoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2754)|
| 0:46:03| Commission was being, trying to implement term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| Then it had to implement downsizing, and right in front of that was Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| and I'll come back to that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| And I am leaving Knox County Commission in a time of turmoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2783)|
| 0:46:33| But in the middle of all this, I've got a few notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| In the middle of this, in the 8th District, there's been library expansions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| senior citizens worked on and built, senior citizen centers worked on and built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| convenience centers built, updated, traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| There's been hundreds of things that have worked out in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| It's because Knox County sat, deliberated, heard good cause, and acted for me appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2821)|
| 0:47:18| I have to pause for just a second and think again of the pastor that was just here at the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| to raise a prayer for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| He's prayed over me before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| But it's through those organizations in the 8th District, churches, civic groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| just regular old groups of people at Republican clubs that have allowed the representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2858)|
| 0:47:48| to come out of the 8th District, and it's not just been me over the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| I sat right there on the end of large commission with Phil Ballard, my friend Bud Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2876)|
| 0:48:06| An even more important team member, I guess, out of the 8th District when it comes to Carter Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| and Gibbs Middle School is Mike McMillan, member of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| And then also I'd like to say everlasting and sometimes friendship that they don't know that they've given me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2900)|
| 0:48:30| as in former County Commissioner Jack Huddleston and former member of the Board of Education Steve Hundley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2910)|
| 0:48:40| It's taken all of the work of the 8th District to get those folk into this room and for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| the groups that I've named, to encourage your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| And again, I thank Knox County Commission especially for Carter Elementary School and Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| And I'd be remiss in saying that today's been hectic for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Lunchtime was with the Knox County delegation, which is going to Nashville tomorrow to Carcass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2945)|
| 0:49:16| My good friend and now Congressman Tim Burchett was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| and it's only through the collaborative effort of commission and the mayor that the things that I have spoken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2961)|
| 0:49:31| have been accomplished in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| It's been my heartfelt thanks to you all today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2974)|
| 0:49:40| I do want to ask you for one thing, something I forgot to do as my last official act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2980)|
| 0:49:49| I'd like for you all to consider making out of your discretionary money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| funds available to honor air, to support a veteran, to visit Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=2995)|
| 0:50:06| And the next to last thing I'd like to say thank you for is I want you to come out here with me and have a class picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3006)|
| 0:50:19| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3019)|

| 0:56:15| Sorry, I didn't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Our Vice Mayor Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Next on our agenda as we, oh, and I see Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you, Sheriff Spangler, so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| So next on our agenda, when we set it, we were moving item 51 up to right now, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| going to be a community update from our partners at Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| My name is Chris Blatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| I'm the Regional Vice President of AMR Rural Metro here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3413)|
| 0:57:00| I'm here to address the 10140 Gallows Point Drive, Knoxville 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| Thank you for allowing us to come here today and for the honor of serving the people of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Rural Metro Fire Chief Jerry Harnish and I are pleased to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| You have before you our 2018 annual report, which outlines some of our accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| For both AMR, our ambulance service, as well as Rural Metro Fire, which provides fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| here in Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| Chief among them is that we responded to over 100,000 requests for service for EMS and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| More than 44,000 of those resulted in patient transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| In addition to our EMS resources, we have trained paramedics on board our fire units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| who responded to medical emergencies within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| There were over 16,000 Rural Metro Fire responses last year and about 70% of those resulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| in or were as a result of medical emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| We also want to tell you about all our community service we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| It's a critically important part of what we do, although it generates no income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| Before I tell you about some of that, I need to point out that we couldn't accomplish anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| in this report without our outstanding people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| We have over 550 paramedics, EMTs, firefighters, and support staff here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| And they're where the rubber meets the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| They're hardworking, dedicated, compassionate, and in many cases award winning for what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| We appreciate their dedication and professionalism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| And they don't just help people here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| From local crises like the Gatlinburg fires to hurricanes that hit the southeast, we respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| And frankly, it's a great team effort by all first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| We do a great deal of community education as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| In the last year, we trained more than 3,000 Knox citizens on how to stop the bleed if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| there was a mass shooting in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| Additionally, how to give pediatric and adult CPR and other skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| All told, we donated nearly 1,300 hours of time to community events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| And that is in addition to our own programs that I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| Again, thank you for letting us serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| And Jerry and I are here to answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Yeah, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Thank you guys for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| I've kind of started looking into just kind of recently at work the transport for forensics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| that you guys are having to perform inside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| And we're going to look at the contract, just kind of let you know, 1,200 transports just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| for forensic body count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| And it's in the contract that they're not to be paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| But what it has become is burdensome to crime scene technicians and families of leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3618)|
| 1:00:26| bodies at scenes longer than we should have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| Could you clarify for everyone here exactly what a forensic transport is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| It could be any kind of dead person transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| And so they wait on the medical examiner's office to call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| It's called a BLS transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| And the difficulty is they can't transport BLS, which is not emergency transport, unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| they have four ambulances available for an ALS emergency call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| And so with some of the things that are occurring in ERs with the backups of the ERs and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| that are occurring with crime scenes, it's causing a sometimes very long wait for families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| and investigators to have bodies removed from crime scenes or just normal death scenes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| And so we're going to look at that, kind of give you, try to find a way to give you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| relief on that, because it has become burdensome to the organization and also to the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| And I think we need to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| So thank you guys for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Chief Harnish, I might have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| I've gone to a lot of church events, community events, things with kids, things with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| And frequently, I see some of your staff there either often with one of the ambulances, kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| of doing community outreach, talking about what y'all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| I don't expect you to have that number off the top of your head, but I would be curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| about the amount of community outreach that y'all do just to share people's safety tips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| If you could please take just a moment to give us an update on some of those items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| And no, I don't have those numbers on the top of my head, but it's several thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| contacts every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| Actually, this represents insight on Knox County's part, because Knox County funds two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3731)|
| 1:02:20| full-time public fire educator positions that we staff and are overseen by the county fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| And that sounds rather mundane compared to the excitement of emergency response, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| the reality is Knox County is a very, very safe community to live in, and it's largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| been because of the progressive attitude towards what can be done to educate the public and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| reduce fires and other emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| To the point that if Knox County were an average community in the United States, it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| expected to have lost six people in the last two years who would have died in fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| We have had no deaths in the last two years due to fire in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Chief Harnish, I saw something on the news the other day, a report about wait times at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| the hospital and how it's holding up ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| I know our hospitals are doing the best they can, but how much of a burden is this placing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| on you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| How much hold time are we losing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Let me let Chris answer that, because my information is a few years old, but it's hurtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3808)|
| 1:03:37| So probably over the last three weeks, it's really increased dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| Last week we had offload delays at various emergency departments that lasted up four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| to six hours at times before we get our units clear of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| So basically when we transport a patient to the emergency department, we can't leave until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| we transfer care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| So at times it's taken up to six hours to transfer care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| I just want to, I do have a question, but I also want to just commend you all for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| accessible and engaging with us as leaders of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| I recently had a constituent issue that was resolved very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| I know you took personal care in that, and I would just welcome that anybody who wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| to connect with you all, you are very quick to answer, engage, be of service to whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| needs it, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| In Knox County as it is growing, what is the biggest challenge you have, and what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| the biggest opportunity to serve the people of Knox County as you see it from your perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| in emergency services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| That's a good question, because while growth also presents more people requiring care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| it also increases the strength of the economy, and it's the strength of the local economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| that provides the funding for fire protection and other emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| So I would say the biggest challenge is that we welcome new people to the community, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| they often come in from delivery systems that are provided for them totally at the expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| of the public, and then when they're confronted with a system like we have in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| it could be a serious lag in time before they realize that they have any personal responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3932)|
| 1:05:40| in providing for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Obviously, it's not hurting the quality of service, but it's a challenge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| I'd like to add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| We're actively recruiting for our 2019 Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| A number of the photos in the report were actually taken at the 2017 Academy, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| you look very carefully, you might recognize some of your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=3964)|

| 1:07:17| If I can just, from the EMS perspective, Commissioner Jay, our greatest challenge is there's a nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| shortage of EMTs and paramedics, and what we're doing to correct that, we're holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4044)|

| 1:10:29| All right, motion approved by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| All right, all opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Next, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| Okay, do we have a, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Yes, I'd like to make a statement and then make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| I didn't quite hear, I'm sorry, Randy, I didn't hear exactly what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| I'd like to make a statement and then make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Okay, Commissioner Smith has said he'd like to make a statement and then make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| While researching the charter and the pension plan a couple months ago, I found under Section 3.08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| commission is supposed to approve the law director's budget related to outside legal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| I've spoken to both the law director and finance director, and they agree and are aware of this oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| I would like to commend the law director for doing an excellent job of keeping his expenditures low during his budget tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4282)|
| 1:11:35| He has made this a priority in his paying off for all of us at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| However, I would like to defer this line item transfer for 30 days until we get guidance from the chancellor on payment related to the officer's legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4300)|
| 1:11:49| So I would like to make a motion that we approve the first five line item transfers and postpone this one for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Okay, a motion has been made by Commissioner Smith, and I heard it out of my left ear, it was seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| Okay, we have a motion, proper motion, and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| Is this a problem for Mr. Caldwell, the finance director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| Mr. Caldwell, name and address for record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| No, this is an FY19, so 30 days would not hinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| And, Chris, if you would take a moment to explain the org codes for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| You would do a much better job than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| The what now? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| The org codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| So the one that's in question, which you would have before you, is moving funds from 266, which is an internal service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4363)|
| 1:12:54| which is a risk management fund, over to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| And so the actual expenditure amount and the budget amount is $650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| What you will see on the transfer will look like $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| That's because in order to keep our funds balanced, we've got to move not only the expenditure side, but the revenue side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| So the expenses, just to overkill a little bit, always have, again, with a five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| And so you'll see five threes and five fours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| And then the revenues always begin with a four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| So that's the total, 1.3 to 1.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| That will move the budget only, if we do this in a month, that will move the budget over from 266 to 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4407)|
| 1:13:38| Then we will then do a general entry, moving expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| And if you would, please explain the difference in the budgetary process between an internal fund and. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| So Commissioner Smith brought this to my attention and the law director's attention a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| I can't remember now when it was exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| And what he says is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| And we had many years ago, not many, but a few years ago, probably before my tenure began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| we had moved that from 101 over to 266 to align it with general liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| which is where some of those expenditures come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| So that's why it was moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| The problem with that is internal service funds are not approved by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Those are non-budgeted funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| It ranges from a vehicle service center to health insurance to risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| And so it was done in what we thought made sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| and then hadn't really thought about it anymore until he brought this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| And so all we would do is move those expenses over with the budget once that gets complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| And then as we move ahead in fiscal year 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| I will work with Law Director Armstrong as we prepare a budget for said account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4492)|
| 1:15:00| And, again, I'd like to add that the law director was very cooperative in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| and has done an excellent job of maintaining low outside council expenses during his tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| Commissioner Gallo, I saw your light flash on for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| He answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| It's all clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=4518)|

| 1:32:59| You're a pass on that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| could you please note the record that Commissioner Buster was a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| This is written to direct the Chair in consultation with the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| to bring a recommendation to this Commission and for this Commission to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| Over the last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| and I want to thank all of you for adding this to the agenda so that we had put in the spirit of productivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| I spoke with the Mayor twice on this and spoke to several different attorneys in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| I'd like to make a recommendation to this Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| and while we're here, just go ahead and just approve this so we don't need to put it on the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| that we approve the hiring of Arnett, Draper, and Haygood to represent this in this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| Let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| When I researched some of the law firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| they had just recently handled a fee dispute issue before federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| Their lead attorney on that was Jay Mater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| and he had two weeks ago been handling a matter similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| which spoke to their favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| They also have on their legal team Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| Rob Frost, he's been in our shoes before as a former city councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| and he is currently the attorney for the Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| So I figured he kind of understood where we were coming from on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| So based on, A, their experience in matters similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| and, B, kind of understanding the nuances of working in this type of setup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| they were the firm that I, at least based on my reviews and speaking with the Mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| that I wanted to bring to this body for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| I'm going to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| It says subject to approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| Subject to approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| So I guess the right thing to do as chair, I don't want to bring a motion before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| but I'd like to ask for someone to make a motion that we can vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| just to hire Arnett, Draper, and Haygood on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| The motion has been made by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Is there a proper second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Then we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| Second has been made by Commissioner Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| and I see the light on from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| This is a procedural statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| So once we approve that, what would be the process at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| Do you need a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| I'm sorry, I'm just unfamiliar with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| Do you need a resolution before we could actually approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| I know this is unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| and I'm struggling with the appropriate language to help define what this process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| So the committee made the recommendations with the mayor's office to hire this firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Well, the resolution before us is to allow the chair to work with the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5748)|
| 1:35:57| to pick a law firm to work on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| I did a little homework this week just to try and get ahead of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| and hope, frankly, that we could get this passed based on the research that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| And while we're all here together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| and certainly if this body would like to wait a couple of days and then weigh in on it on the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| that's the discretion of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| But that was the firm that I found based also on their hourly rates, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| One of the firms I looked at was substantially higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| and they had rates that were reasonable for a matter such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| and wanted to bring that before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| So now we've got a few lights, and I've been looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I don't know what order the lights came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| I'll go ahead and start with Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| So my question is, this is to seek legal counsel for us to figure out who pays the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5803)|
| 1:36:53| for the ruling of Chancellor Weaver or the legal fees that have been accrued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| instead of us just going ahead and saying it comes from X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| Just to kind of clarify on this a little bit, big picture, especially for our guests in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| there's a hearing on the 28th that there's already been paperwork filed by the plaintiff's attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5831)|
| 1:37:19| to seek payment of their legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Knox County is not represented in that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| Try to imagine walking into a courtroom where there's a desk that you're supposed to have Knox County represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| and we do not want to not have an attorney representing Knox County in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| However, the judge may rule on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| We cannot have an attorney not representing our interests just to either review the hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| or just even to represent us in the proper process of going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| So this matter is really just to hire an attorney to represent Knox County in the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| which is on the 20th, and I don't know the exact time, but I know it's the 28th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| Does that help a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| A little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| My main question is, since the county commission didn't bring this suit, we're hiring an attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| I'm just trying to wrap around it because I don't know if we remember last week at workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| whenever I stated that who brought the suit too should be the one to pay, and I still stand by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| That's the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| The commission had nothing to do with this lawsuit, nor did the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| So we're going to seek outside counsel and rack up a legal bill for us to see who pays the legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5911)|
| 1:38:40| Well, ultimately, this is already before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| There's going to be a hearing with or without us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| That's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| That's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| And the judge said that Knox County's law department cannot be there to, and I'm paraphrasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| but basically that the Knox County law department cannot represent us in this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| We need to make sure that Knox County has at a minimum a lawyer to represent us in that hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| That's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| So because the law director's office has a conflict of interest with representing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| we have to hire outside legal representation for this one specific meeting or for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| My hope is that it will probably be a one and done type of engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| And it has nothing to do with the merits of the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| It's literally just a stewardess through that particular hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| And you saw the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| Okay, I think Commissioner Busler, and then is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| I'm sorry, is the law director at your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Okay, go ahead, Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| I'll just try to help Commissioner speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| The law director was not conflicted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| This body voted to take the case, and this body voted to have the law director withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=5997)|
| 1:40:06| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| The case was dismissed by order of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| There's a pending motion made by the defense counsel for outstanding attorney fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| Because the Knox County law director has been directed by this body to withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| we can't represent you because you've asked us to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| You have one of two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| You can make a motion to have the law director's office represent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| You can hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| But I cannot make a notice of appearance as the law director in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6041)|
| 1:40:48| because I have been directed not to be in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Does that include your staff or just you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| It includes the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| The office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| So you would have to hire outside legal counsel for us, correct, or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| I can't do anything with this because you all have asked me to be out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| I'm only advising you about the resolution you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| The resolution you have is to hire legal counsel to represent you in the fee hearing on the 28th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6070)|
| 1:41:19| and or, depending how you amend this motion, to negotiate on behalf of you to settle the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6079)|
| 1:41:27| or whatever it is you want this to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| But you need to give direction with specificity to whoever you hire to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| as to what you're giving them the authority to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| So whenever that comes down, it would mean where those funds come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| whether it's our budget, your budget, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| That's not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| So what the motion is before us is to hire a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| But we haven't made any decisions amongst this body of what that lawyer is going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| or how he's going to speak for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| That being the case, I'm going to pass on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Commissioner Gitt and then I recognize Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| So I just want to offer some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| So we're at the stage of hiring an attorney that you reference a fee structure, which is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6150)|
| 1:42:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| Next to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6168)|
| 1:43:03| The fee structure, and I could get this on the forum, would be hourly rates would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6183)|
| 1:43:14| Jay Mater, $240 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| Rob Frost, $220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| And Paul Weimaier for $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6197)|
| 1:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Those are three separate lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Three separate lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| It will probably have a little something to do with based on their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| I know Commissioner Busser is going to pass on this, but he did bring up a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| And that is, what are we going to direct this attorney to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| And are we going to set a limit on how much and for how long we are going to retain them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| I think that's all appropriate for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Smith brought out the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| And also, was this the recommendation from the mayor's office as well as commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6241)|
| 1:44:09| The mayor and I discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| And we looked at about four or five law firms that we reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| And this was the one that, based on everything, seemed to be the best value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| and the best most experience that was related specifically to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| So with three different attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| do three different attorneys in terms of this resolution have three different assignments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| You know, I don't know the nuances of how that gets worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| but I'm guessing in a lot of legal matters you tend to have someone who's more of a courtroom lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| and someone that might be better at pushing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| I couldn't tell you how that would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Is this specifically for the hearing only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| Yes, specifically for the hearing and to represent our interest in the hearing matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| looking at the legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| Can I ask a question of the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| So your recommendation would be, as we move to the hearing on the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| the county commission does need representation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| To represent the commission regarding the payment of the attorney's fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| What is before the court is the group of defense attorneys who represented some of the retired officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| They have fees that are outstanding that are normally paid by the client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| They are requesting Knox County to pay those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| They have a motion before the court to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| They brought a proposed resolution last week of about $190,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6356)|
| 1:46:05| and said that was subservient to the amount they've actually earned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| but that was brought before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| What I'm trying to say is, number one, if you want to hire Arnett, Draper, and Haygood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| hire Arnett, Draper, and Haygood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| and the maximum hourly rate would be $242,200 for specific attorneys to provide this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6382)|
| 1:46:32| Then you want to add into your motion what is it you want them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| Are you wanting them to negotiate in good faith to settle this case before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6399)|
| 1:46:46| I mean, it's been alluded to by the defense that they would like to have someone to negotiate with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| and then you have to give them an upper limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| This is very difficult because you have to do it in open court, and they already know what the game is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6418)|
| 1:47:06| Another way you could do it is you could, well, I don't, I can't figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6426)|
| 1:47:13| There is another way, but I don't really want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| Can I ask you a quick question of the law director while he's pondering that thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| Could you instruct the legal counsel to negotiate on behalf of the best interest of Knox County to mitigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6440)|
| 1:47:33| could you sort of give them a direction of get the best deal so you're not setting a cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| By the way, Commissioner Jay, if you don't mind, wait until I recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Sorry. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| All right, because we also have another light from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| The reason I brought up that point before is you're going to be sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| you're going to be discussing what our interests are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| and there sits the people that you're going to be negotiating against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| That's why I didn't bring up any information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| So whatever we do right now, we're going to shoot ourselves in the foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| and our negotiation side is at a weak point right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| So, therefore, that's why I was going to pass, and that's why I asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| what is our position, what are we asking for, and what do we want to negotiate on our side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| But we can't discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Again, it puts us in a weak position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| and that's what this commission has done is put itself in a weak position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| Back to you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6522)|
| 1:48:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Go ahead, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| I have a potential question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| Number one, you'd have to pass a resolution to allow the law director to represent you in this matter, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| Number two, you can direct the law director to hire Arnett, Draper, and Haygood on your behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| to represent you in this hearing, number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| And then, as law director, we can negotiate in good faith on behalf of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| as the elected official without disclosing what limits you're willing to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| You just give the law director the power to set the limit on your behalf with these attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6571)|
| 1:49:38| And then they go negotiate in good faith, and I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| Otherwise, you're going to have to maybe, you may be able to, this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6582)|
| 1:49:52| you're going to have to be able to set some kind of limit to your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| You're going to have to have some way to give your attorney what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| is your top limit as to how far you're willing to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| And to do that as an elected body, you have to do it in the sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6605)|
| 1:50:11| Otherwise, you're going to have to direct somebody to do it on your behalf, maybe the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| You can give the mayor the authority to hire on your behalf and give him the authority to set the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6616)|
| 1:50:24| I should make a motion for the law director to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| I'm not conflicted other than the point is you have removed me from the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| And the court has already ruled that I'm not conflicted in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| So I'm just trying to help you find a way to get Arnett, Draper, and Hagood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| and then let them be able to negotiate in good faith on your behalf with some reasonable limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6642)|
| 1:50:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| I was looking at the law director and there's two lights that have come on over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| Which one came on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| Okay. Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Well, I mean, I understand what everybody's point is making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| but I don't think when we hired outside counsel to bring this lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| we didn't set a limit, obviously, because it's up around a couple of $700,000 or $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6668)|
| 1:51:15| So I get what everybody's saying, but it is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| We're hiring, potentially hiring, Draper and Arnett to represent the Knox County as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6681)|
| 1:51:30| not just us, but as the mayor's office, because I believe the chancellor ruled that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| we are the representatives of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| And so we obviously know that going into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| the potential is there for us to possibly pay these legal fees at that hearing on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| And really what we talked about last week was do we want to make sure those legal fees are proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6708)|
| 1:51:56| and I believe that that's what the judge is going to be asked to look at on the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| And so we're really, we're over, we're not hiring them to go past the 28th, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| I think we could probably go in the door and the judge is going to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| and have the clerk and master look at the fees and determine a fee scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| and then we've got to come back the next month and determine how we're going to pay that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| Essentially, that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| And so I think we're overthinking this, we're overcomplicating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| This is a simple hearing to determine what the fees are, and if the judge says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| Knox County, you pay them, then next month we come back and transfer the funds to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| If he doesn't say to pay them, then we have another discussion as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| whether we think it's right for us to bring suit against our employees and not pay their legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| I would argue that it's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| And so I think we're overstating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| We just need to set an hour limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| I don't know if it's a 20-hour limit or if we want to let Bud oversee that conversation with Draper and Haygood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6772)|
| 1:53:01| I'm okay with that, but we're overcomplicating this simple measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| This is just a hearing to determine the fees, if they're approved by the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| and if he says, Knox County, you're paying them because you brought the suit, then we'll pay them next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| I think that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| I think we're just overstating the obvious here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| Commissioner Gill has spoken before, so I don't think he's spoken on this matter yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| So I want to give you a chance to weigh in, and then I'll go to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| And we're talking about the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| And last month there was a proposal before this body to accept fees for these retirees of $50,000 to be capped at $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6819)|
| 1:53:51| Now, 30 days later, it's four times that amount, almost four times that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| It's 60 or 90 days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| It's not 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| Well, it was brought to us last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| It was two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| I was still chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| It wasn't last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| So it's gone up in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| It's almost quadrupled in price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| I would like the language in the resolution to make sure we have legal representation on behalf of our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| to really be part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6873)|
| 1:54:42| What is before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| I want to get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Let me restate the agenda item that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| The thing that's on our agenda, and this can certainly be modified if this body so desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| is consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6897)|
| 1:55:05| directing the commission chair in consultation with the mayor to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| and recommend an attorney to represent Knox County in the pending attorney fee dispute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6909)|
| 1:55:14| before the court in the lawsuit name, Knox County Chancery Court, Docket 19562-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6914)|
| 1:55:24| and to bring said recommendation to the full commission for its approval pursuant to Section 3-08D of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6924)|
| 1:55:33| That specifically is what is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| If this commission wishes to modify that, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| As I've said, I just want to make sure, as we go into that hearing, I do not want to have the Knox County table unoccupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6942)|
| 1:55:51| I also want to remind everyone, as we were discussing this at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| this particular thing was actually a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| It was a combination, I think, of Commissioner Anders and our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| who said a resolution like this might accomplish what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| So that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| We've talked a lot of good ideas here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| But I do want to begin to get some feel from this commission on exactly what we would like our final version of this resolution to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6970)|
| 1:56:20| So I think I'm holding the motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| So I'd like to clarify the motion to hire, I don't know what all the names were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6984)|
| 1:56:32| Arnett, Draper, and Haygood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Arnett, Draper, and Haygood, to represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| Knox County Commission, Knox County, or Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| Knox County, actually, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| But allow the law director to make sure that their timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| I don't know what we're trying to control here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| Is it the time spent or capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| Are we talking about the amount we spend or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| No, what really, what I was opening it up for is negotiation for a settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| But if you're just wanting to hire them to go to court and let the judge decide what's fair and reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7026)|
| 1:57:13| then you may want to amend the motion to allow the law director to hire Arnett, Draper, and Haygood to represent Knox County on the fee issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7033)|
| 1:57:22| scheduled on this date and this time at hourly rates commensurate with 240, 220, and 200, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7042)|
| 1:57:33| And then I can go ahead and do that on your behalf and give them a charge of reasonableness and settlement and talk to them about your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7053)|
| 1:57:44| And then they will go represent you independently of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| I will just talk to them about your resolution and what their charge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| And they will go do whatever happens in the court will be what happens in the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| and they will bring that back, and it will be an order to be administered, and we'll bring that back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7078)|
| 1:58:07| So the motion would be to hire, have the law director hire Draper Haygood to represent Knox County in negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7087)|
| 1:58:15| and or the court proceedings in regards to these officers, these fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| Okay, that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Okay, the motion has been made by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| For our clerk's office, I know you all have been writing this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Is that perfectly clear what we've heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| Your light's still on, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| I have one last question for the law director, because the language then would be to hire this law firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| so the negotiations would return to the law director's office, then return to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181119?start=7136)|
