| 0:02:44| I want to start tonight by recognizing a key member of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| who is retiring this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Housing and Neighborhood Development Director Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Becky, raise your hand so we all can see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| Tonight is Becky's very last city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| after more than four decades dedicated to affordable housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| Becky worked for 31 years with KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| before starting her second career with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| In just the last five years under Becky's leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| the city has added approximately 1,000 new affordable housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| and hundreds more are under construction right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| It is safe to say Becky's work has been transformative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| for thousands of families and for all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| We will celebrate Becky more later this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| but right now I would like to ask Director Wade to stand and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Becky, you are really doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=216)|
| 0:03:56| We're really going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| You've done a great job and an amazing amount of competence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| and experience and expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| and we're just really grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| Next I want to talk to you all, share a little bit of news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| in case you all don't know about the upcoming holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| We have the Fourth of July coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| and we are coming back to having Festival on the Fourth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| returning to World's Fair Park this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| complete with fireworks and the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| This is the first time we've had the full shebang since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| So this family-friendly fun kicks off at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| and will conclude with fireworks around 9.35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Throughout the day there will be live music, food vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| miniature golf, paddle boats, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Remember this event is rain or shine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| I'm looking forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| I just want to remind people, Chief Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| are fireworks legal in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| No, they are not unless it's a professional display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Unless you have a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| If you are from the city of Knoxville, your fireworks are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| Okay, thank you for that reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| But everyone can come out and enjoy the official city of Knoxville fireworks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| and that is going to be on the actual Fourth of July, Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| not Sunday, Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Finally, a quick reminder about our rules of decorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| or during public forum should sign up with the city recorder ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Please do not use profanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| And when speaking to specific agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Those who fail to adhere to those rules may be ruled out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| For those who are listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| please note that you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Thanks in advance for everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| And that concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Are there any reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I just wanted to let everyone know that I heard from Council Member Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| that she has a family emergency and will join us as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| The KTA board met this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| and CAT went through a Federal Transit Authority audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| and completed that with zero findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| So good on the CAT administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| And not so good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| We have a shortage of drivers for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| And so due to that shortage, CAT is meeting on July 7th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| to consider a temporary reduction in service line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Again, it's not a funding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| It's not a budgetary restraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| It is just the lack of drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| And so they have staffing challenges like the rest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| and the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| So it's unfortunate, and they are to be temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| But if you want to hear about the considered reduction in service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| there's a special meeting on July 7th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=416)|

| 0:09:46| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=586)|

| 0:10:01| One of the members who is not here this evening had been one who asked a question at first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| and we had gotten some information and wanted to be able to respond to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| I understand she is absent now but hopes to come later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| and the best I can do is get it to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| Well, Mr. King, I appreciate that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| We don't know what Ms. Singh's time of arrival will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| but I think that the Council can proceed with its business in her absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| There's a quorum and we'll continue unless there's some movement otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| You have four more minutes to talk about Item 9B if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=642)|
| 0:10:51| Okay, we'll move to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| You've got a full five minutes, Mr. Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| if you could just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| John Huber, PO Box 23038, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| We're just here on the second reading for about four and a half acres on Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| We've talked about it a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| We're asking for you guys to approve the recommendation that came to you from the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| a unanimous recommendation from Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| that has been forwarded to you for the approval of RN 5 on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| As mentioned in the first few meetings, we certainly feel it is an appropriate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| It's only about 400 feet out of an intersection, a commercial intersection in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| It's located very strategically across from a public park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| and there is just a massive need, massive, massive need for affordable housing in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| I was actually just before the meeting reading the State of Housing Report, the 2022 report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| that was put together by the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors, just came out a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| Something jumped out at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| It said that the new homes in Knoxville, the average new home being built in Knoxville, costs almost $360,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| I don't think that's affordable to most people, especially inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=727)|
| 0:12:17| We're trying to create – these are apartments, certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| but we are trying to create a good, safe environment of new construction housing to house people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| For example, if you've got a couple that's making minimum wage, they're making $7, $8 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| so combined they're probably making $30,000, $35,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| Per guidelines, they should only be spending about $700 to $750 a month in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| Gosh, and that's for a one-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Today, rents most places are – for a one-bedroom, $1,100, $1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| We're going to be able to roll these 120 units out with one-bedroom rents starting in that $700 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=777)|
| 0:13:06| Given the fact how expensive things are to build today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| and the quality and the aging of the affordable housing product in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| we really would appreciate your approval. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Council members, there's one other person signed up to speak in favor of Item 9B, Margaret Bickley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Ms. Bickley, if you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=807)|

| 0:14:09| A diversity of people across Knoxville and Knox County are motivated by faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| and informed by research to solve problems that hurt our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| The critical lack of affordable housing is one such problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Because of efforts that Justice Knox initiated and assisted with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| this body unanimously passed an ordinance last year to assure funding supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| to improve the available of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=873)|

| 0:14:56| but the need is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=896)|

| 0:15:34| This story, this unbelievable stress, is repeating throughout our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=934)|

| 0:15:52| to wit up-to-date, energy efficient, safe housing for singles, couples, and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| that will be affordable to those making 50% of the area median income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| and those who qualify for KCDC vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| We need these units, and we need many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| So in passing the affordable housing ordinance last year, this body endorsed the dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| The vision of housing for Knoxville families who earn well below this area's median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| To make that vision a reality, you must approve the housing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| The challenges that come with this growth can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| Needed sidewalks can be added and connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| Traffic patterns can be studied and improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| But in the meantime, our Knoxville neighbors, Knoxville children, Knoxville seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| need housing they can afford so they can live in security and dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| Don't just dream it. Do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1006)|

| 0:17:03| First is Lynn Siglin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Miss Siglin, if you could approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| I'm Lynn Siglin. We live on Broadview Drive, 518.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| The city needs responsible citizens, and that's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| And I looked up the definition of responsible, and it is to have an obligation to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1041)|
| 0:17:30| or having control over the care for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| And what we're concerned about is the care and the welfare of 120 apartment families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1057)|
| 0:17:51| Many would probably have children crossing Bruin Road, which is a very busy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1071)|
| 0:18:01| But if you add 120 units, that's going to be just a whole lot more of a risk for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1081)|
| 0:18:10| and families crossing over to go to the pool in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| Two weeks ago we had another accident on Bruin Road right down from the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| Today I walked down and got part of the telephone pole that was broken off laying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| They repaired, put a new pole in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| But it's just the risk involved to the children and families, plus the traffic of the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1110)|
| 0:18:41| If you vote to individually to vote and approve R and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| then you really need to require the city to be responsible for the care of the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| that will be living there by requiring sidewalks put in by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| and also a traffic light to make traffic stop to let people cross, or cars to pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| This is our big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| R and 1, like it is, or R and 2, it's another possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| But that's our concern. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1162)|

| 0:19:32| If you could start by saying your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1174)|

| 0:19:39| I live at 514 Broadview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| My property is adjacent to the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| I, too, know that affordable houses are needed everywhere across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| I took my grandson down to a shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| and behind the shopping center was a tent city on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| Homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| It was the saddest thing I ever saw, though that's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| There's going to be a lot more homeless people if we don't have affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| However, I also am a law-abiding citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| and I believe that rules and regulations that are set by the city should be followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| changed, or conditions changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| In 2013, the zoning was downsized on this property from R2 to R1A, LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| Mr. Quint Bourgeois, I hope that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| purchased the property as a retirement investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| His plan was to build apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| It was zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| It allowed him to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| However, he presented his building plans to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| The maps were changed to reflect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| The proposed road through the property showed up on the city maps as Bear Cub Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| The city came through in 2013 and rezoned the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| because the land use was higher than what it should be for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| He didn't have a chance to put apartments on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| In 2015, in 2016, he reapplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| He wanted to put apartments on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| He did appeal the decision also to city council and was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| According to the archived plan amendment reports, which I looked up and printed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| the planning commission states that the property was intentionally zoned R1A, LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| citing it conflicted with the city's plans for future development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| which was low-density residential and had been in place at least since 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| and states that LDR uses are appropriate for future development of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| The plan amendment reports state repeatedly there is no error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| The zoning was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| In 2019 recode Knoxville, the zone was not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| The 2022 one-year plan also lists the property land use as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| Not one of the requirements to warrant plan amendments to the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| and the north sector plan have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| The planning commission staff acknowledges this with their own remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| no changes, no changes, but suggests that there was an error in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| which I hope I've just refuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| All of the city's standards set forth in Article 16E, the Code of Ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| that are required to be met to allow rezoning have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1368)|
| 0:22:57| I'd like to read this, though it's not one of the required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| In addition to the standards below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| evaluation of proposed map amendments must consider the appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| of the zoning district to the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1389)|

| 0:23:16| and not for a specific development and or use of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| Going down through the amendments, if you look, it does not meet all of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| It does not meet all the city's standards required to amend the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| The subject property does not meet location criteria for MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| It is not near a community activity center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1427)|

| 0:24:20| The RN-5 zoning is too extreme for this acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| for the infrastructure and for the existing land use in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1464)|

| 0:25:52| Ponds Gap has three shopping centers within seven-tenths of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| There are five parks and three universities nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| It was built on over 14 acres, not four acres like the property we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| It has 102 units, not 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| It also offers many extra amenities to its residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| I would say there is no comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Let's find a way to do it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| So, to sum it up, for the past 10 to 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| the Planning Commission has been defending and protecting the Inskip neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| by not allowing any zoning change to this property on Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| Requests to change the zoning from RN1 to RN2 have been denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| because it is inappropriate and inconsistent with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| It doesn't meet the requirements for a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| There is no infrastructure to support a change in zoning, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| Well, the neighborhood is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| It hasn't changed over the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| There have been no improvements, no upgrade to infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| I would know. I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Yet here we are today with the Planning Commission approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| not just rezoning this property to an RN2, but all the way up to an RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| That just doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| The only thing that has changed, the city of Knoxville needs more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| That didn't happen overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| and it won't be fixed by granting Mr. Huber his rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| What will happen if Mr. Huber gets to build his development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| a lot of people will get crammed into a space too small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| and with no surrounding infrastructure to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Not only that, the increase in automobile and foot traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| will put their lives and the lives of everyone else in the neighborhood at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| In fact, the morning of June 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| there was a bad car wreck on that stretch of Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| that closed the road for the rest of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Does Knoxville need more housing? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Should this property be developed? Yes, but not at RN5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| That doesn't work or fit in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Mr. Huber says it doesn't work for him financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| as a smaller development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| I'm sorry, then let someone else develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| We don't care who lives on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| We don't care how much they pay to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| We're talking about human lives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| That's all we ask of you today as you weigh your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Please consider what is best for our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| and what is in the best interest of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| That's three speakers, but there is one more person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| signed up to speak in opposition if you wish to suspend your roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| I would like to move to hear one more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| Motion made. Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Any opposed? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| One more speaker on this is Ms. Anita Case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Ms. Case, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Hello. My name is Anita Case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| I live at 1107 Henrietta Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| I've lived there since the early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| I support affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| I understand the urgent need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| for more housing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| Inskipp is one of the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| densely populated communities in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| multiple apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| with multi-dwelling apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Bruin Road is narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| with a hill cresting above Broadview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| There are frequent accidents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| There are no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| I'm concerned for children and other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| who walk on Bruin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| and attempt to cross the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| North Ridge Crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| children have to walk on Bruin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| to get to the pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| and the park with no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| We've been pleading for the city for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| for sidewalks and more safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| We are just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| densely populated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| and I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| but that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| a good use of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| to be zoned as R5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| It's just too many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| people packed in that small space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I'm just concerned about the safety of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you. Council, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| People signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| I had a question for Mr. Harold Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| the engineer. Mr. Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| I believe you have had an opportunity to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| at the situation on Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| Several discussions, of course. Could you give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| your assessment generally of the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| for sidewalks and what the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| would be to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| building sidewalks on that stretch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| This is earlier than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| what we would typically do at this stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| but we did look at the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| What it would cost the city to construct the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| on the east side of Bruin, beginning at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| park and continuing on down the Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| You're looking at approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| $700,000, about $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| to construct that portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| the sidewalk. Then it's a question of whether there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| improvements at Dutch Valley or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| Sidewalk-wise, you're looking at $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| depending on if there's other improvements, you may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| pushing $1 million. One of the focus points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| that we would have on this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and that we would require and we have passed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| to a potential developer this requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| and it's what the folks have brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| and that is the crossing at Bruin itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| The driveway must be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| where there's proper sight distance. It makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| that the crossing would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| in that general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| I began this by saying some of this is premature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| from our typical process because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| typically you get the rezoning and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| we will require a traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| and in this particular one we are going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| that the pedestrian movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| particularly across Bruin Road into the park itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| will be addressed. Probably a longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| answer than you wanted. My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Just a follow up question and correct me if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| I get anything wrong here. Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| of course is a two lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| There's no shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| and there's ditches on each side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| and to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| to the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| or the bus stop you would either have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| to walk presently. You would either have to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| on the road or in a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Is that correct? Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| You've talked about the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| building the sidewalk that would connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| the development to transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| and what business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| node is available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| When would we expect to have a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| built there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| You are looking at a period of probably years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| As council is aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| these type of projects take years to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| a few years in and of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| Right now the funding is not in place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| As we've mentioned before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| there will be a comprehensive presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| to council of all the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| we have deemed as sidewalk needs in the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Knoxville which again approach $2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Based on the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| that council will help set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| that will establish the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| There's not even any real certainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| if priorities, depending on the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| that that sidewalk would ever be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| with certainty, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I will say that we're going to give you a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| that shows about $2 billion worth of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| and that will include this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| Where that falls truly will be the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| and council's decision. We'll make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| but that will be in your all's court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Your best scenario is years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| It takes a few years. By the time you go through design and right-of-way acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| and then I have the actual construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| that's what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| Just a point of information before we go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Mr. Cannon, the developer will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| if this is rezoned and he goes forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| what would the developer's obligation be for sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| on his property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Developers are obligated to do sidewalks along the frontage of Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| along the entire frontage of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| One of the options they have proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| and I'm cautious to put words in their mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| but we happen to agree with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| that putting the sidewalk on the west side of Bruin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| is a dead end for all practical purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| and it may be more feasible to partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| putting the sidewalk on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| and they have expressed an interest in that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I think this comes out of the additional studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| that will take place down the road if this passes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| I think anybody that's looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| would say that the park side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| of the road would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| far easier to put a sidewalk on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| than the side that the development is going to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| So people coming from the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| it would necessitate them coming across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| and then going to the proposed sidewalk that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Including the connectivity to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| and candidly I appreciate what the developer has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| thrown out as an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Typically they'll put a sidewalk in so they can check the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| This approach makes a lot more common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| The developer would only be required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| place the sidewalk along his frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| but not further down. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| I wanted to say one more thing while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| it was just addressed is there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| comparisons made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Hollywood Drive and Pond Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| in the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Actually I was on the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| when that project came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| That project was a lot different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| For one thing the project had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| an existing sidewalk from the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| when that project was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| When the housing was completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| people could automatically walk down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| to the Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| So they wouldn't have to wait for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| and the other points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| that make that much difference is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| that they would walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| to a bus stop safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| from that project and the bus service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| along Sutherland Avenue is quite good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Also there's a whole system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| of greenways already on Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| plus the business node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| along Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| This is extraordinarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| more enhanced let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| than what we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Now I analyzed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| when I was on the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| and it fit all the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| of a good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| to build affordable housing that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| livable for the people and the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| It's not just enough to build affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| We have to raise the bar to where we're just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| building small spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| If we're going to build affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| it should be to the extent that it is livable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| you have walkability to transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| you have a functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| business node close by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| this area here that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| does not have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| close to what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| area on Pine Gap did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| I was happy to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| off of Sutherland on Hollywood Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| and it fit all the criteria that I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| If this one did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I would be happy, happy, happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| to support it but looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| I cannot because it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| have all the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| that we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| The business node is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Let's put it that way. There's a bar, a convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| maybe a barber shop. There's a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| general but it's pretty far down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| and the bus stop is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| 450 feet away. It's at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| the length of four football fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| and you can't safely walk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| the developer's plan which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| lists these as amenities in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| an empty hole there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I mean you can say the bus stop is only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| 450 feet away but if you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| walk there safely then it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| not as well because you're not going to drive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| There's no transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| the touted transition between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| the development and the business node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| and the neighborhood. There's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| residential between the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| and the business node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| and you can't traverse it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| the way you could over on Southern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| that this is not comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| to the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| on Pine Gap. If it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| I would support it gladly just like I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Let's take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2552)|
| 0:42:50| And with that I've taken up a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| so I'll turn it over to my council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Chiefs if there's anything we need to know let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| Yeah thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| I think Council Member McKenzie you had your light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| next and then Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Several of my questions have been answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| in the conversation with Council Member Thomas but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| I think the key word here is safely and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| It sounds like we already have children and adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| who are walking Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| actually walking in the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| or in a ditch perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| So traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| will that happen if this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| does not happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| I hope I'm going to answer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| in keeping with the way you're asking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| If the development goes forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| to the next step they will have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| a traffic impact study period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| and it must include the pedestrian elements to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| That will be before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| engineering will consider any plans submittal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| related to the development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| Under that assumption that he would move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| if this rezoning passes yes that will be a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| What would be the timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| That will be one of the first things that we're going to ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| respectively that will be one of the first things they will want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| because there are sight distance issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| along Bruin Road and their entrance must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| placed at a location that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| safe sight distance is established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| That will also help establish the pedestrian crossing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| As it relates to if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| approved access into the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| would the city or would the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| be responsible for any type of safety measures be it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| a caution light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| lineage whatsoever? Who's responsible for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| In this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| we would say that the developer would be responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| Would that need to be established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| in the contracting or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| how do we ensure that if this is approved that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| does follow through with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| I think we give the consultant who will be preparing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| study itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| a lot of information will come from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| as far as the location of the crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| and what they're proposing as a safe configuration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| for that crossing. We'll make the ultimate call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| whether we agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| We want to give the consultant the chance to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| that we have anyone here from CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| but I also share the concern as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| walkability to the nearest bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| that is 450 feet and so I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| what CAT's procedure would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| even to consider an additional stop closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| Council Member Smith sits here but do we have someone from CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Mr. Director Thorne is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| If he could maybe address that I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| Isaac Thorne, Director of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| To answer your question, we're in phase two of CAT Reimagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| which we're redesigning our entire bus network so we would take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| into consideration if the council does approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| The next phase is where we're laying out the routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| for the entire bus network throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| We would take that into consideration that affordable housing is going to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| at this location. The closest bus stop right now is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Dutchtown Road off the 20, the central route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Council Member McKenzie, I just wanted to sort of clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| if this development is approved there will be a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| if it's not approved there will not be a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Also, I've had the opportunity to visit this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| including once with Council Member Thomas and I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| that right now walking on Bruin Road would not be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| It will be marginally safer after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| if this project is approved because there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| a sidewalk where there is none now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Also, I notice that there is a pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| that would not be on Bruin Road to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| the current bus stop through like going out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| a back entrance that's not on Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| I just thought I'd note my personal observations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| and also the thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| the developer is obliged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| to build, to construct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| sidewalk on the property that they own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| but the fact that they'd be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| build that sidewalk instead of on the west side on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| which has better connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| would be better. Our engineering staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| has agreed that that would be better and the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| is willing to do that I think that's better for residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| I would commit to making sure that either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| through the developer one way or another we'd have a safe crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| for all the people who get from the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| to the east side and back and forth especially to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| Council Member Parker then Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| then Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| A couple of things I wanted to point out about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| this project are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| particularly the public swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| you know I learned early on in my term that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Knoxville has few public swimming pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| none out west I did learn that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| but with that attraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| for area residents not just in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| but other parts of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| when we do our sidewalk study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and look at how to prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| sidewalk projects I would hope that this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| be one at the top of the list because of that public swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| and you know other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| where we have those amenities that will attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| individuals from all around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| and another thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| struck me about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| I agree with what I've heard and I was a little surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| we have a sidewalk project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| in our agenda on Atlantic that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| in 2018 and it's now moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| forward and so maybe it's a more unique case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| but that's an example of how even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| once approved it can take multiple years for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| the funding to be pulled together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| for that project to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| anything you want to say on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| Councilwoman you have a number of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| that have kind of been in that status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| and one of the commitments we've made over the past couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| is not to let these projects drag on anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| we're pushing them forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| properly pushing them forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| with public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| we're not looking at seven years or six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| if this became the priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| but you do have a design season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| you have a season frankly that I think you all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| advocate and that be meeting with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| and then you go into the right away phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| in the construction so that does take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| but it doesn't take as long as the one we're going to be talking about later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Wonderful, thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| So I just wanted to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| and I said this at our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| I'm committed to ensuring that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| community gets the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| investments it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| not just because of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| affordable housing project but because of the public swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| and because it is an area of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| with more density than others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| We have a project that's moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| on Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| and it has sidewalks proposed on both sides of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| and I've heard a lot of pushback from residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| about sidewalks on one side where it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| where it would impact the residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| and I think we should think about projects like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| where if there's pushback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| on there being two sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| we can shift that funding to projects like these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| where there's a real need, there's a lot of community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| showing up asking for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| and we can reevaluate that project down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| to see if we still want to move forward with two sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| but we might want to shift some projects around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| and put the funding where there is real need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| and with the public swimming pool and the absolute need for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| I think this is an important project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| of increased investment in infrastructure in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| Thank you. Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Yeah, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| I have a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| for a couple of different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| I want to touch on the pond gap thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| I respect that you say there's existing sidewalk there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| but I also continually keep hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| there will be sidewalk that has to happen here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| if this happens, so I see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| It's a two lane road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| with a pond gap has a retaining wall on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I believe one of the questions that was risen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| was the acreage of pond gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| KGIS shows that as five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| I'd like to call on Ms. Wade and ask her a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Ms. Becky Wade, about the project there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| So the pond gap development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| was five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| This project here, Mr. Huber, is four and a half acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Is that correct? So it's a half acre difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Ms. Wade, of the five acres, I don't expect you to be able to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| how much of it was usable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| What were the obstacles of land that weren't usable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| in that five acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Certainly the land at the pond gap area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| was not flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| There's a hillside that had to be taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| and not developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| So part of the acreage is in hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| And then there's also the pond at pond gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| that was restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| and built around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| So the units there are less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| than what's proposed by Mr. Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| but it's probably denser than what he's proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| Because of the limitations to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| That whole left side, when you're standing and looking from the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| that entire left side was a collaboration with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| to restore the pond there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| which is also required, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Or no? It just was existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| It doesn't disturb, maybe Mr. Cannon can answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Would there be required detention, retention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| But that might also go under parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Yes ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| I appreciate that Ms. Wade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| So size wise they're very comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Mr. Huber, what are your plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| or what are the required plans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| I'm sorry my screen's gone away here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Sharp Lane, I know we touched on this last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| Currently there are no plans to link to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| but that's ultimately a call for the civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| who designs the property in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| City of Knoxville Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| to see if it's a reasonable access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| I do agree with Mayor Kin Cannon's discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| I think that would be a great walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| It's a much smaller road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| trying to get over to the closest bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| That might be a much safer way to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| I think there's a lot of opportunity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| with that other road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| because your property fronting Bruin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| not a traffic engineer as I always say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| but you have the opportunity to make traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| only make a right turn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| or only be able to turn left so you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| crossing traffic on Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| So just what I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| from looking at the aerial view there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Yeah and that would all get worked out with a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| and the civil engineer in the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Okay, thank you. That's my last question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| and I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Is there anyone here from Parks and Rec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| Oh, there is. So surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| I don't know if you'll be able to answer this question or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| A comment that's on the other side of the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Do kids and families from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Is that Northgate? Northridge Crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| Do they come over to the pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Miss Ely? Would you be able to comment on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Miss Ely? I'm not familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| Director of Parks and Recreation Cheryl Ely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| I can't tell you specifically if they do or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| We know we get lots of kids where they're coming in and out from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| But they're all sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Do we think most of the kids that arrive come by cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| It could be a mixture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| When I'm there, and I can only tell you what I know when I'm there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| I see people in cars that are there most of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| But it's a very active pool and has a lot of people using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| Oh yes, we have about, I mean I guess we can see upwards of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| 500 people throughout a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and that's throughout a day, so not at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Thanks for letting me call you on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| Because there is sidewalk that goes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| That area across, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Yes, there is sidewalk that goes all the way across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| To Dutch Valley on that side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| And then the lack is the Bruin part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| So, alright, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you Miss Ryder. Council Member Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| And then we'll go to Vice Mayor and then back to Mr. Tom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Thank you Mayor, I think there's general consensus in the room around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| Supporting affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| So I think that's a really good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| I want to make sure I understand the process right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| On the infrastructure side, just to make sure I'm clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| The developer would have to build a sidewalk associated with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| And the traffic study is likely to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| Safe passage across the street from Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| To the pool, whether it's sidewalks on the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| Or west side of Bruin Road, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| That's correct. Okay, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| That's it for now, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Thank you Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I'm really glad to be hearing today about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Something different than we heard about in the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Which is infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| And I've been very interested in the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| That surrounds the Pond Gap development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| Pond Gap was the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| That the Affordable Rental and Workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| Housing Fund was used in the 2nd District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| That didn't start until 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| At that time, Council was recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| That there was a need for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| And this is still a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| That's critical today, but in that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| We had a significant discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| About infrastructure, and so I'm very glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| That we're talking about infrastructure today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| In that development, which we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| It was about the same acreage as being talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| In this development today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| There was significant infrastructure investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| In addressing chronic flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| That was going on, on Hollywood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| There was significant investment in road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Including the raising of Hollywood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Because one, it addressed the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| But it also addressed the sight distance issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| And so I'm particularly encouraged today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| To hear about a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| For a crosswalk, because I think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| We've heard from the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| And I'm also encouraged by hearing about the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Because if I remember correctly from the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| That we had in that previous discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| It was approved back in 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| The traffic study was what initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| A lot of those positive changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| With regard to the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| And with regard to addressing flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| And so that apparatus is a good vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| For dealing with the challenges that we're hearing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| From the neighbors today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Director Cannon, I was going to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| When we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| Potential for road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| I heard from the neighbors discussing sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| That would certainly be something that would be taken up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| In the traffic study, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| Absolutely, yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| We do have a fantastic amenity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| With regard to the public pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| If there was a necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| To have turn lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Would that be something that would also be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Yes sir, that would be a part of the consultant's evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| And I heard one of the neighbors talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| A hill and some sight distance issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Clearly that would be something that would be looked at as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| Yes sir, I'm at the risk of editorializing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| We the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Will get a lot of benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| From this traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| In that it will address sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Which in turn, there may be recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| To revisit speed limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| The fact that there would be the pedestrian crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| In my eyes, that's going to have to be done right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Which should slow traffic down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| When it's done properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| I don't think I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| That coming out of that study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| There will be good things for the overall neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| To address some of the questions I had tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Including hopefully the accident situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| That were mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| And the last part I'll talk about is sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| And we have desperately needed more funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| For sidewalks for a very long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| And unfortunately we continue to see that line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| Not getting the attention that everyone wants to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| That needs to be a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| And I'm hearing that from the council today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| That we need to make sure that we're funding sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| And so I'm excited to have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Hopefully about the sidewalk study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| And talking about greenways and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| For pedestrians and for bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Hopefully coming up soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| I really appreciate you looking ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Director Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| And thinking about the cost of a potential sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| And you mentioned a figure of $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I'm further encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| That I heard from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| That there's an interest potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| In a partnership with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| To figure out how to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| That critical infrastructure in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And I would pose to you that surely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| We can figure out a way to fund something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| If we're partnering with this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| To provide that infrastructure as a part of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| I know we're not going to solve that tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| But I just wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| That I think that's a critical piece of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| And I would encourage everyone to go back to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Put pen to paper and figure out a way to make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| As a part of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| But based on what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| I think the concerns are being addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Regarding infrastructure this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| So I plan on supporting it. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Thank you. Council Member Thomas and Council Member Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Question for Mr. Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| We had a cordial conversation this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| Didn't we? Yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| Even though I've made my opposition clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| But one thing we agreed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Is that this site is a good place for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| It's the scale, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| That we disagreed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| And another thing we agreed on was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Regardless of this vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| There's going to be a continuing discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Probably between you and I and the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| And if it's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| We will do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| The city should get in league| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| To make this as good a project as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| If it's not approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| I would welcome you to submit a different plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| And I would champion a particular plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| That I thought was supportive of the residents there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| That didn't overwhelm the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| So you and I will continue a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Regardless of how this goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| And so I just wanted to kind of put a little context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| To that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Is that this will continue either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| But my preference is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| And my whole concern about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Is that the scale of this is too big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| For the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| And it's going to be a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| Before the infrastructure catches up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| With the scale of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| And now just a couple more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| Specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| We talked some about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| The footprint of the housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| And the proportion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| That that footprint would take up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| Were you able to get that information for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| He was not able to return my call before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| So I apologize for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| I think generally you said that it was within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| City guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| But it was pretty close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| It did remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| Less than the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| So there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| Was 50% kind of a ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| Don't hold me to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| But yes I believe somehow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| 50% is stuck in my head of impervious area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| So impervious as you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| So 50% of that area would be impervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| And require a detention or retention pond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| And then we talked about the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| And there's some existing trees there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Well I don't want to put words in your mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| What is your plan for preserving the trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Or what would the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| As you're now submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| What would that necessitate as far as the canopy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Well all of that really is going to ultimately come down to the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| Again that's done by the civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| And agreed upon by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| The City of Knoxville Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| There is a nice stand of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| Broadview is the main road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| That the houses back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Front on Broadview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| They back up to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I think I mentioned to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| That I've driven by there several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| In the last couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| To try to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| And walk the property again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| To try to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| If there was a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| That we could try to save some of those trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| To try to keep a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| I do feel like there's going to be a retaining wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| On that upper portion of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| To be able to get it leveled out enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| To be able to build the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| Thank you Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| Council Member Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| I'm not sure who can answer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| So everybody be on the ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| My understanding is that this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| You'll be applying to THDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| For low income housing tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| That is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| And that zoning must be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Prior to submitting an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| If you were denied low income housing tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| You have an option on the property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| That is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| You may or may not go through with that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| It would be unlikely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| That's my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| But if this is rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Any project that were to be built on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Would have to go through the exact same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| Requirements Mr. Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| About infrastructure and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| Regardless of a future project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| That is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| A question for Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| This was mentioned by one of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| And I think we can confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| That this went before City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| In 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| On an application to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| From RM1 to RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| It went before City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| Twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Once in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| And then once again in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| And that was under the old zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| So I believe it was R1A to R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| For both requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| And those were denied by the City Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| Yes, under the old zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| And then when RECODE came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| This was still classified as a single family area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| Yes, there was a commitment made during that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| That as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| The residential neighborhoods would just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| The equivalent zone assigned to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| I'm troubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| With the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| You can speak into the microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| I'm troubled with the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| And the reasons given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| That these criteria met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| In regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| All three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| Agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| I guess I can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| The sector plan as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| And as one of the speakers said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| One of the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Is changes of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| Warranting amendment of the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| The statement is there were no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| To the road or utility network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| The second one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| Whether there was introduction of significant new roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| Or utilities that were not anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| During the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| And there haven't been any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| And then the third one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| An obvious or significant error or omission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| In the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| And the reason given as a significant error or omission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| The planning staff or council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Could have considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| Adjacent to a commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| But how do we know that they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| And just rejected it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| It sounds very weak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| And I say this very respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Because I've had a long relationship with planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| And I agree with you most of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| But I'm very, very troubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| At the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| To meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| And the reasons given to meet the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| For the change in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| It talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| It's only 500 feet from the bus route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| So there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| Bus route that's been added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| But the practical matter is you can't get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Speakers from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| Their observations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| Of these criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Well-founded to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Is a real stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| And I know we need housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| But we also have rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| And I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I feel very, very uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| With changing the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| With the criteria that are given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| And what really bothers me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| With the past history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Of the decisions that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| Two rejections of even RN2 before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| And we're dropping up from RN1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| To RN5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| It really bothers me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Because this kind of action by government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Neighborhoods and neighbors have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| And it causes a lot of cynicism in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| And I just don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| It's a prudent thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| To make this a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| And the fact is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| It's my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| It looks like a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| But we are not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| A safe space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| Of putting too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| Before we have the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| This I think is an example of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| It's going to be years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Before we get that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| And to continue to put the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Before the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| It's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| We're creating other problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| We're not addressing the housing problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| To some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| But we're creating other problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| And I was hoping we were getting away from this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Of putting density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| In areas that the infrastructure wouldn't support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| I've supported many, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| Both when I was on the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| And both when I was on this Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| And I will continue to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| But I always look at the balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Of putting them where the infrastructure is all there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| And one of my biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Probably my biggest concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Is for the residents themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| To look at housing and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| We need to provide housing that is good enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| For people to live well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| And have some kind of relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| With the neighborhood that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| To have real safe access to transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| To have access to businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| That are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Quantity I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| That they can possibly shop there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Or get fine points there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| And this really bothers me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Because I think we're making the same mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| That I was hoping we would get away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| And that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Putting too large a scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| Into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| That the infrastructure wouldn't support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| And I don't think that's for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| And I think it's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| We're responsible to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| Because how long is it going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| With the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| After we've already put 120 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| With all the people in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| How long is it going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| For them to have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| For at least the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| That it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| And the situation that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| On town, that was done very, very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| We addressed every one of those needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| And my support has gone away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| I wish I could support this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| But this one does not do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| And that's why I cannot support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| Putting this many units without the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| To support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| I think it's causing a lot of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| We're creating a lot of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| And the timing of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| I mean, how long is it going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Again, I guess just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| It really bothers me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| The confidence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| Members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| Have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4706)|
| 1:18:36| Information decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| Are suddenly, everything shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| Everything goes up all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| I-1, I-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| So that's what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| I hate to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| On opposite opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| But I want to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Why I'm going to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| This property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| As I said last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| Has medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| And a large public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| It has two potential roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| And there will be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| If not more than some sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| To support this and a crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| The administration and the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Have committed to supporting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| And I want to clarify something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| That was said just a moment ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| About what was zoned and wasn't upzoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| During recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| Council has half changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| Or more than, I think, since recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| A few of us were here in different capacities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| I respect that Councilman Thomas was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| For part of the process in a different capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| There was very intentional conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| During the recode meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Many of which you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Nothing within the residential areas was upzoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Without a public discourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| So it wasn't that they were maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| At a different density because they shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| Or they couldn't ever be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| It was because it required the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| Or anybody who bought a parcel to go pay the fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| Go in and give people their chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| To have this public discourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| So I want to be very clear about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| There was different stance on zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| In the commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| Along the borders of corridors like Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| And Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| It was a very, very specific conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| I want everybody in the room to be clear about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| It required this conversation, it required us to duke it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Required him to pay fees, that's why it was held and maintained that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| It wasn't to verify or endorse anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| And the only other thing I'll say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| I hear you saying that things have changed, things have changed on a dime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| I think COVID and the demand and people coming to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| Has changed substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| And I will say on a personal note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| I said last time that the estimates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| That we need 17,000 more units of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| For the Knox County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| We just got a hundred and some apartments over here, isn't that enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Sadly it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| I have a tenant who is newly paralyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| The only bathroom is on the second floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| She has nowhere to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| She's paralyzed, I built her a ramp she can get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| And we're working on trying to find her a way to get up the stairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| There's nowhere for her to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Because there are no apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| The wait lists are hundreds of people deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| And not only will she need just any old apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| It has to be in her price range, she's a single female| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| And it also has to be ADA compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| So I'm working with her, that's a personal side note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| But it also rings to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| How big the need is out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| And that doesn't mean we have to approve everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| But when I look at the bird's eye view of this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| I see differences to this particular parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| As to how it lays out in the roads and the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| Is it imperfect? Is it perfectly ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| No, and there will be changes to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| So I'm going to go ahead and support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| Thank you, Councilmember Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| Thank you, Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| I really thought Councilmember Ryder was going to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| So I'm going to call the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| I just want to say something really quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| And that was helpful, what you shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Councilmember Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Because one thing I did want to bring up is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| The recode process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| And we may need to make a commitment as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| I'm sure no one on this Council who went through it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Wants to go through it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| But some sort of version of it that looks at our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| And analyzes whether we are making space for multifamily housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| And whether there might need to be some zoning changes to create more space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| I feel like coming out of recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| There was a message sent out that we were moving away from a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| When we would have these little spot changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| And zoning code around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| And instead we were doing this overhaul of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| So I can understand if there's some frustration from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| But I do feel like following recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| We should have our vision for zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| In the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| But I do think we have some more work to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| To open up and expand where multifamily can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| In the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| And I do think that we have a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| That might be more willing to do that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Than four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| Thank you. Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Brief reply to my colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| Who mentioned the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| That was in the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| That you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| She needed things that was ADA compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| And if she moves into this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| She may need to walk to a bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| And she's not going to be able to walk to a bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| For years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| And this is what I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| It's great to talk about all these units we're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| But we need to be building units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| That are a cut above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| That it's more than just putting a roof over people's heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| And this is an extreme example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| But we made really big mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| In this country back in the 60's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| We were building public housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| We were housing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| And without as much thought as it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| About what kind of conditions they were actually living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| And now those buildings actually even had to be torn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| Now I'm not trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| That this particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| Is in that arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| But the principle is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| Is I want affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| But I want it to be to the degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| That people who live there have amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| And can walk to a bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| And can shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| And can get close to a true business node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| Where they may be able to get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| And may be able to shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| So I'm actually wanting to go a step further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| I'm not trying to keep affordable housing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| I'm wanting to go a step further with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| And we need to work harder I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Than the proposal here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| There's lots of blighted property around Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| That if we worked harder and got more creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| We could turn that into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| A lot of it is on the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Where there's all these amenities I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| But we just do it where it's easy to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| Regardless of the context of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| Regardless if the people who are going to live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| Are going to be able to be part of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| So I actually want to take it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| And I don't see this doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| I think what we're doing is doing the same mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| Of building density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| And the infrastructure does not support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| And we're creating problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Seeing no further questions, all those in favor please say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5235)|

| 1:28:01| Patricia Dodd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| I would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| That amendments to the one year plan are not warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| None of the criteria is met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| I would like to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| It's been shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| By the other planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Attempts by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| That no error was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| Which is what the planning commission has based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| Their judgment on at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| There were no errors made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| That that property was zoned intentional for an intentional reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| There is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| Amendment to the map is not warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Mr. Dodd, did you want to speak to council on this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5339)|
| 1:29:11| Quite simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| I want to thank Councilman Thomas for his support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| I think what he has said is 100% correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| Putting the cart before the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Just creates more problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| Yes, Knoxville needs housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| But you don't want to put these people in housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| And say, yay, we gave them a roof over their head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| And then make every other single aspect of their life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| Harder on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| And that's what living in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| Crammed into that space will do to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| It really isn't 450 or 500 feet to that bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| From that proposed opening to that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Down the road, I drove it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| Checked it with my odometer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| It's 3 tenths of a mile, that's 1500 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| And none of it is safe walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| The bus stops are out in the open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| They're not none of those new ones, nice ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| That are built shelters with benches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| People waiting at those bus stops are going to be in the hot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| And they're going to have to risk their life to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| Again, thank you, Councilman Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| Thank you, Ms. Case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5423)|
| 1:30:35| That concludes the people who have signed up to speak on this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Any questions or discussion from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5444)|

| 1:31:10| Mr. Huber, do you wish to speak? Mr. King, do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| Ms. Siglin, Ms. Dodd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Mr. Dodd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| Ms. Case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Mr. Councilmember Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| Thank you, Mayor. I'm going to vote no on this because I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| There's a lot being said tonight. I think infrastructure is the biggest barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| To affordable housing in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| And I agree with a lot of sentiments from my colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| Mr. Councilmember Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| I think that's an appropriate process for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Particularly as it relates to affordable housing and guaranteeing the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| I trust your intentions to apply for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| I hope you get the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| But rezoning this doesn't guarantee affordable housing in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| And then the second part of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| I think the jump from R and 1 to R and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| I think if you do development here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| I think you obviously need to increase to medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| But I think that's without a guarantee of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| Should you fail to receive the funding for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| You can do market rate housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| I just don't think that a jump from R and 1 to R and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Is a good idea without that guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| So that's why I'll be voting no on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| I just want to say that I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| Responsible of this body to approve that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Much density with a lack of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| And the amount of time it's going to put that infrastructure in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| It will be even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| Irresponsible for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Not to do everything it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| To put the infrastructure in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| To spend whatever money is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| To make this place livable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| For the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| If this project comes to fruition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=5585)|

| 1:40:28| Last year we did serve 6 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| And also a total of 18 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| Including children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| And we managed to provide services to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| As far as, I call them laptops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| With their tablets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| For school children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| You know, children who are in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| To help them with their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| Also to pay off a fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Because a mother, she was working and was about to lose her driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| And so we had to step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| And prevent that from happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| So she would not lose employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| We also have a family whose son is autistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| And we managed to buy her a tablet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| To help him with school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| To help communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| Because with autism he was not able to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| But now he's enrolled in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| He's no longer exhibiting extreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| Outbursts from the autism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| And he's able to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| So those are the things that we are trying to help families with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| Thank you, I think that the program is rather unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| And that it's multi-generational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| And that it's kind of wraparound supportive services for the entire family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| Intentionally the entire family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| And I just think it's really unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| And we're hoping to increase the family as we go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| May I add this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| That it is a pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| It is new to the Salvation Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| And we have over 2,000 physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| Who are implementing the Pathway of Hope program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| They have served over 4,000 children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| And over 2,000 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| And have successfully impacted their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| Councilmember Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| I actually had a few questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| But also Director Wade, you might be able to answer these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| So maybe both come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| And I'll ask the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| So I reached out to Director Wade just to get an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| Before our meeting on this pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| And understand that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| Hope of serving more families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| But that was reduced to six families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Could you talk a little bit more about why that reduction happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Well, we got a late start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| Because the training is so intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| So we got a late start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| And then unfortunately the staff person who was doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| Became very ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| And we had to do the best we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| So we still serve six families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Just wondering about what the obstacles are you're facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6208)|

| 1:45:56| Yeah, I just thought I'd take the opportunity to ask Mr. Thorne a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| I'm curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| How many we already have on the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| I know we placed orders. Some of them still may be on order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| How many we have on the roads and how they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| Sure. Isaac Thorne, director of Knoxville Area Transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| We have 12 on the road right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| With this funding, we have 10 available buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| That we can purchase. 10 additional to the 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| Correct. So that would make a total of 22 buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| We're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| The possibility of having 50% of our fleet being electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| By 2027. What's the total number of the fleet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| 70. 70?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| So we're a ways off from getting a total electric, but that's the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Correct. And they're all doing great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| The ones that we have? Like they're able to run their routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Without needing to be recharged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| Yes. We charge our buses right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| Overnight at Magnolia, our operations facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| As standby charging, it takes about four hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| The next step for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| In order to expand our electric bus fleet is put in overhead charging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| That's for on route. So we want to put overhead charging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| At Knoxville Station at least 10 different bays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| To allow us to run those buses all day long throughout the routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| Right now, especially in this warmer weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| Hotter temperatures, AC running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6438)|

| 1:47:27| We're not running the AC at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| We're able to get 12 to 14 hours on those buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| So the overhead charging capability is really going to change the dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| Of how we operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| So right now you just switch them out more frequently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| So the overhead charging will be like a 30 minute charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| It's actually 4 to 5 minutes, maybe 8 minutes tops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| As they're in that station? Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6469)|

| 1:49:22| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| Ms. Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Yeah, just a quick question since we're on the topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| I know one of our, during the budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| process, we were talking about some difficulties with hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| lifeguards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Have we made any gains in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| We actually are full right now. We have lifeguards at both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| of our pools and are able to do door also so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| fingers crossed, we keep them throughout the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| But we really were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| open up and get people trained with the help of the Red Cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| because that's who helps us keep our lifeguards trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| So having this program actually provides additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| for those lifeguards and swim instructors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| to allow us to continue to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| So we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| The other thing is we have to get kids to learn how to swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| I know you didn't ask that, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| are realizing that there are lots of people, not even kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| but adults, that can't swim, and we have a lot of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| And so we have to figure out a way of getting people safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| and keeping them safe, and that is the role that we're playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6621)|

| 1:53:24| It's been that way, hadn't been looked at for over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6809)|

| 1:53:31| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6811)|

| 1:53:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| 12D is an ordinance to amend the charter of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6817)|

| 1:53:59| Thereto by Amending Article 7, Section 707B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| so as to change the language from the two candidates receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6844)|

| 1:54:28| of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6868)|

| 1:54:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| Motion seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| So this is going to be for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| I want to have a discussion around what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| are the implications of this change, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6892)|
| 1:55:00| You want to ask Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| I'm not sure which one wants to take that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| Mr. Frost, why don't you give a first answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| and then if Mr. Swanson has anything to add, he can add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Well, these comments apply to both this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| and the next ordinance on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| If a tie happened in a primary race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| instead of two people going onto the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| for the general election, three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| would be going on the ballot to the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| And then whoever received the most votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| in the general election would be declared a winner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| unless, of course, there was a tie in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| When we've had charter amendments in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| typically would we have any type of workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| to have further discussion around this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Is there a cost associated to the city or election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| around this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6963)|
| 1:56:03| If so, what would that look like in terms of dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| There is a cost associated with putting something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| I mean, it's just passed through by the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| to the city, because they have ballots to print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| They have newspaper advertisements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| to run as to the exact cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| I don't know if the administration spoke with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Somewhere in the recesses of my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| I can't remember where it was or what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| but I seem to recall that it cost $10,000 to the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7000)|
| 1:56:47| commission, which passed on to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| to put something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| That was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Mr. Frost, I believe that number has gone up significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| Mr. Swanson, could you share what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| we learned, I think, more recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| about the cost of charter amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| It will vary from item to item, depending on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| much has to be published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| And there's also costs associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| with printing the ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| And multi-page ballots certainly cost more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| for the printing purposes for the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| I'm getting all this from the election commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| so it's not stuff that I really know myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| But also, it costs more because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| have to have a lot of their people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| when they have multiple-page ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| It takes a lot more time for their people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| in the various polling places to put it together and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| And so the best information we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| is that for each ballot question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| it's going to run somewhere in the $25,000 to $35,000 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| just depending on the very specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| of that particular question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| And I don't think we have anyone here from the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| commission, maybe not someone sitting around the podium that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| has been around in local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| maybe other than the law directors, for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| But I know that we've had a tie on a ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| on an election ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| I think it was in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| No, was it before 2017?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| In 2017, I'm curious, historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| how many times have we seen those types of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| And I don't think that they happen very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| but do we even have that data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| I remember following that outcome pretty closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| and there was no, as I recall, nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| could recall another instance of a tie, but I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| done that research myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| I apologize, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| I neglected to notice that there is someone signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| So council member, I mean, we can come back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| and then OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| Mr. Bentley Marlowe, sorry, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| didn't see that you'd signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| You have up to five minutes to speak to item 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| Actually, I think Gwen was going down the line of thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| I'm concerned about what the cost would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| and how pressing this issue is, because I can't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| a time other than 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| I personally feel that things like charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| ought to begin with a workshop where we can sit down and know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| like Mr. Swanson just said, it depends on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| exactly has to be published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| So approving something with an unknown fiscal price tag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| just seems irresponsible to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| We're running a government, not a football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| So we don't need to hurry up offense style right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| I think that we could easily work in a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| where we could further flesh this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| explore the requirements, explore the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| get public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| And I think we might miss this July deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| but why could we not have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| get it before next July so that it's on the next city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| election cycle, and maybe even have a trigger law in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| so that if it passes and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| a tie in that exact election, that it would go into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| immediately right then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| Just a thought so we'd have all of our ducks in a row| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| and have an idea what the implications and cost would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Just as a matter of information, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| can only have charter changes when we have general elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| and that's every other year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| So it would have to be an even-numbered year to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| So if you did not do it this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| the next available time would be in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| Thank you, Mr. Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| I had a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| When pulling these charter amendments together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| I looked back at past charter amendments that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| been brought before council, and each one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| had fiscal information that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| the expenses of putting the issue on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| are expected to be minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| I'm curious what has changed this year versus just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| I think the last one was 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| I guess it might depend on what your concept of minimal expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| Certainly, I don't think it's ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| been less than $10,000 a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| and that was some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| But I'm only basing my estimate of the expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| based on what we have learned from the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| through telephone conversations with Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| and his folks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| I'd love an opportunity to give an overview of this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| item, if that would be OK with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| I introduced this set of charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7336)|
| 2:02:24| in lieu of a charter review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| knowing that we did not have sufficient time this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| to engage in a charter review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| and our next opportunity to submit charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| to the ballot, as Mr. Swanson noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| would not be for another couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| So while these changes could impact next year's election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| if we move the discussion to a later year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| then we're talking about the 2024 election ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| and impacting the 2025 city council elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| For me, this was important to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| Obviously, because of my personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| there was a tie previous to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| In 2017, I cannot remember the candidate's name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| but I learned of it through the process of experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7409)|
| 2:03:36| this tie, but it is very, very rare that it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| The proposal I have is similar to initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7423)|
| 2:03:50| that other cities have tried in looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| at how to revise their electoral process to either prevent ties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7433)|
| 2:04:00| or to simply ensure that the ability to select| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7440)|
| 2:04:07| their representatives remains with the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| And in some cities, in some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| this is a commitment to holding runoff elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| which is quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| For me, this was a, and by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| city council, in the case of a tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| has the option to either break the tie themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| or to hold a runoff election, which would be an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7474)|
| 2:04:42| This option eliminates the need to make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7482)|
| 2:04:48| and devises a process where that power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| to determine their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| remains with the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| And if there wasn't a tie to occur in the general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| then council has the option of a runoff election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| if council wants to remain committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| to keeping that power in the hands of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| For me, even though this is not a frequent, something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7515)|
| 2:05:23| happens frequently, I believe that when an issue presents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| itself, it is an opportunity for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| to learn from that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| And if we can find a resolution that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| could be easily implemented, I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| don't see any reason for us not to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| When I, let's see, what else should I share about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7550)|
| 2:05:58| You know, through my experience, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| are a lot of questions and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| that rose from the community about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7564)|
| 2:06:10| And I really think that it should be a process that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| try to avoid in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| It has the potential to cast a shadow over our elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| when there's no need, because we have this other option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| to send candidates forward who receive the two highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7587)|
| 2:06:35| number of votes and let the voters decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| during the regular election in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| I really hope that you all will support this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| because I feel like it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| I've obviously put a lot of work into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| over the last several years, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| in the last couple of months, and researching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| what is possible and having discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| with the election commission and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| about how that situation could be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| About how that situation could have been prevented in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| And I believe this is a good solution for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| I would hate to see us not consider charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7638)|
| 2:07:26| because of a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| If there is concern and a need to be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| with more information, I would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| that we postpone this item tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| and continue discussion in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| rather than vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| Because I do believe it's a good proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| So I'm really asking for your support on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| Council Member Fugate, and then Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| The way I read this, it would be the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| with the two highest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| So it could be three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| It could be four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| It would just be however many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| had the second highest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| You could have a three-way tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| And then there would be four people on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Is that my understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| That's the way I read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| It certainly does create those extremely rare and awkward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| situations when there is a tie, and complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| I think we need to have pretty robust conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| and involve the Election Commission to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| what the various options there are before we put something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| on the ballot for a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| It's kind of my issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| And Ordinance D and Ordinance E. So D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| is for council district seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| And I believe E is for at-large seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| But there's nothing proposed to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| for instance, a tie in a mayoral election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| So that seems to be not considered and proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7756)|
| 2:09:16| And I think if we're going to make changes and put changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| like that on the ballot, they need to all happen at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| I will say the other thing in conversations about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| is that our system here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| centers around majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| When you have two people going on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| for the final runoff, you have typically over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| So you have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| And even in the mayor's race in our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| the mayor's race, if a candidate gets over 50% in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| there is no final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| So there's all these aspects to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| that I feel there needs to be more of a committee-type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| really big conversation with the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| to look at what the other possibilities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| what other communities have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| if and when there has been a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| And I will just point out the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| that ours runs, where we elect people based on a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| you get people that get over 50% majority support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| of the community to get on to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| Nationally, we all know we had somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| who got elected with not a majority of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| In fact, more than once, but most recently, somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| who did not get a majority took over leadership of our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| and has turned it upside down and repealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| and was able to finagle and repeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| a 50-year law of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| So I think there's some considerations going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| into what's the right solution to the problem before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| We just need a lot more vetting of different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| before we decide on what the option is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| that goes on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| So that's my issue with supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7863)|
| 2:11:03| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| I'm going to dust off my old Knox County Election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| Commissioner hat and try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| some of the initial questions that were talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| So with what my understanding is and keeping in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| I haven't been on the Election Commission in more than four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| years, you'd need to add machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| You'd have to have training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| You'd have increased precinct complexity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| because you're dealing with city voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7890)|
| 2:11:31| and you're going to make sure these questions, these charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7891)|
| 2:11:38| questions are going to be provided for the city voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| and not for people who live in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| And you're going to have to make accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| to deal with the city voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| So I think the estimate of 25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| sounds pretty reasonable to me per question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| I would agree with Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| I think this type of discussion about a charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| needs a very long time to be vetted and discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7923)|
| 2:12:06| with all the parties that need to be engaged in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| And we just simply don't have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| to do that process at the time this is being brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7939)|
| 2:12:30| Sorry, my thought just went out of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| I think there could, you know, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7951)|
| 2:12:55| hopeful that we can continue the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| But based on the conversations, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| not sure how much time council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| need to gather all the information they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| When I looked back at past charter amendment processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7991)|
| 2:13:17| I did not see charter review committees formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| I did not see multiple workshops held on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| And for a more thorough discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| of amendments that could be made to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| I agree that we should have a very thorough process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| But for the amendments that I had proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| I felt like they were straightforward and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| enough that this is something that we could pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| In terms of elections, there are other revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| to our election system and other revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| to our budgeting system that I would like to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| But I think, you know, similar to the recode process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| and similar to, you know, looking at the county's charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| review process recently, even if we develop that charter review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| process, we're not going to be able to go through every issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| and be able to develop every charter amendment that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| want to present and put it together as one package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| and move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| Even in those situations, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| to have to take small bits of it and review it and decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| if we want to move forward with those charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| And so I'm going to make an amended motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| to postpone this item for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| and see if we can get a little more clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| and answer some of the lingering questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| that council has and be able to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| with this on three readings in lieu of a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8105)|
| 2:15:10| with two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| That's my hope is that we can, you know, find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| So you're making a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8119)|
| 2:15:19| For two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| OK, the motion on the floor is to postpone this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Any discussion on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| On the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| Seeing none, all those in favor of postponing for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8135)|
| 2:15:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| Back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| Oh, you don't have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| We need to do a roll call on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8149)|

| 2:16:17| Two in favor, six opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| OK, the motion to postpone fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| Council Member Ryder, and then I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| come back to you, Ms. Parker, if you still have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| This may be for Mr. Swanson, or there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| may be other folks in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| Were the most recent charter changes that I can recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| were pension-related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| And those were pretty enduring, multi-year changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| or discussions for those to end up on the ballot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| What was the processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| That was early in the Rojero administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| when we changed the pension plan all around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| and created the hybrid pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| And so we went through a huge process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| to do that that involved many, many public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| before we ended up with a final product of the Plan H pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| plan that we ultimately ended up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| So that was a very extensive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| And those are the most recent that you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| Mr. Johnson, you recall anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| The most recent one that I can recall, several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| it was related to the election commission requested this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| It was to bring the primary election date forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| It was to give time for military ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| OK, because that process and the cost and the ballots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| that were being missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| It was an issue of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| They were not having enough time to get the ballots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| out from military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| You know, I would just say I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| like this is a similar process to changing the primary date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8278)|
| 2:18:10| This is an issue of, well, more so on the budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8290)|
| 2:18:16| That is purely to give us more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| But on this item, I view this as city council as required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8302)|
| 2:18:34| by state law is determining how to manage and deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8314)|
| 2:18:39| with a tie situation in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| And I understand wanting to have election commission in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8323)|
| 2:18:52| when we're making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| But as someone who really champions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| strong public processes, this is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| where I feel like our meetings with public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| provide opportunity for public comment, public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| You know, I always try to take an extra effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| to have public conversations and events or videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| to try to help get information about my initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| But I do think this is different than the pension process, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| has much, much greater implications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| whereas this, to me, is kind of a quick fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8380)|
| 2:19:47| to our electoral system that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| prevent issues in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| And so that's why I was hoping we could continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| the discussion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| But you can still vote for this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| and we can continue the discussion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| And if you don't like the answers you get next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220628?start=8407)|
