| 2:50:32| They were not a competitor when they wrote these folks up for violation after violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10232)|
| 2:50:37| One of them, they even suggested that they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| Mr. Mays, I might have to ask you to bring it to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| Well, I'll just say that one violation, they were caught with some material that they were selling to the public that tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| high enough in arsenic that the state asked them to put it in a class one landfill if they can't get it into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10248)|
| 2:50:56| And this was sold to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| I started this as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| I was just being nosy trying to find out what my competition was selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| And I thought I would jump on the detailed finance report, see how much they were paying, divide it by $1.50 a yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| and I'd know how much my competition was selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| And what I stumbled into here has made me sick as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| And I have been discredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| I have been told that Len Mays was my father, that we were in cahoots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| It's been told that I've been trying to steal their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| I didn't even bid on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| This has nothing to do with anybody who's bidding on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| Everybody's tried to discredit me, but how do you discredit the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10292)|
| 2:51:36| How do you discredit Louisiana?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| How do you discredit Knox County suing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| How do you discredit all these factual evidence from people who are qualified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| I'm a citizen in this county, and I have to ride down my street here recently and see kids sitting in this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10305)|
| 2:51:53| waiting on the school bus, and I can't say a word, and I have knowledge of what this means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10313)|
| 2:52:02| And I have been put through the ringers, folks, for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10322)|
| 2:52:07| You all don't know how I got involved in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10327)|
| 2:52:10| Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10330)|
| 2:52:11| And I guess I won't be able to tell you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| I think you have told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| Well, I haven't told you why I got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| I just wish to thank you all for listening to me, and I wanted to make a quick apology as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10340)|
| 2:52:26| Last week, I said that John Evans lied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| That's weighed on my conscience a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| John Evans isn't alive to defend himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| And I don't know if John Evans lied, and I don't know if maybe he was just misinformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| like I believe Bruce Weitrick was misinformed, but that was in poor taste on my part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| and I wish to apologize to his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| But I am telling you all the truth, and I have the documents to prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10373)|
| 2:52:58| And I am concerned as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| You cannot let things like this happen on our watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10381)|
| 2:53:05| I'm concerned over these wells, and I'm not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| I'm not qualified to make determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| But when I see bad lab results on these ponds, and they rupture into the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10390)|
| 2:53:15| and the next-door neighbors are on wells, and nobody tells them to test their well water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10395)|
| 2:53:19| and I beg my public officials for a year to notify the neighborhood to test their well water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10399)|
| 2:53:24| because I understand the implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| And I've seen the lab results with these fecal coliform counts through the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10406)|
| 2:53:31| and the next-door neighbors a few hundred feet away on wells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10411)|
| 2:53:34| and nobody will tell them to test their wells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| These things worry me at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| These things weigh on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| I started this being a nosy businessman, but I'm finishing this as a concerned citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| and I'm telling you there's nobody that will ever back me down from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| and I will be here at every single solitary county commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| until something is done about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| A couple of questions for Mr. Wheatry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10441)|
| 2:54:07| I just want to make sure that I fully understand going forward what the situation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10447)|
| 2:54:15| You in your opening kind of statement said that when Commissioner Moore was asking you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10455)|
| 2:54:21| was this part of the contract that it was part of the request for proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10461)|
| 2:54:26| but then he said, did we promise them anything in terms of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| And you said, I think you said no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| As I read the contract, the amendment, which I think is part of this reference in three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| or four locations, that request for proposals were, I mean, that process was part of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10479)|
| 2:54:47| and it seems to be an attachment at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| So is it or is it not a part of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| I believe it is part of the contract, but I think the way the county worded the tonnage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10492)|
| 2:54:57| I don't think it was a stone guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| We were guaranteeing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| We were telling them what our predictions were on the amount of green waste that would be generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10503)|
| 2:55:08| and brought to that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| But your statement was 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| And you didn't back off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| You even said two or three times, so 30 or 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10516)|
| 2:55:19| So if I'm a conscientious, you know, businessman wanting to put a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10519)|
| 2:55:25| wanting to bid on this contract, I mean, can you see how a person would have expected at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10525)|
| 2:55:32| 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| Absolutely, and I think part of this is what Mr. Major brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10533)|
| 2:55:36| You know, John Evans isn't here to speak with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| John Evans basically dealt with them through this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| I mean, I did not have these conversations with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| I had a conversation with John Evans, and what John Evans relayed to me is what I relayed to you all in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10546)|
| 2:55:51| is that, yes, he made almost a commitment that those tonnages would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10551)|
| 2:55:58| He went on to talk about with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| The big thing that I've always been concerned about or the part that I feel like the county's in breach of contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| is this second facility, this facility that forks the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| I clearly, it's clearly in the contract that we were to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| And it's also clear to me that it would be unadvisable for the county to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| and essentially start a second facility because of the costs involved and the environmental implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10579)|
| 2:56:25| Okay, and one of the initial impetus for putting a green waste facility together is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10585)|
| 2:56:31| reducing the footprint of the materials we have going to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10595)|
| 2:56:36| It's to keep us in compliance with the Solid Waste Act, which was passed back in 1994,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10596)|
| 2:56:42| a 25 percent reduction in material going to essentially sanitary landfills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10602)|
| 2:56:47| And we're able to achieve that in part by having a facility such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| But now it sounds like in this new request for proposals that we're not, that we're getting out of that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10612)|
| 2:56:59| We're getting out of the business of dealing with biosolids in a composting scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10619)|
| 2:57:03| And that alleviates quite a bit of problems dealing with runoff, dealing with whether you've got to test the material or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10623)|
| 2:57:11| Compost is a regulated commodity because of the fact it contains biosolids and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10631)|
| 2:57:18| Mulch is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| What we are doing with the new contract is essentially we're going to be a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10641)|
| 2:57:24| There's not going to be any profit sharing or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| Essentially, we're going to rent the facility and be able to use it as a green waste processing facility for it to grind up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10647)|
| 2:57:34| brush, stumps, logs, and what have you, and then sell it as mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| That is not a, that does not require a special permit from the state because you're not dealing with any biologicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10658)|
| 2:57:44| So it's not going to be a green waste facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| It'll be a green waste facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10666)|
| 2:57:49| The only component we're removing is the composting component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| You still would be able to bring brush up there, tree trimmings, all that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10671)|
| 2:57:55| and that will be generated into a mulch product as opposed to being combined with biosolids and composted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10675)|
| 2:58:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10683)|
| 2:58:04| And final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| And so how is that going to affect our mandate from the EPA as far as our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10686)|
| 2:58:13| I talked to Tom Salter, the current Solid Waste Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| Right now, we're easily making that mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| It will put us closer to that 25% threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| Right now, we're well above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| But I feel like due to the situations that we've had at this facility, it is really, it's the appropriate thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| as far as removing the composting component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| And strictly based on the fact that our ponds have failed and that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10713)|
| 2:58:40| Let me clearly clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10720)|
| 2:58:41| The ponds, we had a problem with the ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| They did develop a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| We have since corrected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10726)|
| 2:58:47| We went in and put a liner in the ponds so that that essentially, it shouldn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10727)|
| 2:58:53| In fact, that's one of the reasons why we never went to the Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10733)|
| 2:58:57| is because the money I had to use to remediate these ponds was designated for Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10737)|
| 2:59:03| So we had to divert that to repair these ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| So currently, the ponds, they are not leaking, or as far as I know, they're not leaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| There's no sinkholes in them or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| That's basically because we went in and lined the ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10752)|
| 2:59:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10755)|
| 2:59:15| But at one time, there was a problem with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| They did develop a sinkhole in them, and we did notify Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10756)|
| 2:59:25| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324businesspart2?start=10765)|
