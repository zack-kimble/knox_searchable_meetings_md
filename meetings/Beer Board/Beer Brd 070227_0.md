| 0:00:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=59)|

| 0:01:07| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=67)|

| 0:01:12| My address is 100 Brentway Circle, Apartment Number 57, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| Dr. Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| No applicable record, all applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| I think we have an individual who would like to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| My name is Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| I'm here as president of Norwood Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| We are not opposed to this beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| When Kroger and Food City offered permits, we did not object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| and we don't find any reason to object to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| I'm up here for two very quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| One, the same family owns an adjoining business called L Club Azteca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| Is our understanding that this beer permit is for the Azteca market only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| and will not give any beer sales rights to the other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| It's for one premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| The other question is a question from the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| and I'll use myself as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| Suppose I'm a customer of the L Club Azteca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| I decide that beer would go really well with my meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| Would it be permissible for me to give my waiter the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| and have my waiter run next door and bring the beer back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| And would that be something that would be permissible on a continuing basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| And that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Brown bagging is not prohibited, but not by the employees of the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| That would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| Well, just for that, the L Club Azteca, there's not going to be any more clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| Actually, the contract, the lease that we had with that building has been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| So, I mean, we don't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Is that canceled lease in effect now or is it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| This is an off-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Yes, off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Bridgeview Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| Noel Raymond, 1112 Garrison Ridge Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| That's Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Officer Hoskin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| We still need the building inspection and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| I believe both of those are on their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| And by the end of this week, I believe they'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| And we're looking at in contention of all those passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| hopefully being able to serve by March 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| I'll move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=273)|
| 0:04:43| Carino's Italian Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| John Belcastrum, 1922 Stonebrook Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| Officer Hoskin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| All applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| We still need a copy of the Knox County business license, building inspection approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| health department approval, and a final return from the former ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| When is the change in this establishment going to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| I noticed that Johnny Carino's sign today is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| So that occurs the day after tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| On Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| But you still have some documentation that has not been completed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Kyle Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| My address as well is 118 Tawicka Circle, Loudon, Tennessee, 37774.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| The actual, we're moving forward with Carino's Italian Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| The actual signage probably won't take place for some time, maybe within a year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| But just moving forward, we're in the process of purchasing out the franchisee and buying it back as the parent company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| That had to be my assumption, but it's an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Now, where are we on the documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| The Knox County business license, building inspection approval, health department approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| and final return from the former ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| And once the purchase takes place this Friday, March 2nd, we were told we couldn't actually set those appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| until the purchase had taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| So Friday morning we will make arrangements to set all of those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| Am I confused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Mr. Swanson, can you help me with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Can I help you with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Well, none of that can take place until after the change in ownership takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| However, they plan to open under the new name and the new permit on March 1st, which is the day after tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| They will not be able to sell beer under the new permit until they've completed all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| And if the old folks have gone, then they can't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| So it's either being the old beer permit has to remain in effect until the new permit is completely ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=426)|
| 0:07:16| So they're going to continually sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| They have to time it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| And we need to see their lawyers about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Well, we were told we could operate under the current license until all the paperwork came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| We were told that we couldn't set those appointments until the purchase had completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| So once the purchase had completed on Friday and we set those appointments to have all those inspections done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| then at that point in time we will start our new license and get it, I guess, get the official license at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| I'm not going to say anything about what they just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| I have nobody who might know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Is there some requirement that they can't schedule a, what is that, health department inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| and a building inspection until the ownership transfer happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| That doesn't seem to make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| That is a feeling for anybody else who's listening, you all might not have got good advice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=488)|
| 0:08:17| And the other thing I just wanted to ask about, and I had my loan originally, is Blair Bryant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| who's down as a manager on our sheet, he's listed as still owing some money to city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| And I'd sort of like to see that cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| And, you know, I never, you know, we can't use it to not give you a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| but would like to see people who owe money to the city pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| I will make sure I get with him immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| And do you mind if I look up a phone number of the lady we spoke with about the permits that said we couldn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| I have her number here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| It's probably not that critical for what we're doing here, but it would be interesting to do you have a name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| Neil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| And I have a phone number as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Is it a 215 number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| That's an 865 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| What are the next three numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| 215, 5217.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| You know, we should turn off his microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| It will be a shorter meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Mr. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| As you go forward, hopefully you heard very clearly what our council just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| We're not going to discourage you without giving you legal advice to make sure you're doing your timing correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Please pay particular attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| Councilman Petlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| That is an old lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| But I would certainly think Councilman Brown has given you very good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| And it's very important to hear what Mr. Swanson has said to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| To your future operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=589)|
| 0:10:02| I might comment on one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| I've got a little conversation going here without words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| Camille does not work in the office, in their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| Unfortunately, I believe you've called a number that could not advise you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| So, Councilman Becker, you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| I'm thinking it might be somebody in building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I'm wondering if that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| I'm actually making a note to myself to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Sir, we were actually told that when we called and inquired about all the inspections that we needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| she said that we did not need a building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| We were under the impression we did, but she said we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| And then that's when she informed us as well that we couldn't actually book the other inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| until the purchase had taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And just so I don't have the paperwork in front of me as far as exactly the legal terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| but I think we're going to continue to just try to operate under the existing license once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| until we do get those permits done and then come in and just basically swap out our other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| Mr. Swanson, help me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| I think they need legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| I think that would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| It's not our role to give them legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| And I think also you need legal advice because the officers who enforce the Beer Law are listening to all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| and I'm sure paying attention closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| So you want to be clear on what's happening, and we don't want to give legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Ma'am, do you know, has our lawyer not handled all of this, the gentleman that you've been in touch with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Tucker Herndon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| In Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| I've been speaking with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| I guess that's why I'm confused because we didn't we weren't prepped to come in and deal with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| because we were under the impression that he had already handled all the legal side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| So is there something I need to get with him and just several yeses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Mr. Chairman, I was just going to say it seems like there's a lot of confusion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| You know, if we don't get a motion, it will fail due to a lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| And then I guess we're going to he's going to forfeit his $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And I would just be in support of postponing it until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| And, you know, as everyone said, you need to go get some good counsel on exactly what you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| and how you can operate or not operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| That was a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Well, I was about to say before the second came in, but I can comment on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| I don't know if that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| If we approve subject to the final documentation, which are inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| the whole issue is his timing on selling beer under which permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| And he just needs to get counsel on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| So I wouldn't be inclined to support a postponement, but more so a approval on pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| You've been forewarned and forewarned is forearmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| You know, you need to go talk to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| Well, you know, I didn't feel the sense of the beer board would be agreeable, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| But I'll pull my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I guess if we postpone this for a month, how would you all feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| To be honest with you, sir, I don't have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| I'm going to call the lawyer first thing when we leave here and find out because, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| I was under the assumption that he had already taken care of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| And, like I said, from our point of view of getting those inspections done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| we could not get the inspections done until the purchase had taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| But, once again, we didn't want to purchase unless we had a beer license to operate under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Well, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| This is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| I'm familiar with this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| I think I would tend to go along with the substitute motion or the motion now on the floor of Councilman Browns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| And with you understanding that you have some serious work to do before that final documentation would allow you to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| under the new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| And the ladies down at the end of the table here can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| So I will second his motion, Councilman Brown's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| I think, first, I need to withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| I thought you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| So we do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| It will be in the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=852)|

| 0:15:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Miss Seaton, the beer board has spoken on a number of issues tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| and I would like to reinforce how seriously we take our responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| particularly in the sales to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| And I know that's something that you'll watch carefully in your new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| But we think it's very important to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| We take that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Well, Attorney Swanson just pointed out some of the underage sales issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| And those are, I mean, adequately disclosed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| It was my impression that they were not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| In reviewing the application under the beer permit owner-manager application, under Question 7, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| have you ever been convicted of any violation of liquor and or beer laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| It's checked yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| And then under Number 8, have you ever had a beer permit revoked, suspended, or denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| It says no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| But then it says, if yes, explain, to which it says sold to minor cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| That was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I'm not at all clear what the situation is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| I see in the record, apparently the record was checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| and I don't see any convictions for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| But she says in this application, it reads to me like she was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Officer Husky just informed me that that was something that she had written on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| that they don't have any record of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| We found it in no records check at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| It has no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Could this be in another jurisdiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| Ms. Seaton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Why did you write that on your application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Because there was a cadet come in and I was convicted of selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| When was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| I believe it was in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| And the story, the one up on lowness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Yes, 4329 Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Are you pretty sure you didn't get diversion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Did you go to city court and they said, you do this and then it will be dismissed if you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Diversion is what she got, which is not a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Would that not show up on your check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| It didn't show up at city court at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Counselman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Let me ask Officer Husky this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| It says under the records check, Knox County records indicate, it says DWI, August 12th of 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| conviction after plea of guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| Has that been disclosed on the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| I see sold to minor cadet and a public intoxication, which is later listed under other information under records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1117)|
| 0:18:48| I don't see it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| You might ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Public intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Did you plead guilty to DUI, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| You realize you didn't disclose it on your application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| When I was filling out the application, I was thinking beer as far as the selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| And that was so long ago, really, I didn't think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| It says in the last ten years, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| We have a motion to approve subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1175)|

| 0:20:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| It fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Three to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| You were denied the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| The vote was three in favor and six in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| How many do I need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I mean, how many would I have needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| I have to say to you, thanks for trying to be honest, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Yeah, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| You know, the reason I went that way is you put on your application something that was diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| So I think you were trying to be forthright, and maybe you just actually in reading the thing missed this other part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| Well, it was changing businesses and moving my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| I mean, if you're going to admit to something, you know, on your record with regard to selling to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| I don't know that you would intentionally try to hide, you know, a public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| No, I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| I think it may have been just a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| It was a rush, rush thing trying to get everything organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| In one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| We do take that seriously, but I commend you for trying to disclose everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Is there anything that I could do to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| You can reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Is there a chance that I would get it if I reapplied and wrote that down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| No guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| Well, I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| That's pretty much the reason that I voted to deny it is because I thought, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| you ought to be able to fill out the application correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| I was just, like I said, it was a hectic day in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| We had a lot of stuff to go over that day, and I was changing names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| changing from a sole priority to an LLC, and there were some things in there I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| So I just kind of, you know, was in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| I think to answer your question, if on reapplication the application were filled out correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| and completely, then there is the possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| I'm not saying probability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| There is the possibility that it could be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| That would be up to the beer board at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Would I have to do all the steps again as far as the building approval and the fire and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Chelsea's Grocery and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1335)|
| 0:22:23| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Christina Shockley, 4329 Lonus Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| We still need to copy the sales tax registration, the fire prevention approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| task program certification, and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| I had called for all those inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| The only thing that I didn't do was the task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| and it's because prior to I had been a, I had went through the class for the server's permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| and I thought that was the same as task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| It wasn't until today that I realized that that wasn't, but I had called for all those permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| When did you call regarding your permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| I'm pretty sure it was right out two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| Have they been scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| They had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| I mean, they came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| I have it in my folder if you'd like for me to get it, and I can give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Do you know what dates they're scheduled to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| It was supposed to have been right out two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| I have those dates in the folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I mean, if you go to your inspections, is there a date and time certain for those to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| From what I understood, they had already done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| When I scheduled them, they said that they would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Well, I think we just heard that that has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| So do I need to call and reapply for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Well, we don't know whether the inspections have occurred or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| We know we don't have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| We don't have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| And to me, that would be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| You know, there's a lot of things missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| But if the inspections have occurred and all we're waiting on is a report, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| that's a little different than if they haven't occurred and she just called today to get them scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| That's one of those issues over which she has no control as to when they file the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| I do have the inspector's names and their phone numbers written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| I mean, if you'd like for me to give you those so that you do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| No, I don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| I'm just trying to get a time frame on when you try to do your due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| It was two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| You know, if you told me you called today to try to set it up, that's a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| And if you called two or three weeks ago and it supposedly had occurred already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| I'd just like to hear what she hasn't done yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| The copy of the sales tax registration, the fire prevention approval, health department approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1464)|

| 0:24:40| Yeah, I guess just I'm always concerned about the task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| It feels like a really important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1485)|

| 0:25:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| You listed on your application a county offense in Orange County, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Could you elaborate a little bit on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| To do business in Orange County, you have to have an occupational license in addition to a business license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| and I didn't know I was supposed to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| I was very young, and so I had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| They cited me for it, and I had to go back and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| And we have in our information here that there are back taxes due on this property in the amount of more than $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1577)|
| 0:26:29| And is it my understanding, Mr. Swanson, this is from the owner of the property, and these gentlemen are leasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| Sorry, what was the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| There are real estate taxes due several years' worth on this property, more than $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| The owner's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| That's news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I had no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| This is the former Hawkeyes, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| It would be great to see a thriving business in there again, but we sure would like to see these taxes paid to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Yes, I actually just want to compliment the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I mean, we had an applicant up here a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| We forgot to put things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| And you clearly, I mean, you and Mr. Matthews both writing down sort of something happened years ago in Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| and I want you to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| I just want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| I have a question, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| The back taxes, that would be something obviously I would need to speak with the person who owns the property about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1657)|
| 0:27:48| The city will speak with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| But it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| I think I'm going to move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1679)|

| 0:28:17| Did the motion for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| It's just automatic sometimes, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Let's move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| The final documentation is complete and you can issue the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Does that mean I get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1710)|

| 0:28:56| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I still need a copy of the sales tax registration, building inspection approval, fire prevention approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| I've got the sales tax we applied today for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| We're not ready to open yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| I've had to reapply for our plans and reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| They knocked me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| I had to turn and resubmit with their notes revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| I should have that back by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Maybe I'm praying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Other than that, I'll just be waiting on them now to come in for inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| I tend to follow up on what Mr. Brown was saying earlier about inspections are something we don't have control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| as an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| So I'm going to go ahead and move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Oh, Councilman Hocus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Mr. Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| I see that you have $161 in outstanding fines that have not been paid to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Are you going to pay those anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| I can pay that right now if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| I don't know if anybody can take your money right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Is this a one-on-one session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Yes, it would be nice if you could take care of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| They say there's no time like the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Mr. Becker might be able to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Yes, I'll take any money people want to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| No, sir, you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| You've got an empty pocket fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| I just this is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| I know we dealt with this for another place in Ms. Pelos' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| I think we found an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I don't remember what the answer was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| It was property owner as United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| And this is the Broadway Shopping Center, which is a big chunk of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| Isn't that interesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Yes, it is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| The other was the Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And did we ever get to figure out what was going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| They own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| They own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| And whether it was a bequest or whether it was purchased, you know, I certainly do not inquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| But it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| That's actually cool because I get occasional complaints about the state of that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| I've been telling me I have to call somebody in, like, Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| So now it's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Not to speak for United Way, but I think those were bequests that were done for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| maybe through the Mundys or somebody in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| That's just them and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| It's my belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| And that can be a blessing or a curse depending on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| It's good cause to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=1897)|

| 0:33:47| Yeah, it's a gala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| It's our Playhouse Village gala called Dining by Design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| And it's going to be at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2033)|

| 0:34:06| And they're built by our local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| And they're going to be auctioned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| And we're very excited about this gala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2051)|

| 0:34:53| I'm going to move approval pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| Well, no, just approval because the file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Well, I'll wait for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Mr. Fisher, again, as a previous applicant, you have outstanding fines and fees listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| a total of $197 to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Are you planning on paying those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| I also own Paradise Taxi Company, so every time my drivers get tickets, I get them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| That's where that comes from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| It's just a change in ownership on the Chevron because it's had a beer permit before, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| I actually have a question for either Mr. Holcrest or I guess Mr. Donaldson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| This is in the new South Waterfront Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| The way we've got it set up, the zoning certificate in this will just, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| it will just say SW whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| And for most of those districts where it's not prohibited, this would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| That would be my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Any district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| This is actually more a question for the meeting later this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| but it struck me when this came up about how zoning is going to work for beer permits in the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| I don't know if you have an easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Only SW1 would prohibit it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| It's a business, and so everything else is applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2179)|

| 0:39:15| Ms. Day, could you repeat that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Copy of the Knox County business license, the sales tax registration from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| We're currently under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| I've got my business license right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| It's scheduled to open on April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| When do you anticipate opening, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| April 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Is this an existing business that has been a restaurant or is it new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| No, this is a shot property centers directly across from Chili's in the county on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| And it used to be Cat's Records, but they've downsized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| So you're in that little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2404)|
| 0:40:04| The development of the whole facade and parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| What would it do to you if we postponed that for a month until you get all those inspections complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| Because it's an existing older building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| We're in our third week of construction out of eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| What would it do to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| I'll take care of my documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| I've been out of town for the last four or six weeks in Denver, Colorado, on training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| So I've sort of gone through the punch list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| I'm going to make a motion that we postpone this until the March beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2434)|
| 0:40:43| And that will allow you time to get all your documentation in easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| We have a motion and a second to postpone until I think it's the March 27th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2455)|

| 0:41:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I have just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| What is DOR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Driving on a revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| Driving on a revoked license probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| That's what I'll take it for, sir, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| We didn't have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| This location right here, what, this is over across from the Malibu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| And you're going to be running it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2533)|
| 0:42:24| I'm a little concerned about what falls in the category of other information on our check of the background record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2544)|
| 0:42:33| I note that you put the driving on revoke on your application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| but you haven't listed any of the other matters that come with the strong litany of public intoxications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2557)|
| 0:42:46| and things that go back for a pretty good period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Is there any reason you didn't list those on your application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| I guess a lot of it I didn't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| I got shot about 10 years ago, and a lot of this stuff I lost memory of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| I got robbed and got shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| Is this a convenient mark that's going to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Is there one already there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Is there one there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| And those people are leaving that business and you're taking it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| I guess I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| I'll vote them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2599)|
| 0:43:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Mr. Walsh, one of the other things in this other information is that it says that right now you are a city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| $672.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Do you wear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| No, I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| I thought I had paid everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| That seems like a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| I was quite concerned about how long this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| I will note for just the record here that a number of these actually do go back more than 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| There's some early 90s here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| But there are also a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| There's an open container in 2007 that, you know, that wasn't on your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| I'm actually real concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| Councilman Hulkus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| Well, that's what I was going to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| And I'm going to ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| And I'm not comfortable in voting on this tonight until we get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| And I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| I'm going to make a motion to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And I'd also suggest to the applicant in the interim that he might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| if council should approve or beer board should approve the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| that you might consider getting caught up on those fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| It would be eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| You have been postponed until I think it's the March 27th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| That was $672.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2722)|
| 0:45:38| There's a note here saying that they no longer wish to be considered for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2738)|
| 0:45:46| Do we need a motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd070227?start=2749)|
