| 0:01:56| Well, thank you for that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| I will say I'm very grateful to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| It was a long and difficult time away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| I do want to say a special thank you to Commissioner Hugh Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| who I know went above and beyond the call of duty to make it possible for me to attend the September 1st meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=132)|
| 0:02:21| even though he was not even going to be there or be chair at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| So thank you to Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| I really just want to share a few things just about my experience and my perspective on the virus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| I did – I was infected with the COVID virus, got sick on August 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| and had about a two-week battle that was very, very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| I do not want to use this time that the Chairman has so graciously afforded me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| to talk about mandates or health boards or constitutionality or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| I know that's a different conversation, and it's one we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| But I just do want to, from my own personal experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| just take the time to say that this virus is a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| And I say that – and I know this is anecdotal, but I can only speak from my own experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| I became very, very sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| I don't have any underlying health conditions or any kind of compromised respiratory issues or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| But I became very sick, and on August 27th, I was taken to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| Fortunately, through some testing there, the advice of the doctors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| I was able to go home that day and actually began to slowly recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| and actually began to walk into recovery on about September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| But the thing I think that got my attention the most –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| because, look, there are a lot of things surrounding this virus that I don't care for at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| But having now had an experience with the virus itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| the thing that probably got my attention the most was the day that I went to the ER on August 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| there were actually six people who are within my circle of acquaintances and friends in my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=248)|
| 0:04:15| that were hospitalized with this COVID virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Several days later, my father was hospitalized for five days with the COVID virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Full disclosure, unfortunately, my dad recovered well, and he's doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| We were just concerned because of some other issues that he needed to go to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| and the doctors wanted to watch him for several days, but he's doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| And, you know, I would just say this anecdotally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Look, in my life, I have never seen a time when I had seven people within my circle of friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| who were hospitalized with the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| So I would just say this is not the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Now, I know that many people get this virus, and it's very mild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| Two or three days, and they're good, and I understand that, realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| But it also can be very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| So, I mean, look, I want to thank the healthcare professionals who are working on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| in the hospitals, at the health department, Dr. Buchanan and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| I know they've worked very long hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| And I believe with all my heart they're trying to do what's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| to keep our community as healthy and as safe as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| I'm grateful to the doctors, especially the staff at UT, the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| who really helped put my mind at ease and helped me walk into my recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| And so, look, I just make a personal plea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Listen, I am a firm believer in civil liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| I'm a firm believer in privacy and private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| and I am a firm believer in personal responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| And so I make this plea just personally to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| You know, if you have not had personal experience with this virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| your family and friends have not had, man, I am so grateful for that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| But just know that it can happen, and when it happens, it can be very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| So please, please don't make judgments about the virus itself based on the inconveniences it causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| I know they are bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| I know that, you know, they stink, and I hate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| But the virus itself is a very serious issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| and I would just say please be responsible, be respectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| and do everything you possibly can for the protection not only of yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| but especially of your family, friends, and neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=386)|

| 0:07:25| We have a number of people signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| but we also have a duty to complete the business of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| And so to balance the work before us tonight with the voice of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=451)|

| 0:07:43| But if I do not see any major disagreements amongst my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| I'm going to limit the amount of time to three minutes per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| And I'm not seeing any objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| So everybody who has signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| I'm going to call you in the order that I have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=479)|

| 0:08:14| that's okay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=494)|

| 0:09:27| In the last week, we have had five murders a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=567)|

| 0:09:57| See, don't play the Black Lives Matter card in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| because this ain't about Black Lives Matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| That's the kicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| See, Black Lives Matter is about police brutality and injustice of the justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| when a black man or white man commits the same crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| and the black man goes away for the rest of his life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=609)|

| 0:10:14| That's what Black Lives Matter is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Today, what we are here about is killing going on in our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=616)|

| 0:10:34| It ain't my problem because it ain't my people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=634)|

| 0:10:39| when the black people kill all the black people up, who they going to kill next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=639)|

| 0:11:02| You don't tell murder victim families to tell you information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Then they tell you information, and you turn around and say to them, it's hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=665)|

| 0:16:24| And he took care of it the best that he could, but eventually he was called to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| When he came back, that vine had gone everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| It had gone all over his garden and all over the surrounding gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=992)|
| 0:16:43| He knew there was something wrong when he came back, so he pruned back that plant, and he pruned back that vine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| And then he knew that in order to get rid of the vine, that he had to dig up the root.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| So he dug out the root, and he removed the vine from the garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Only then could he then replace the dead plants and untangle the remaining vines from the bushes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| and then bring his garden back up to where it should have been, to where it's beautiful again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and where people came about looking at it and thinking that it was beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| That garden is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Those flowers are the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Those bushes are the businesses of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| That vine is the Board of Health, and that vine left unchecked has gone all over and marred Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1045)|
| 0:17:34| It has destroyed businesses. It has destroyed individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| You are the gardeners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| So is Glen Jacobs. So is India Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| And it is your job to prune back and check when we have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| I know that there is a resolution that's being offered to dissolve the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| We are asking for a complete dissolution of the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| and then to go to the root, to go back to the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and to reword the documents so that this cannot happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| And in this way, Knox County will be beautiful and desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| and people will come back here, and it can be restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1098)|

| 0:18:38| Could somebody please check on Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1118)|

| 0:18:42| Can somebody on the upper deck go check that door and make sure that there's not an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| with either being able to get out or a medical issue or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1127)|

| 0:19:05| and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Hi, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you for letting me speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| My name is Debbie Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| I live at 7916 Whitcomb Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| I am a licensed family nurse practitioner working here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| On July 3rd, when the masking began, we had a total of 1,093 total known cases of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| As of this morning, on the Knox County website, the latest count shows 9,123 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1172)|
| 0:19:41| We have had an eightfold increase in COVID cases since masking began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| Clearly, masking is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| And I mean no disrespect to anyone in this room, but as I look around this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| many of you wearing a mask aren't even wearing them properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| They're below your nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| You're touching them constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| But, again, it's your body, and it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Y'all, please let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| I have limited time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I love you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| It's your body, and it's your right to wear your mask however you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| But to think that when you're constantly touching your mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| and you're wearing it below your nose, you are not preventing pathogen spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| In fact, in some cases, you may be increasing it by touching it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| touching items that other people then touch, and then touch their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| This is a very real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| There are 470,000 Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| We've had a total of 1.94% of our population knowingly contract COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| This means 98% of our population has still not knowingly had COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| or has had COVID at some point and recovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| And for that 1.94% of the population having had this over a six-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| you're allowing a health board to demand 100% of the population wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| damn the consequences for their physical and psychological harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| The health board is not thinking of our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Around a week ago, I sent each of you an email with the extensive list of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| who have denied public admittance to people despite having an exemption for the masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| When the health board passed the masking mandate, they said maybe a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| We're, what, 10, 11 weeks in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| We have had U.S. veterans that have risked their life for our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| be denied access into Trader Joe's or to Walmart or to wherever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| And according to the health board, that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| You all are our elected leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| You all have an obligation to make sure that our rights are not trampled upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| I have nothing but utmost respect for the members of the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| They cannot help the role that they were thrust into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| This is not a personal attack of any one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| But I respectfully request that you repeal the code that allowed the health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| to make these Orwellian rules over our lives and refuse to protect those who cannot wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1315)|
| 0:22:03| I have seen more crying in my clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| I have seen more anxiety and depression exacerbations in my clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| And nothing is being done by the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Their only focus is COVID and not our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| I had more, but I know I'm two minutes short, so I'm going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| And my daughter, I think, is the next one to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1340)|
| 0:22:32| I'm going to go to Allie Haney next and then Mr. Peter Easton after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| Ms. Haney, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1359)|

| 0:22:47| I want to tell you the impact COVID has on my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| When COVID first started, I was looking forward to Camp Koinia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| It is a camp for people with all types of disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| At Camp K, I get to spend a week with my friends who have disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| They get to ride horses, sing by the campfire, canoe, and have lots and lots of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| My first two years to attend Camp K was taken away from me when it was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| I work at Aubrey's doing food prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| I love my job, and I'm really good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| When the government decided to close the restaurants, I could not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| When the health board allowed reopening of restaurants, forcing masking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| I was unable to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| I have mitochondrial disorder, and my breathing, carbon monoxide, is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| In late July, my boss and my mom agreed I would try coming back to work in a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Because I was so lonely, my mom worries about breathing carbon dioxide will make me sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1426)|
| 0:23:55| But I went to work, and my choice to work safely and breathe air was taken away from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| My friends who are getting speech therapy are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Having autism is important to see us faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| I need to see your faces to help me understand words and emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| It isn't easy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| The mask mandate has taken away the ability for all my friends to be able to see faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1457)|
| 0:24:26| Some of them cannot talk and tell you they are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| I want to be their voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I understand COVID-19 can be deadly in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| But as an American, I have a right to be given information on COVID-19 and make my own decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1478)|
| 0:24:47| The health board said there were exemptions, but exemptions are not being honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| The health board isn't fighting for people like me to be able to work and to go to camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| The health board isn't making sure my friends have in-person therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1500)|

| 0:25:33| You have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| If it's all right before I start my dissertation, I'd like to pose an interrogatory to my commissioner, Commissioner Charles Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1535)|
| 0:25:45| Is that okay, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| You have three minutes, but this is not a back-and-forth question segment of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Leave that into your questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| My name is Peter Easton, and I reside at 6901 Ivy Stoneway in Knoxville, Tennessee, up in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1554)|
| 0:26:06| There's been no power given to the Knox County Health Board by the Knox County codes that allow for creating mandates with criminal penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1566)|
| 0:26:15| per the Knox County ordinances that outline the function of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| That has been noted in the recent proposal that Commissioner Ward and Commissioner Biggs has drawn up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1580)|
| 0:26:30| We've all seen it, and it's now admitted that the mandates are unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| With that said, keep in mind a mask is a medical device or attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| No one, including the President of the United States, can mandate that a healthy person be forced to wear a medical device or attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1606)|
| 0:26:56| Neither can a government entity coerce business owners to force wearing of the masks by their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1616)|
| 0:27:07| In reference to the proposal of Commissioner Ward and Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| I have read the proposal to try and fix the problem of legislative overreach by the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| However, I have to wonder, have you been set up to fail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| Does your proposal run in conflict with the TCA regulations that deal with the county health boards that exist in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1644)|
| 0:27:33| and outline their functions as long as Knox County has one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| If Knox County were to choose to dissolve the health board by repealing the Knox County codes that created the health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1658)|
| 0:27:50| that TCA law would not apply because there would be no health board to contend with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| The functions of government would be run by Mayor Jacobs and you as a legislative body of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1678)|
| 0:28:07| That's where the voters would see their accountability, and you would have the consent of the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1687)|
| 0:28:17| Unless I'm mistaken, it will take two readings for the Commission to pass this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1697)|
| 0:28:26| This month being the first, next month being the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| and I have to wonder if some office either with the county or the state or a judge from a law court will mention that it is not lawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1711)|
| 0:28:42| You know there's going to be challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| We all know it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| After it is struck down or after it is found not to be constitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| then we're back to the original problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Please wrap up your comments, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| If I may finish, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| It is with that said that I would support an urgent action via an emergency resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| to dissolve the health board and the unconstitutional mask mandate by repealing the Knox County codes that created the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| I had initially submitted that in a letter to my commissioner, Charles Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| and for some reason it has not made the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| I have to ask why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you, Mr. Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| Glenn Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Sir Glenn Stafford, please state your name and your address to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| My name is Glenn Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| I live at 2916 Whitcomb Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today regarding what I and many others see as an overreach of the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| I ask each and every one of you to consider the following concerns that I have, both as a Knox County resident and as an American citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1803)|
| 0:30:11| First and foremost, I am the stepfather to a medically vulnerable young lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| so I do not take the possible health complications of COVID-19 lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| But I do know that many people in government and in the media have made a mountain out of a molehill regarding this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| From everything I've heard and read, although COVID-19 can be deadly to some, there is still a 99 percent recovery rate, 99 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1827)|
| 0:30:39| Let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| In no way am I belittling those who have died from this virus, nor am I disregarding those who have serious risk from this illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| I know that it's terrible for certain individuals, and I want those people who are at risk to stay home, stay safe, and stay healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1848)|
| 0:30:56| But what gives the health board the right to quarantine the rest of us who are perfectly healthy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| People have had no known exposures, and you want us to do it for weeks and months on end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| We're supposed to run and hide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| We're Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Where's the logic in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Where are your endorsements for a healthier living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Who among you is going public and encouraging organic diets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Who's screaming for us to get more exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Drop weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Strengthen our lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Check your vitamin levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| The rules that the health board have created regarding masking are utterly ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| First, they gave us a list of exemptions that they aren't even enforcing or following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| Second, most people who are wearing masks aren't even doing it properly to prevent any spreading, thus causing more harm than good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| I find masks sitting in empty shopping carts, on the grounds in the parking lot, on the faces of people driving alone in their cars, which just saturates the mask further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1905)|
| 0:31:59| I see masks on people who are out walking by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Shouldn't they be trying to get as much fresh air and oxygen as possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| When I'm in the grocery stores, I see people wearing masks with their noses sticking out over the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Sorry, but in school I was taught that both the nose and the mouth were part of the respiratory system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| Third, people are being kicked out of places for not wearing a mask, even when those people state they have a valid medical exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| But these businesses are not honoring these medical exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| I ask each of you, why are you not defending these citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Why are you not holding the health board accountable for not protecting them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| With their medical exemptions, why aren't businesses being fined for failure to follow up on the exemption part of the mandate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| Lastly, what is with this 11 o'clock p.m. curfew they've implemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| What scientific data shows COVID-19 germs get stronger at 1059 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| Mr. Stafford, your time is up. Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| Ms. Sherry Garrett, please approach the podium. State your name and your address for the record. You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=1988)|
| 0:33:22| And I would ask the audience to please keep the commentary during the speaker to a minimum and a respect for all speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| My name is Sherry Garrett. I live at 7900 Sharp Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| It was Mahatma Gandhi who said, a nation's greatness is measured by how it treats its weakest people, weakest members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| So let's talk about some of our weakest members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I have some stories here that I gathered throughout the week to tell you all about what's going on with the constituents in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| In the facility where I work, the patients are not allowed out of their rooms for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| They used to come out for therapy, but about a month ago, they decided no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| They have to stay in their rooms at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| We are allowed to take a few outside, but not everyone is appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Our hands are tied as to how we can help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Walking 20 feet in their rooms doesn't do much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Keep in mind, we are tested weekly and have no cases in our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| Imagine staying in your bedroom, oftentimes with a roommate, for months on end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Most aren't even allowed outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Many lay in bed all day long where they used to get up and go to activities throughout the day and eat in the dining room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| They're getting weaker and weaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| And therapy is very limited due to the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| For the staff, we are forced to get tests weekly or it's considered our resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| We have to wear a mask and a shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| If any of the residents go out to the doctor, they're put in quarantine rooms where we also have to wear hot plastic gowns and gloves along with our masks and face shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| Oftentimes, we are soaking wet with sweat and lightheaded after working in those rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| So, imagine needing to go to the doctor for anything and being taken out of your bedroom and stuck in a different room by yourself for a minimum of 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| Not to mention, of course, not being able to see your families for seven months ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| My husband's 99.5-year-old grandmother hadn't seen her family since March, got depressed, quit eating, and died of loneliness last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2103)|
| 0:35:13| My husband's dad was put in the hospital the next day and was sent to a nursing home, and we couldn't see him for the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| He ended up back in the hospital with bed sores and lack of care at the facility, amongst other problems, which also wouldn't have happened if family had been allowed to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2119)|
| 0:35:27| My grandfather passed away in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| He had been in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| They discharged him but told him he needed to see a specialist about his heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| He was unable to get an appointment because of the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| He died a few days after being released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| These restrictions truly have killed people and not due to the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2142)|

| 0:35:54| At the burial, we had to maintain social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I still have not been allowed to hug my grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2156)|

| 0:36:17| Because these are your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| These are the people that you represent, and somebody needs to represent them and speak up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2183)|

| 0:36:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2199)|

| 0:36:59| I moved here from Southern California, where I've lived more than 50 years my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| I thought it was the most beautiful place on earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| This is a nice place to come to, but I didn't come here for the beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I was driven out of my home state because of liberties being taken away from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| And I'll tell you, one of the ways they do it is by unelected boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| And I'm seeing that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Please don't clap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2245)|

| 0:37:30| I have worked for congressmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| I've been very involved in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I know how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| You all campaigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| You went to people's houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| You met them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| They gave you some money, tried to get support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| You walked some doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| You put up some signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| But you told people your values, and you told them you would represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| And you have given that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| I'm disturbed to see that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| I'm disturbed to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| I did a lot of research on where I could come to have some freedoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| and I'm disturbed to see that happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| But this isn't about COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| By the way, my household has had members with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I'm glad you've recovered, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| This isn't about people's livelihoods being taken from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| I'm a licensed mental health therapist here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| The suicides I've seen, it's not about that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| The hopelessness that you're putting in our teens, it's not even about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| This is about one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Who is running Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| You were elected, and you've all given that up to a health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| and I've watched their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| And I don't think they have the same values you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| At least I hope they don't from what I've read about your bios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| And you've given it up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| We can't vote them out, but you can dissolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| And it's really important to dissolve them because it's not about COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| It's not about the masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| It's not about the businesses or the suicides or the child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| It's about unelected people telling us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| So I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Let me find my little thing because time's running out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| and I wanted to make sure I made my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| This is a watershed vote for you, and I personally will keep track of your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| This is one of those things that will define you as a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And you either dissolve the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| or I will make sure to find somebody to replace you in this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| or whatever position you ever run for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| because you have a responsibility to represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| And if you're going to give that over to Maria Hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| and other kind of wacko people on a health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| then you don't deserve to ever be elected again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Please do the right thing, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2392)|
| 0:40:07| My name is Vernon Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| I'm due to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| I'd like to know if I can give my time to this gentleman to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| so he may get his whole process through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| We planned for five minutes, and that was limited without notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| so that's the logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Mr. Henry, you can give up your time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| One second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I want to also ask, is Ms. Teresa Sexton, has she arrived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| I only keep asking because she was traveling from very far away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| and contacted us many times this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| So I am able to give my time to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| I will give you five minutes, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| And Mr. Henry, I will take you off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Coming up next in the on-deck circle would be Mr. Todd Fromeyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| Mr. Benjamin Ream, Mr. William Wilson, Ms. Julie Gautreaux,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| and Ms. Allie Cohn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Please make your way to the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| I assume you're Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| If you would please state your name and your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| and I will give you five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| and then I will revert to the three-minute mark thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2462)|

| 0:41:13| flow from Tennessee Code 68-2-603.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| It is important to note that in this statute creating the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| for a County Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| there is no power over the Board given the County legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| except removal of members for cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| or the ability to dissolve by revoking the ordinance creating the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| In terms of conflict between the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| and the regulations of the County Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| the statute states regarding the general powers of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| that it shall adopt rules and regulations as may be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| or appropriate to protect the general health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| and safety of the citizens of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| The regulations shall be at least as stringent as the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| established by a state law or regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2517)|

| 0:42:12| The statute specifically states that their authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| supersedes a less stringent or conflicting ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| I would say that includes a resolution by this body as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| While I agree the Board is acting inappropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| it would seem the current resolution is trying to make two wrongs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| a right by violating state law or being unlawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2550)|

| 0:42:37| is to recognize that a County Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| is an unnecessary institution that might have served a purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| in an era of less sophisticated information systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| but in our digital age it has outlasted its value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| For the opposition to the dissolving of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| to say we cannot manage under the same system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| 89 other counties in Tennessee have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| is for them to say the rest of Tennessee has failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| in its response to this health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Because this is not a lawful resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| the City of Knoxville will likely reject it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| resulting in county citizens inside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| suffering under the KPD enforcement of the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| because the Board will still exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Under this confused situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| businesses outside the city will be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| that this resolution isn't lawful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| and so under the confused state created by the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| these businesses will default to compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| to the Health Board so as to not risk their necessary licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| It seems that the rationale for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| is that the Health Board has violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| the constitutional rights of the citizens of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| and so in a situation where there are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| federal judgments also affirming this claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| in regard to mandates or elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| our elected body is about to stipulate constitutional violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| that are suable for damages in federal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Thus, the Commission would be eliminating the need for a trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| and enabling an immediate judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| moving straight to the awarding of damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| This does not seem a wise action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| Instead, a simple emergency ordinance to rescind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| original ordinance creating the Board is a wiser direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| Our 89 sister counties still have effectively managed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| county health departments without a county health board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| I remind you that in doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| we are not becoming unscientific buffoons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| as I suppose some are concerned we will be labeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Instead, we are joining the other 89 counties in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| that are all subject to health regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| from the state health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| For those concerned that this will cause a loss of autonomy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| allow me to remind you that your local health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| by law, would have to at least match statewide regulations anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| All we gain by a local health board is the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| to be stricter than the statewide regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| I suggest the Commission use the power of emergency ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| and emergency meetings to fast track the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| while still adhering to the legally obligated public notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| so that there is a special meeting this Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| for a first reading to be followed by a second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| on this Monday of an emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Then a second emergency meeting on the following Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| to vote on the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| This gives us a two-week timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| The logic for exercising an expedited timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| is to quickly bring Knox County out of the state of being liable for lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| by pushing back that liability to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| I had a brief interaction trying to buy a bottle of water today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| with a business owner next to the brown bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| When I told him what I was here for, he thanked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| and wanted you to know he gave up his downtown apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| and has taken two jobs in this city for other restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| so he can pay his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| That's what this has done to our city and our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| Mr. Fromeyer, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| State your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| You have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Todd Fromeyer, 1551 Lawrence Glen Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, I'm here to speak about the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| to add a citizen member to the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| specifically the process that seems to have been followed so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| in selecting that citizen representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| I'm heartened from reading the Compass article this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| that Chairman Jay is going to follow the usual process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| of accepting applications for the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| because I note that last week, according to another Compass article,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Commissioner Biggs came up with the idea of proposing Randy Burleson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| a local owner of several restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Curiously, though, Commissioner Biggs thought it was appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| to run that name by Mayor Jacobs, who is a member of the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| or at least that's what Mr. Burleson said in an interview he gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| I guess I would ask Commissioner Biggs if he thought that he should also run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| by the other members of the Board of Health, and if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| why would Mayor Jacobs get to vet the potential citizen appointee to the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| but the other members of the Board would not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Like I said, I'm glad the commission is going to follow a formal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| in selecting the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| I have nothing against Mr. Burleson personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| I've never heard his name before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| And maybe the citizen representative should be someone from the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| But if so, that person should not be handpicked from the ranks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| of the well-connected moneyed interests of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| and have to have the Jacobs stamp of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I think the commission is going to get many well-qualified candidates for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| I believe the commission should choose someone other than Mr. Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| But this brings me to a larger point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| The commission needs to start to act like the independent body that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| rather than being enthralled to the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Last week, a disturbing video narrated by Mayor Jacobs hit social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| It was hosted by a shadowy group called Freedom Forward Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| The video was there, and then it was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| The mayor said in an interview he co-wrote the text of the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Now, I could probably write a thesis paper on the disturbing words and imagery in the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| I could go on about how Mayor Jacobs talks about the blood of patriots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| and how we're under attack, the chaos that is engulfing the country can happen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| or point out the hypocrisy and warning of violent mobs creating an atmosphere of division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| hatred, and fear when the mayor's words and video do that very same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| Instead, I'm going to point out that the mayor's video showed a screenshot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| of the Knox County Board of Health when he intoned the words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| I'm here to say that I don't believe that any of the members of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| are attacking us in a sinister way or any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| If there is any attacking going on here, it's Mayor Jacobs attacking the body of which he is a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| If there's anything sinister going on here, it's the behind-the-scenes machinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| of Mayor Jacobs and his various supporters working to impugn and undermine these fine public servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| It's disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| I propose that this commission should take upon itself to do the opposite of what Mayor Jacobs is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| You, elected representatives, should be supporting those who are trying to help us make it through our day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| and be able to spend time with our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| You should be supporting those that are working to keep us healthy and safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| Don't join the politicians who are trying to divide and scare us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| You know that the Board of Health is following the science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| You know they're doing their very best in very troubling times to keep us all safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| Don't fall for this nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Vote in favor of letting the Board of Health keep doing its job. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you, Mr. Fromeyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=2974)|

| 0:50:30| and where I have observed people almost entirely complying with the reasonable mandates of the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3030)|
| 0:50:37| which is made up almost entirely of reasonable people who work in health-related fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3037)|

| 0:50:50| I am dismayed by any movement to dismantle the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| because of the fact that they are doing their jobs in safeguarding the health of our local population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| in the midst of a pandemic that has killed over 200,000 Americans in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| and which is escalating in Knox County not because of – sorry, only because of noncompliance with safety guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3066)|

| 0:51:29| I'm speaking to the second resolution put forth by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| The job of Board members is to protect the health of the local population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| and they have done and continue to do a courageous job in dedicating themselves to that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| This attempt to eliminate the Board is an attack on the safety of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| The creation of a seat for what will no doubt turn out to be any member of the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| is not rooted in a concern for the lives of ordinary citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Its purpose is to weaken and ultimately neutralize a body of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| whose sole commitment is to all our health and survival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Anecdotally, half of my family resides in Europe, where we saw what COVID unchecked did in Italy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| Enforced masking and social distancing worked to control the virus in the countries that did enforce it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| and only when those policies were relaxed did spikes recur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| Talk about impact? I'm barred from seeing my family in Europe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| because my passport won't be recognized anywhere on that continent right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3155)|

| 0:52:47| But I can't do that because of the willful, petulant noncompliance of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| that cause inconsistent results in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| because of places outside of Knox County that don't impose these reasonable restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| We are lucky that we have a Board of Health that gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| We are lucky that we have a Board of Health that is doing everything it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| to suppress this virus in our community so that we can get back to our normal lives as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3193)|

| 0:53:29| Everyone, we have opposing sides to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3209)|

| 0:54:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3250)|

| 0:54:26| especially regarding regulatory agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| I have served on boards like the Knox County Board of Health under two governors, Alexander and McWhorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| I have spent 33 years being one of those sinister bureaucrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| I'm here tonight to tell you that this board is absolutely essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| and even though they were created by the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| any official position, like a resolution that you guys take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| will be known as the position of Knox County and the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| I shared with you my credentials, part of them anyway, for one purpose and one purpose only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| and that is to try to give some credence to my comments and hope that you find them and they have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3312)|
| 0:55:21| We look to our members of government, elected or appointed, to provide guidance, to provide protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| and to address the issues that state statute may not be able to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| and more specifically, issues that happen in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| A state law applies to 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3342)|

| 0:55:50| You guys, Mayor Jacobs and the Knoxville Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| These people are on the board because they have training, experience, and they can advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| They also have the authority to make decisions when we will not make them ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| There would not be a need for the Knox County Board of Health to issue additional regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| if we would do what we were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| I would hate to think that what the account of deaths would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| if the Board of Health had not done some of the things that they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| They are not sinister bureaucrats, and they are not ordained by the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| They are, in fact, ordained by the lives that they have saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| I think that one thing is that we need to remind ourselves, and that is the bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| the take-home lesson from all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3414)|

| 1:02:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| I'm here speaking for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| My kids are grown, and they're out of the house, so I'm not at risk for embarrassing them in school or putting them at risk of being shunned by classmates or anyone else that could affect them in a negative way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3743)|
| 1:02:37| I'm here to try to speak for the business owners who would love to be here, but they're afraid of repercussions from the Knoxville Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3757)|
| 1:02:46| I am pleading to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| The Knoxville Board of Health has great intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| They are accomplished people in their field, but they don't have the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| They can't see how it's affecting the people who didn't get diagnosed for breast cancer because they couldn't get a mammogram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3776)|
| 1:03:05| I mean, this is bigger than COVID, and, you know, mammograms, colonoscopies, all kinds of medical patients who have heart issues, they're afraid to go to the emergency room because, you know, they're having chest pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3785)|
| 1:03:18| They can't go because they're afraid they're going to get COVID, and then they die at home because they didn't seek attention for their medical care when it was preventable, you know, the damage was preventable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3798)|
| 1:03:30| So I'm here speaking for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| I'm here speaking for especially our children who are being indoctrinated, and the fear is being put into them that if they don't wear a mask, they're going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3812)|
| 1:03:44| Well, it doesn't even hit children the same way that it hits adults, and there are plenty of medical studies to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3831)|

| 1:04:06| I have a law practice that I've been involved in for 25 years in the local area, and I'm stunned by the audacity of state and local governments to undertake the shuttering of businesses and disruption of life unprecedented in this history of our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3846)|
| 1:04:20| And an attack on the order of liberty that all of our citizens are supposed to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| And it's my legal opinion that the County Board of Health is exposing this county and its taxpayers to lawsuits, including lawsuits for damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3865)|
| 1:04:37| A little bit about my accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| It was my legal opinion when I read in the newspaper about what McIntyre did to John Peach and Bill French when he committed viewpoint discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| It was my legal opinion at that time that he committed viewpoint discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| I called up my friend Bill Becker from Freedom X, who I know through Alliance Defending Freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| We're both Honor Guard members of Alliance Defending Freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| I said, Bill, do you want to get involved in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| He said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| And so I contacted John Peach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| We filed suit, and I was so correct, of course, that the law director's office didn't even file an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| They just ran up the white flag and said, you got us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| And you all voted on damages to pay to Freedom X and me and John Peach and Bill French.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| So I know a little bit about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| I was also the attorney that filed suit against Knoxville when Mayor Rojero said that she wasn't going to allow carry permit holders to enter into Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3924)|
| 1:05:34| I was backed by Tennessee Farms Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| And the only reason that that case ended up moved is the legislature, General Assembly, fortuitously amended that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| So it's my opinion that the county is exposed, of course, to declaratory judgment action regarding the mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| because anybody that doesn't have COVID or is asymptomatic, there's no proof whatsoever that these masks are effective in slowing the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3950)|
| 1:05:58| And so, therefore, they're going to have a real interest in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And unless the county has proof, they can't enforce these mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| It's a violation of rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| Also, there's a Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment right to pursue an occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3967)|
| 1:06:15| That's not just a crackpot lawyer theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| This was validated by Judge William Stickman out of the Western Pennsylvania Federal Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| And he said that these rules that you can have some businesses open and some not open, those are arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| Thus, there is no rational basis for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| And that exposes this county to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Now, of course, if under color of law people are being deprived of their rights, then a Section 1983 lawsuit may lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| And that involves damages and attorney's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| But we have our own homegrown takings clause in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| It's Article 1, Section 21, which states that no man's particular services shall be demanded or property taken, etc., etc., without just compensation being made therefore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| Now, the Supreme Court has found that the Fifth Amendment right in the United States Constitution is self-executing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| And I don't think there's any reason why this wouldn't be self-executing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| But the Tennessee one is different because it not only talks about property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| It talks about no man's particular services, and that is their right to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| And so I think under the Tennessee Constitution, there's going to be a claim against the county for all businesses who have been shuttered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| And it's the county board of health that's doing this, and you're allowing it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| And so why am I doing –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| Wrap up your comments, sir. Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Just a few more seconds, please. I also prepared five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| I'm doing this because of the old Edmund Burke statement that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4052)|
| 1:07:41| And so you all – it's evil, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| Not only do I think it, but the people that drafted the Tennessee Constitution and voted on it thought it was evil for somebody's services to be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| A regulatory taking that takes their services, that keeps them from working, they thought it was evil, and they put it in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| And you all are allowing this evil to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| It's evil to take somebody's services and expect them to bear the loss and not the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| That's evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Now, you can do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| This measure that you're proceeding with, that is preempted by the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| That's not going to cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| You're going to have to terminate the county board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| You're going to have to repeal that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4101)|

| 1:08:53| Oh, you're Rick Roach. I'm sorry. I thought you were Charles Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| Okay, Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Please state your name and address for the record, and Charles Craig, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| I just did. Did you get it recorded? I'm not repeating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| I've served on two advisory boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Please state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| Rick Roach, 2404 Victoria Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you. Sorry, we could not hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| I've served on two advisory boards, one for the city and one for a combination city-county board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| Neighborhood Advisory Council for the city of Knoxville and the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| They were advisory boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| Okay, so that's all they did was advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Hardly ever did county commission or city council follow the advice of these advisory boards, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4175)|
| 1:09:43| We were volunteers. We didn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| We put in a lot of time, a lot of work, and we tried to do due diligence to what we were tasked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| The Board of Health was appointed by you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| So they're going to do the bidding that you instructed them to do under Tennessee Code Annotated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| and whatever other regulatory coverings that they have to work under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| So what is the problem with you not giving guidance to the Board of Health, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| The reason we're in this position right now, let's be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| Back in March and April, we had a county mayor that didn't really take hold of this, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| and did not want to implement common sense, common sense practices for the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4229)|
| 1:10:37| If that had happened, we wouldn't be here right now, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| We would not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| And you all know it, okay, but you let it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| So you all have to take responsibility for that also, at least the previous county commission as constituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| And I think at the end of the day, if we sit up here and we let a lot of noisemakers come up here and talk about the science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4254)|
| 1:11:04| we don't know about the science all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| The people who are medical doctors and who deal in those areas, they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| Listen, we've got classifications right now of active and inactive cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| You notice that last word I used, inactive, it was changed from recovered, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| There's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| The CDC did that for a reason because inactive more accurately reflects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| This thing changes day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| The conditions change day to day, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| You have to be flexible enough to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| That's what has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| That's what has not happened in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| And people are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| I just had a woman who was my second mother just die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| She didn't have COVID-19, but guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| And I'm going to ask for my extra minute that everyone else has gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| But she died thrice, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| There won't be a normal funeral for her and her family and her friends and her loved ones, okay, to come and remember her, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4325)|
| 1:12:15| So everybody's going to suffer a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| But if we have had a little bit of sacrifice and a little bit of common sense at the very beginning of this whole thing back in the spring, we wouldn't be here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4337)|
| 1:12:26| And every one of you, again, I emphasize this, every one of you know it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| And it's time for you all to step up, okay, and act like adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Mr. Charles Craig, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| Please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| Mr. Craig, please address the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Give us your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Charles Craig, 7766 Belchase Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| I want to say that I was one of the people who was most proponent when this started of wearing a mask, social distancing, being careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4382)|
| 1:13:11| I've worked both in and out of the medical field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| I've worked with people who have compromised immune systems, and I did not want to see any of them die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| And while the numbers were unknown, I was willing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| I was willing to do whatever it took to keep people from dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| But I have to wonder when I see that while nationwide it's different, in Knoxville, we had 2,100 people die of the flu last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4409)|
| 1:13:40| I know COVID does not have that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| I'd have to look at the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| I think it's about 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| My question is if and I understand COVID for people who are immunocompromised is a very dangerous disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| But my question is, why was the Board of Health not mandating masks last year with flu if it was that deadly in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4434)|
| 1:14:04| Why are we here at this point for COVID and not for that for flu or some of the other pandemics that have happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4444)|
| 1:14:12| So I do not necessarily like dissolving the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| But if we do not feel like we as the people have representation with what is being legislated, that is harmful to the American way of life and the American way of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4458)|
| 1:14:35| And I do not want to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| I do not wish to have to take drastic steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| But if that's what's required, that may be what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Thomas, Deborah Thomas, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| Raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Ms. Thomas, please address the commission, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you for letting me speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| My name is Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| I live at 428 East Burwell Avenue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| I have been watching the Knox County Board of Health meeting since June and have been impressed with the professionalism and preparedness of the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| They do not make decisions lightly, but based on science and responses to measures and other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| I'm against the resolutions that might limit the powers of Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| And I'm also against a citizen appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| If that citizen is from the restaurant business, then it is a conflict of interest, much like assigning a fox to watch a hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4537)|
| 1:15:45| Knox County Board members are appointed to allow them to do their jobs in a nonpartisan way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| Our metro area needs an independent board that can adjust regulations to meet the community's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| Not a generic recommendation from the state level that might be fine for smaller populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| This is not about individual liberties, but doing what is best for our community and taking care of the most vulnerable, including the elderly and those living in crowded conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4562)|
| 1:16:11| Let the powers of the board remain intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| You don't change the rules in the middle of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| These issues can be addressed at a later time when the county is not in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| Don't let us be held hostage by bar owners and people that don't understand the necessity of wearing masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| Businesses will be further impacted if there's a second wave, or worse, if we don't get this first wave under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| And I would also like to point out that people that support the mask mandates and crowd limits are going to be very hesitant to come down here to this arena and to venues like this where there are large numbers of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4592)|
| 1:16:44| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Thank you very much, Mrs. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Terry Titchell, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Last call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| Teresa Sexton, have you joined us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| She has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| Kevin Murphy, I'll call your name again on number 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| That concludes the portion of public forum for the Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4626)|
| 1:17:13| The next item of business is our amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| The first item are the additions to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| I'm going to do this in two parts, the first part being the resolution that came in after the agenda was published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4645)|
| 1:17:34| That would be Resolution R-20-9-907, submitted by Commissioners Ward and Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| That came in after the agenda was published, and then we'll go to the additional additions thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4660)|
| 1:17:49| Madam Clerk, would you please read in the caption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| The first item on our agenda would be to determine if we're going to add R-20-9-907 to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4676)|
| 1:18:06| Sorry, just clarifying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4686)|
| 1:18:18| So the first item on our agenda would be to determine if we're going to add R-20-9-907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4698)|
| 1:18:26| Mr. Law Director, if I'm correct, that takes a two-thirds vote by Commission to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4706)|

| 1:20:20| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4820)|

| 1:20:23| I have an addition as well I'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| You have another addition to be on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Yeah, I have another resolution I'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| We're in the middle of a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| My light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Then I'm going to hold that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| You have an additional, a brand-new agenda that no one has seen yet, a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| Well, this was actually included in the agenda committee meeting, but my resolution was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| whenever it was placed upon the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| So, I'd like my original resolution R-20-9-111 to be added to the agenda pursuant to Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| Code Annotated 68-2-601 and appointing Randy Burleson to serve as the representative of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Can I have a copy of that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| Mr. Law Director, I'm going to read a prepared statement I have related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| And I'd like for your, I'm going to hold the other vote on the other additions until this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| and I'd just like for you to help us sort through this, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| This is related to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| I'll ask the Law Director this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| We could go ahead and vote to add those items and then come back to add an additional item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| Could we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| You can do it however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| It'd be, I'm making motions, so you can isolate them like you already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| You can do them all at once, however you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| I think the question becomes whether the original resolution during the agenda session was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4925)|
| 1:22:12| R29111 and in my opinion, after consultation with the Law Department, is that this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4932)|
| 1:22:22| needed to be split into two different resolutions or actionable items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| So that is what is a poor review on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| So the question is, I have an outline of why I thought that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4948)|
| 1:22:35| Do we debate that now and then move forward with the agenda as planned or do we add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4955)|
| 1:22:44| one issue as a third item related to the same other two items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| I mean, it's up to you, but you can all put them on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| But I want to make clear, I said, number one, whoever puts something on the agenda, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4970)|
| 1:22:58| the master of their own ship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Whatever they want on there, they can put on there and then it gets voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| You and I did have a discussion about the other parts of the rules with regard to appointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| I thought that Mr. Bigg's motion was both a motion to appoint and a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| And then this board could take up nominations from the floor and also, if they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| to accept anybody from the public that wanted to put their name in and then you vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| So what I think Commissioner Bigg's is saying, I'm the master of my own ship and that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5012)|
| 1:23:41| one I wanted on the agenda and then you can deal with it however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| Whether you want to come in and do it in two parts, as you suggested, Chairman, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| up to this commission to decide how they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Okay, so the question is, while we're trying to just set the agenda to work through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| do we, we have right now two items, these are items number seven and eight that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| be pulled off of consent but that are on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Do we leave that as is and then do we add Commissioner Bigg's original resolution again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5046)|
| 1:24:14| which would then be potentially a duplicate, or do we debate this now to figure out should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| it be two or should it be one before we set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| No, I think you ought to set the agenda, follow what the commission, my advice is you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| do however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| Commissioner Bigg's desired it to be on the way it was and it got changed and I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| it was by an agreement, whether it is or isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| I've always been of the belief, get everything in front of commission and let commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| deal with it all rather than trying to say don't put this on or do put this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| So my thing is just let's let it all get on and discuss it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| Just to clarify, after my discussion with you, I did have a discussion with Mr. Bigg's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| and Commissioner Bigg's and discussed that I felt like it needed to be split into two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| I thought we had come to an understanding, we published the agenda and then soon after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| you said that you didn't want it that way and that was the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| So we, regardless of how we got here, we're here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| We have two items on the agenda and we have a wish to have it combined into one and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5116)|
| 1:25:24| have to decide how to proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| Commissioner Bussler, do you have a comment before we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| Yes, thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| We have a motion and a second on the floor right now to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| Commissioner Bigg's also wanted to add this to all in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| Now what we're asking for right now, we've got a motion and a second on the floor for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Do we have to amend the agenda for his adding on to that since we've already got a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| I would say that would be a substitute motion which would then have to be seconded and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| vote on the substitute motion to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| If that fails then it gets back to the motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| Okay, Commissioner Bigg's, how do you want this to operate since it's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| Commissioner Bussler, I could do one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| If we needed to clarify it, I could withdraw number 7 to date and I could add what we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| wanted to do if you think that would be easier or we could just flat out add my original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| resolution and whenever it comes to voting time figure out which one that everybody would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| We've got to take a vote to get it on, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| If you take 7 and 8 off and you put it as originally formed, when we get to this number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| if we then go back through and we determine that it needs to be split into two actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| not one action, can we still do that at the later time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5211)|
| 1:26:58| There's two things you're going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| Number one, you're setting the agenda and the sponsor of 7 and 8 says I want it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| To withdraw it, you have to vote to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| I was saying I wanted my original resolution to be in the place of what I stated originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5230)|
| 1:27:18| It's a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| When you set the agenda, you've got to vote if somebody says like a lot of times somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| comes in from school or something says take that one off, we don't need it, then this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| body votes on the final agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| One of the things you want to do, it's two parts, you've got to take that off and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| you want to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| And that can all be done with a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| So I believe the proper substitute motion would be for you to ask for 7 and 8 to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| removed and for this R29111 in its original form to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| Is that the substitution wish you wish to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| What happens if that doesn't get on there and then we have no opportunity to add a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| representation to the Board of Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| You have to determine whether or not you want your resolution to be on there or to not first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| before we can set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Was he finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Were you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| The original point I made, we've got a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| Don't we have to deal with that first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Unless there's a substitute, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| You have to deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| You've got a motion on the floor, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| Last year's Schoonmaker's Light was on the floor of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| I thought his was up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| At this point in time, you have officially on the agenda number 7 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| Why don't we go ahead and just add the additional resolution that Commissioner Biggs wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| do and then we can discuss those three when it comes up on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| And that simplifies everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| He shouldn't have to withdraw anything in advance because, if I'm understanding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| correctly, what you're presenting now is what your original resolution was and it was confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5342)|
| 1:29:10| by the law department and then it was changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| It was on the September, if you look on the website, it's on the September 9th agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| It's on there as it is stated right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| So why don't we just deal with the three at one time because they're going to get flushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| out at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| Can we make it like a 7A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| So it's in the middle and we're not so far gapped out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| But we can move it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| I can just move it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| So does he need to make a substitute motion to add this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| You need to make a substitute motion to add this resolution in addition to leaving 7 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| 8 on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Is that how you would see it, Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| I see your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Mr. Chair, we've made one step so far in this meeting and that's towards adding one item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| Normally we do all our ads, then our withdrawals, then our deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| So to add a deferral, I mean a withdrawal and an ad at the same time, I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| would be the most efficient way to do it to accomplish what Commissioner Biggs is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| wanting to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| I would say we already do have a motion on the floor for a first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| You didn't recognize Mr. Biggs before we had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| At that point, if I'm not mistaken, we could have discussion in a substitute to add another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| So I would suggest we add it and then when we get to withdrawals, we withdraw 7 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| That way Commissioner Biggs knows that he has added before the other items are withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| That's what I'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| To restate, Commissioner Daley, do you have a comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| I'll be voting no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| Our commission rules state that the public, anyone out here, anyone up there, can be asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| their name to be put in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| In so doing, I'm afraid that if Commissioner Biggs goes through that Randy Berthelsen will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| be in there without the public having the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| So I'll be voting no to be adding this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| And one question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| On the agenda committee, which I think there's only been about two of them on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5481)|
| 1:31:28| committee on this commission, who sets the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| Is that the chairman's, can the chairman set the agenda and not add items or remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| First of all, the rule is that anybody who wants something on the agenda gets it in by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| the date, which is what, two weeks ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| And if that's submitted, then it goes on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| After that, it's up to, the chairman has discretion to add anything on the final agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5510)|
| 1:31:58| And this body has final authority at a sitting meeting to add something by a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5518)|
| 1:32:05| So you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| With regard to your issue on letting the public come in, it's something that can be done by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| just Justin Biggs' motion, simply by, for instance, you saying, well, I move to a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5533)|
| 1:32:21| motion that we want somebody on the board of the citizen, but I want to do it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| and leave it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| You can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| I mean, what you want to do can be done by substitute motion by just, once his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5548)|
| 1:32:38| is granted and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Can the chairman not add a resolution to the workshop agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5560)|
| 1:32:46| Does he have the authority to not take away Commissioner Biggs' resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| No, he has no authority to take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| The difference was one action or split into two actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| So I believe that the proper way forward at this point is we have a motion to add 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| 36, 56, 63, and 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| If Mr. Biggs would like to make a substitute motion to also add his original motion, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| is R2911, he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=5594)|

| 1:41:23| Therefore, in my opinion, we must default to and follow our Knox County Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Section M of the County Commissioner Rules clearly outlines the process for elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| and appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| M-2, rule number M-2, the procedure for appointing committee members, board members, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| internal auditor, or other appointed officers shall be as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Rule number A as part of M-2 states, each member of the commission shall have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| by roll call to nominate a person or persons to serve in each vacant position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| Nominations do not require a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| The application of a nominee for a vacant position shall represent the nominee's willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| to serve in the position if appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| The commission chair shall also allow registered voters of Knox County an opportunity to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6126)|
| 1:42:13| names to the commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| The names may be submitted in writing to the chair prior to the meeting or may be substituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| in person at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| In order for a name to be considered, a member of the commission must subsequently nominate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| The rule continues to outline the process thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| So as such, I believe that this should be the process for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| Nominations should be split into two different resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| First, establishing that we want to vote and create a member of the Board of Health as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| a citizen representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Then in a second resolution in which we will fill that vacancy as we have always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| In that process, we can very quickly go through a very easy way for people to submit their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| information to the chair in a timely period of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| And then we can bring those names for consideration according to our rules and then fill that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| position next week as we have done with every other position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| And that is why I think it should be two different actions and not one different action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| I'll look at the lights first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| Commissioner Daley, then Biggs, then Smith, then Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| I'll second your motion and agree with everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| We need to follow our own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| The substitute motion is on the table and discussion is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| Does the commission rules outweigh the TCA code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| No, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| So putting forth the commission rules above the TCA code to do what Chairman Jay just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| stated, you could basically go either way you really wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| Could you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| So if we were to substitute motion his substitute motion to allow something to play off of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| resolution that I have to also accept nominations, which I, you know, I would like for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| commission to be able to see the resolution that I just handed to Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| But would that, would we be against that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| This board can do whatever it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| I note that the item on, we're getting all caught up in some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| The number six on here, you're pointing people to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| You didn't have, take recommendations on that, it's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| If that's what you, that's what our rule states, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| You correctly stated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| It's up to this commission on how you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| It would not be a violation of state law to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| It can be done, I think, under state law the way that you said it just says by a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| without anything talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| It can be done however this commission desires to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| Take six votes and you do it however you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| So you've got a substitute motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| That would be a valid motion if passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| If not, you go back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| So what you're saying, Director Buick, is the resolution previously to this for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| BZA, Districts 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 appointed the people that are on this list with, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6311)|
| 1:45:20| we never interviewed them, didn't anything that we're talking about doing for this very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| next resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| That's correct and it's been done on most things, like with the mayor submits a name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| that he wants to be on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| That's where in the vagueness and the ambiguity arises, but you've got a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Commissioner, I think Biggs, sorry, Commissioner Smith, you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| Question for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| In the state statute it says, by resolution and election of commission, would this constitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6351)|
| 1:46:01| an election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| Can you repeat your question for me, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| The statute says, go ahead and read the first line of the resolution, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6370)|
| 1:46:18| Do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| The county legislative body, and this is exactly what the Chairman read, the county legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| body may also, by resolution, provide for the election of a citizen representative as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| another additional member of the County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| My question is, if Mr. Burleson's name is put into the blank, would this justify and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| count as an election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Not whether you call it an election or appointment, I'm not sure of the distinction that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6403)|
| 1:46:50| looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| I mean, you're going to be elected or appointed, however the wording is, by six people sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| I guess my question is, does that follow state statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| Does what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Does the process follow state statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Does which follow the state statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| The act of creating the seat and appointing it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Well, I think you can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| This board by six votes, but the motion on the floor is to split it into two processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| Commissioner Warden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| I had a question, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| Is the citizen representative a voting member on the health board or not a voting member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| on the health board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| It is a voting member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| I'd like to point out, Commissioner Biggs, also that I believe when you referred back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6468)|
| 1:47:56| like to item six, that to me falls in a very different scenario where each board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6476)|
| 1:48:06| is allowed to submit a name from their district, so everyone, in fact, has input, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6486)|
| 1:48:14| very different from the idea of adding one member that the health board collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Seeing no other discussion, I'll just add one item before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6502)|
| 1:48:30| I feel like if we're going to have rules, we should follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| I feel like when in doubt, stick to the commission rules, and when it's vague, stick to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| You may end up in the exact same position, but I believe it's better to follow the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| than to only put one person up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| So that's my final position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| Is there any other discussion before we vote on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6529)|

| 1:51:36| the Knox County Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Motion is in with no recommendation and asks for citizen's resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| Commissioner Daley with the motion and a second by Commissioner Bailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6708)|

| 1:51:54| Commissioner Schoenmaker, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| I'm just asking a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| He was asking the question whether technically the motion that you, the number seven motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| ought to be just sent on with no recommendation for a vote since it's a legislative function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6727)|
| 1:52:16| So instead of approving it, it should go forward as no recommendation and be approved next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| We approved the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Now, should it, whether or not it goes on consent or is, you're going to vote on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| that should go on consent or whether it should go forward with no recommendation to be voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| on at the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| So to me, the approval would be now that it goes on to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| So we, this body approved it and it now moves forward to next week and it is on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| It was a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| So currently the motion is on number eight and this is about filling the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| We have a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6772)|

| 1:54:33| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6873)|

| 1:54:39| Chair, is there any concern about the time frame involved here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6879)|

| 1:54:54| This seems very rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| I mean, we are deciding tonight and putting it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6896)|

| 1:55:14| I mean, you can do that with five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| And I would point out also that any nomination doesn't have to come from what the citizen's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| resume is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6924)|

| 1:55:53| And I feel like we need a citizen on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=6953)|

| 1:57:45| Thank you, Mr. Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| Open up the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| Mr. McPherson, I pulled this item from consent to have a discussion about it in a year when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7080)|
| 1:58:07| travel is reduced to virtually nothing and also in a year when the internet is easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| available to everybody in multiple forms for travel booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| I really wondered why the Knox County School Board was allocating $130-something thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| dollars to hire a travel company to book flights and hotels and I would love some opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7104)|
| 1:58:30| to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| So one thing I want to be clear about is we're not, we're actually not paying World Travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| $130,000 to actually do our booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| This is actually more aligned with the budget of the travel budget and so this is, so we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| when we go through World Travel, it allows us to take advantage of significantly discounted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| rates, particularly with airfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| And so this would just, this is just has, this is a vehicle by which we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| So, you know, it's one of those things where if the travel is taken, that it's significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7146)|
| 1:59:15| cheaper if we go through World Travel than having individual departments book their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| flights, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| So we can get, we can take advantage of significant discounts by doing it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| So the $130,000 cost is more in line with the budgeted cost of travel if those flights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| are taken or if they're, because a lot of times with grants particularly, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| travel, professional development requirements to be eligible for the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| And so anyway, the $130,000 is actually, it's not a service that we're paying to World Travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7183)|
| 1:59:51| It's just that we would go through World Travel if we booked those flights because we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| get cheaper rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| There is a little bit of a fee attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| It's probably, it's dependent upon the number of transactions, probably about $10,000 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| $15,000, but it allows us to access the system that they use for internal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7206)|
| 2:00:14| So we can actually go in through their system and automate it to the extent that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| set spending limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| We can be in compliance with county travel policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| And then there's reporting that allows us to, where we can actually drill down and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| at spending patterns to make sure no one's abusing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| So it's really more, the administrative fee is actually more for internal control purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| Thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| On your physical note, it says that the travel agency collects $7 per transaction and hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7242)|
| 2:00:53| slash car rental booking at a cost of $0 per transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| And then it says airfare booked through an agent is $20 per transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| So if you're not paying for a hotel, is it $27 then to just utilize their service for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7263)|
| 2:01:13| one flight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| So we have our business services supervisor with us, Robin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| So some of the, she's going to have a lot more knowledge about this than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| So I may ask Robin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| Because if you took the $20 fee and divided it by $130,000, that's 6,500 air flights or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7287)|
| 2:01:36| air tickets per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| So it's either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| So you would pay $20 per transaction if you called World Travel, had the agent book that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7300)|
| 2:01:47| flight for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| It's $7 if the individual employee goes online and books that travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| So then World Travel gets credit for that employee doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| They get a transaction fee, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| So we would, so if we paid $7 per transaction, then you're talking about less than $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7325)|
| 2:02:13| But that service also gives us the ability to automate workflows so that when an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7333)|
| 2:02:21| books that flight, that request goes to their supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| Their supervisor would then approve that online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| So that's a part of the software that the travel agent would provide to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| So it provides additional internal controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| In addition, it allows us to build our policies into that software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| So it doesn't allow them, for example, to book first class flights or flights that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| cost prohibitive based on our limits that we set within the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| We only pay World Travel $7, and we only pay that if we use this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7375)|
| 2:03:03| So if we don't do any travel this year, then we don't pay World Travel any fees at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| So some of it you're actually paying for the software cost that helps Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| As opposed to getting something done through our IT department or your IT department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| We have to hire internally a person to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| We booked last year, last year was not a good year for comparison, but year before we booked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| approximately 500 flights through World Travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| The year before was about 475 flights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| So that number of individuals calling World Travel to book that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| Could you state your name for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| It's Robin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| In the prior contract, we actually paid $30 per transaction, so this is actually a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| So help me out here with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| So you're saying last year 400 people flew or 400 airline tickets were issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| In 2019, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| And times 20 bucks is $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| So how does that jump to $130,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| So that $130,000 includes the airfare, the cost of the airfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| That we, so World Travel, we pay them for the cost of the flight, and then an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| $30 per transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| So you're actually including as part of the fiscal note what it actually costs totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| for everybody to fly around the country for the school system then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Yes, Ron or Chris, I guess, do we not have a Knox County travel agent that you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7482)|
| 2:04:49| use or do we not have, Chris, do we have a department that does our booking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| Well, we actually bid this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| This was actually placed for bid, and this was the winning bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| They provided the best service, according to the evaluation committee, at the lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| cost as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| So it is subject to the procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| So will, Chris, will Knox County, will the Knox County employees outside of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| system use this same or do we have our own travel agent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| I just wondering, you know, it sounds like it's going to be redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| I think, no, this is strictly for schools and, you know, they're large as far as teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7529)|
| 2:05:38| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| And so for us, internally, we just book by department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7539)|
| 2:05:47| So Jim probably has somebody in his department that does travel and does all their travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| and we have someone in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| So for us, we do it by department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| I just wonder, because it looks like we could save some money if it was all under one department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| I just wanted to clarify, so the $130,000 is the processing fees, all the costs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| the flights, and gives you access to the management system on the back, the backside management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| system for yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7582)|

| 2:06:43| Is there any way we could take a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7603)|

| 2:06:48| I'll put Knox County Commission in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| There's supposed to be no recommendations, 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7612)|

| 2:07:41| Well, we put it because it was just added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| We pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| So is there anything from the Sheriff's Office that wants to provide context on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7663)|

| 2:08:05| Motion moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| I think because it was added late, we just went and pulled everything that was added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| late to stay on the right side of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7689)|
| 2:08:17| So that vote would be 10-8-9-9-9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7697)|
| 2:08:29| Next item, please, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7709)|

| 2:09:05| To send with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7746)|

| 2:09:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| Is there a discussion on this one, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| Jim, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Yeah, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| I can speak to the good work our solid waste folks have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7768)|
| 2:09:32| These three items in particular, item 35, are related to a joint city-county bid that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| we're working with the city on in regard to our garbage disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| We're leveraging their tonnage and our tonnage and going to get a much better price, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| anticipate the savings to be almost $120,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| Again, like I said, we're still working out some finite details, but we appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| all's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| And that's the reason we want to send with no recommendation to get the details worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7796)|
| 2:10:04| out by next Monday, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| So 33 has been sent forward with no recommendation, and we have an affirmative vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| Yeah, we got a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| All in favor, please say aye to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| Chairman, can I abstain from these votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| Because it has to do with my industry, and I don't feel comfortable voting for a competitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7820)|
| 2:10:24| or against a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| So if you will, I believe 33, 34, and 35, you would probably...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| I wish to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| Wish to abstain on all three of those, so the vote on 33 would be 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=7831)|

| 2:17:00| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8220)|
| 2:17:09| First of all, thank you for all of our emergency people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| I know times are tight and we have this designated fund for $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| I've been in discussion with a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| Karnes is on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| They say that they do not accept taxpayer funding, which is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| Email today from Mr. Latham asks, why is Karnes getting funding when there are subscription-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8257)|
| 2:17:44| as rural metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| And to his point, the revenue or the income in 2018, according to the 990 filed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8267)|
| 2:17:57| Karnes Fire Department, they brought in $2,148,670 and they paid out mostly for salaries, $965,615.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8277)|
| 2:18:13| That leaves them a revenue of, this year, that leaves them a balance of $195,442, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8293)|
| 2:18:23| sorry, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| These $10,990s that I received from the Rescue Squad and Seymour Volunteer Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8304)|
| 2:18:31| are about a year or so behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| I guess the question is, why aren't we supporting the other two with the $125,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8314)|
| 2:18:42| I could not find a memorandum of understanding for the Rescue Squad, but I did find a memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8322)|
| 2:18:51| of understanding for Seymour back when Mayor Burch was there that in 2017 and 2018, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8331)|
| 2:19:00| would have went to $165,000, which they're happy to get to $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| So, my question is, with Karnes having a subscription-based program like rural metro, why are the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8345)|
| 2:19:17| having to fund Karnes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| I think, ultimately, for us, we look at fire service as fire service and not from if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8361)|
| 2:19:29| a subscription or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| And so, the reason you have Karnes on the designation list, and this goes along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| the email that I sent out today, and you may not have got to saw it, ultimately, designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8377)|
| 2:19:44| are always when you're in arrears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| And so, if you look at that spreadsheet, you will see that Seymour got funding 2017 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8387)|
| 2:19:54| 2020, and then since that's when you're in arrears, you'll see Karnes from 2018 to 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8394)|
| 2:20:01| And so, that's why you see Karnes on this list and the other two agencies are not on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8401)|
| 2:20:08| that list, because they got their money appropriated in the budget and not through designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8408)|
| 2:20:14| So, Karnes was never really on an MOU until two months ago or whenever we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8414)|
| 2:20:21| I think, ultimately, the Fire and Tactical Committee has met with the agencies and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8421)|
| 2:20:31| going to come back forward with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| They did a six-month recommendation, and so they're coming back with a full recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| This new printout is very small, so I'm trying to see the one-time per adjustment $1,600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8444)|
| 2:20:56| Could you tell us, tell the Commission what that's all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| The $1.6 million one-time pay adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| So, the $1.6 million one-time pay adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| So, you'll recall back during the budget hearings in late June, we had made the comment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8467)|
| 2:21:17| if revenues were better than we expected, that we would come back forward for an adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8477)|
| 2:21:24| for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| So, what this is is a one-time pay adjustment for what we call full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8486)|
| 2:21:33| A1 and A2, and A2 just simply means you receive benefits, but you don't work completely 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8493)|
| 2:21:39| hours, you'll work 30 or above, and they will get a percentage of the one-time pay adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8499)|
| 2:21:46| We do it as a pay adjustment because this is one-time money, so we don't want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| it as recurring funds and give a raise, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| And this has nothing to do with the Sheriff's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| How are we looking on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| No, so you all approved the bonus for the Sheriff, so that is in there, and this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8521)|
| 2:22:08| be paid at the same time as that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| This also picks up the employees not covered by the bonus in the Sheriff's office, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8531)|
| 2:22:19| it also will help to also give an additional amount of raise to those employees in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8539)|
| 2:22:31| health department that's been on the front lines as it relates to testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| We've got the report from the state that the month of July for the state looked awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| Have we got any reports of how our finances are doing for July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| I didn't ever see a July report today, and so we should have received today or tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8567)|
| 2:22:53| our July revenue from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8573)|
| 2:22:57| We have definitely got through June and know that we've closed out the year in a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| positive way, and so we've sent those things out, and I will look for July to see how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| starting off the new fiscal year, but I didn't receive an email today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8594)|

| 2:23:17| Mr. Caldwell, before I call on Commissioner Schoonmaker, can you – I asked the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| of what – there's only one type of Knox County employee this does not include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| Could you please inform us of who that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| That it does not include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| All elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| Yeah, one will include elected officials, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| And so, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| I just want to make sure that we're very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker, sorry if I stole your thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| I didn't know what you were asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| Mr. Caldwell, I've got some concern about the designation for the Carnes Volunteer Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| Department, and here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| We've got citizens in Knox County who pay a subscription to Rural Metro, and they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8634)|
| 2:24:03| get any kind of reduction in their rate because of a contribution from the Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8643)|
| 2:24:10| So, why should the folks who are subscribers to the Carnes Fire Department get a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8650)|
| 2:24:17| in their rates because they're being subsidized by the county taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| You know, I'm sure that, you know, $125,000 could be used, you know, with some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8663)|
| 2:24:33| stormwater issues that we have had off of Dutchtown Road or some new, you know, safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| improvements to some of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| But I have a problem with, one, a fire department that says they don't receive any tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8682)|
| 2:24:51| to provide their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| Number two, we've been supporting them very generously the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| But in essence, two, you know, you could look at it, those citizens who also are Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| subscribers are also paying twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| They're getting billed for their subscription, but then through our tax base, they're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| paying taxes where we're giving them money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| So, I would like to have a discussion here amongst us if, because we can make the ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| choice here, if we should remove this designation from this list and, you know, reserve it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8723)|
| 2:25:31| some other fund that something else is coming up in the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8731)|
| 2:25:38| And I'll open that up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| Then I have another follow-up question on one of the other designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8740)|
| 2:25:44| I'll come back to you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| You want me to address the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| Let's address the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8749)|
| 2:25:50| The other one is real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| On the county commission discretionary funds, I'm looking at a, we've got three entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8751)|
| 2:25:59| that have to be brought up whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| I think there's a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| I think you only need $37.95, not $47.95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8761)|
| 2:26:06| I'll be glad to provide that information to you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| Since this will be moved forward potentially without recommendation, you could provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| I would defer to Commissioner Hill as we are talking about a volunteer fire, I mean, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8777)|
| 2:26:24| fire department that's in her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8786)|
| 2:26:27| I would like you to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| I do have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| I'll come back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| Mr. Schoonmaker, you've got to know I'm not going to just sit by and let you try and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| that money from Karnes now, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| The history with the Karnes Fire Department, initially it did start out as a volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8801)|
| 2:26:46| service, and the contributions were woefully inadequate to keep this service running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8806)|
| 2:26:57| A decision was made a few years back to go to a subscription service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| What's occurred in our district is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| I know Farragut's felt a little bit of this too, is that we have outpaced our growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| We're growing and adding more houses, so the need of the fire department grew exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8831)|
| 2:27:21| Because it is a volunteer subscription service, though, it is really almost embarrassing how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8841)|
| 2:27:28| many families do not subscribe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| Yet, as a county, we still are required to give fire service, whether you're subscribed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8851)|
| 2:27:38| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| You just either pay before or you get deemed afterwards if you don't have the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8859)|
| 2:27:47| I might also point out, too, that unlike rural metro, that Karnes is not-for-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| and it is a community-based entity that gives back about as much as they take in their service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8873)|
| 2:28:05| to the entire, really, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| I can assure you these funds are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| Most of them are used for capital improvements with more fire trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| They're getting ready to add, hopefully, another fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| It's just a situation where, right now, District 6 is not supporting them through subscriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8902)|
| 2:28:29| the way that should be occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8909)|
| 2:28:33| I'm going to go back to Commissioner Schoonmaker and open this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| I will come back to Commissioner Smith, and I do have a question myself and Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| I'm not picking on District 6 or anything like that because you know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| but I guess what I'm looking at is just the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| Rural metro is a voluntary subscription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8931)|
| 2:28:54| You do not have to pay the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| What happens is, because many county residents do not subscribe to rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| our rates keep going up and up and up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| Yet, we're not receiving any tax dollars from Knox County to offset those costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| but the fire company in your area is, and that's where I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8951)|
| 2:29:16| If it was in Bustler's District, I'd be saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| Is this fair to the taxpayers at whole where you've got a subscription-based service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8959)|
| 2:29:25| As you know, the county is not required to provide fire protection to its citizens, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8965)|
| 2:29:32| But that's actually a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| That's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| I'm just saying from the numbers standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8976)|
| 2:29:39| and could you use that $125,000 somewhere else in your district or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8985)|
| 2:29:46| I appreciate what you're saying, and being a subscriber of Carnes Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8986)|
| 2:29:53| also owning property that I have to subscribe to rural metro also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=8993)|
| 2:30:00| I would really like to know if the rates are comparable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| I mean, I feel like this last couple of years Carnes has had to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| and so that might be for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9011)|
| 2:30:16| But all that said, I believe I understand that there is a mayor's task force that's been appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9016)|
| 2:30:22| that is looking into all of these, and we'll come back with recommendations in the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9022)|
| 2:30:28| Hopefully we'll have a lot of this settled, and it will be closed for discussion by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9028)|
| 2:30:36| I think before I move on to Commissioner Smith, Daly, Ward, and Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| one question I just had that was posed by a constituent in your district was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| why am I having to be double pay or double taxed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| The gentleman said, I am a subscriber to the Carnes Fire Department service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| and I pay for that protection, yet I also pay taxes, which then pays it again to help support the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9055)|
| 2:31:03| And he felt like he was being essentially double taxed for the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| where if you're a rural metro subscriber, your taxes pay nothing for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9067)|
| 2:31:14| but yet you pay your subscription, and that was his comment to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| I want to take it over to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| I see Dwight at the podium, but you have been waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9082)|
| 2:31:25| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| Mr. Chair, I have a brief comment on this, but I'll defer because I actually want to talk about another subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9087)|
| 2:31:32| and I don't think there's a need to change conversation midstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| So I'll defer to, I believe, Commissioner Daly was the next with his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| But he's been one round, Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| It's not spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| We're going ping pong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| You're going to go to Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9106)|
| 2:31:47| I don't think Commissioner Ward spoke yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9110)|
| 2:31:51| Mr. Chair, being the new guy here, do we have a representative from the Carnes Voluntary Fire Department here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| I do not see one, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| I don't know the right wording for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| It would be a good idea to remove this from this current plan, punt it to next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9122)|
| 2:32:08| where they could be adequately informed that we're going to discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9128)|
