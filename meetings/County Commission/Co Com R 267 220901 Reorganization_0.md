| 0:49:01| can add some additional detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Tennessee, electing pursuant to TCA subsection 8-19-101F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2946)|

| 0:49:31| Do we want to go into detail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| We have Director Caldwell and Randy Smith available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2973)|

| 0:49:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| I believe we spoke to each of you individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| But ultimately, state law allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| to be self-insured on bonds now and not issue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| And so all this is doing is taking advantage of state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| and making all of our elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| self-insured in lieu of getting a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| What is the savings that we have from this move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| We estimate about $34,000 each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220901-reorganization?start=3022)|
