| 0:01:06| people who are testifying? Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. If you're here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=66)|
| 0:01:13| to appear and testify before the Knox County Bureau Board, would you please stand, raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| your right hand, and repeat after me. I do solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=78)|
| 0:01:26| you shall give in this matter shall be the truth, the whole truth, and so help me. Nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=86)|
| 0:01:34| but the truth shall help you, God. Thank you. Be seated. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| Madam Clerk, will you read our first item? Discussion and possible action against beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| permittees who have violated Knox County beer laws pertaining to the possession of a controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| substance that is listed in Schedules 1 through 6 of TCA Subsection 39-17-401. Elizabeth Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=111)|
| 0:02:01| Rising Moon Saloon, 10015 Rutledge Pike, Suite 104, On Premises, District 8. Okay. And is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=121)|
| 0:02:10| Ms. Moyers here? Okay. Thank you. And would you all please come forward. Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| will you brief us in what we're about to embark on? Commission, basically we have a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=137)|
| 0:02:29| brought to us by the beer inspector concerning the location of the Rising Moon Saloon on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| Rutledge Pike. What we'll do here is introduce the parties. We'll have the charges presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=155)|
| 0:02:43| to the board, and we will give you time to ask questions and discuss. This is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| unique. We have two coming up that's not exactly selling to minors like you're used to hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| So we'll give you some clarity on what your options are to address the problems at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=178)|
| 0:03:05| Would you please state your name and the address of your business for the board? Yes, Your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Honor. I guess I'm so used to being in the criminal courts. My name is Stan Young, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| I'm the legal representative of the bar in question. I'll let Ms. Moyers state where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| the bar is at and the address. Okay. Elizabeth N. Moyers, Rising Moon Saloon, 10015 Rutledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=205)|
| 0:03:33| Pike, Corrington, Tennessee. Thank you. The procedure today, Mr. Young and Ms. Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| we will let the officer who is bringing the complaint come and testify before this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| as to what the issues and facts in question are. Then we'll give you an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| respond, and the board will then ask you questions and so forth and come up with their finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| and recommendations. So at this time, I'm going to ask the beer inspector, Wolfie May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| to come and bring the issues before this body. I'm Alan Wolfie May, and on March 22, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=248)|
| 0:04:24| the defendant, Ms. Moyers, was found to be in possession of a small amount of marijuana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| She's working, slash, maybe co-owner of the Rising Moon Saloon on Rutledge Pike, and she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| was cited, Mr. Mayer cited, for the simple possession. Ms. Moon and Attorney Young, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=279)|
| 0:04:52| believe you have an opportunity. How do you plead to the charges? Well, I guess I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=292)|
| 0:05:01| to say, at this time, the Knox County Sheriff's Department cited Ms. Moyers for the substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=301)|
| 0:05:13| that they found. That is allegedly Schedule 6, which is marijuana. That case is pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| and is set to have a preliminary hearing on June 12th in the Knox County General Sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| Court, First Sessions, which is also known as Misdemeanor Court. I believe that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| are some constitutional issues as to the search of Ms. Moyers and her personal property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| day. Ms. Moyers was not working in her capacity as a manager or owner that day. It's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| my understanding that there were several other patrons that were searched that day and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| other citations or anything else was cited against the business. That there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| no other citations against this business, at least through official channels. No underserving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| no over-serving, no other citations that I know of, that I've been made aware of. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=363)|
| 0:06:13| Moyers has never been in trouble before. She has never had any encounters with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| before. Again, that day, she was more of a patron than she was an actual employee or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| part owner of the business. I would like an opportunity to address the criminal matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=383)|
| 0:06:32| over in General Sessions Court, honestly, before this beer board would make any type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| of decision toward the business or toward Ms. Moyers. Again, it's been my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| that Knox County Sheriff's Department, doing their duty, have been in the business several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| times and have conducted searches and have found nothing. This has been an isolated incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=409)|
| 0:06:58| at least as far as through the official channels go. I don't know if there have been other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| complaints or neighbors who have made complaints, but I think the way to do that is for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| to do that through official channels so that this beer board is aware of it and so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| any legal representative of the business would also be aware of it and maybe there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| some type of action that I could facilitate in conjunction with the Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| Department to cure any type of concerns that they may have toward the business. Honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=444)|
| 0:07:35| I guess I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage today because I was just hired not too long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| ago to represent Ms. Moyers in her criminal matter, and then I was also notified of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| I guess, concurrent pending matter as well. It is a very important matter, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| that it's not the first time that I've been in front of the beer board for other businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| so I know that your jobs are very important, as is my job of representing Ms. Moyers. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| would like a little bit more time to understand, I guess, the facts of exactly why the search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| was conducted, why the search was conducted the way that it was. Again, I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| there were some constitutional issues. Now, those might not be issues that are a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| for this beer board, or maybe they should be. I don't know. Those are probably better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| addressed over in General Sessions Court. I know that, I guess, the decisions that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| all are making today are probably based off of what the officer has said today occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| that day. Now, the officer didn't get into a whole lot of details. I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| he needs to or not. A citation was issued to Ms. Moyers. Ms. Moyers, she was not arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| that day. She was cited, which means she was essentially written a ticket. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| if that ticket was written against the business. It's my understanding that it was not against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| her personally. Again, she was not working that day at the business, which I feel is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| fairly important. I would like an opportunity to try to at least, if the board has any type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=546)|
| 0:09:15| of concerns toward the business of Ms. Moyers, I would like an opportunity to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| some type of remediation plan or any type of plan that would address any concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| the Knox County Sheriff's Department has, because I respect their concerns, and any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| concerns that the beer board, this beer board, would have toward Ms. Moyers as her capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| as a manager and part owner of the business, and any other concerns that they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| toward Ms. Moyers. Mr. Young, thank you, and hello again. Hello, Mr. Young. Mr. Young and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| I are familiar with each other through, he was a student of mine just a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| ago, wasn't it? Just one or two. Yeah, just one or two, Mr. Norman. And a very good student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| Very good student and a gentleman, and I enjoyed him. Just to push this along a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| possibly in a direction that might be agreeable to Ms. Moyers, I did want the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=611)|
| 0:10:20| first to maybe go through what our options are, given where we are right now in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| and certainly one of the options, I think, is just a letter of admonition about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| situation as an option. I mean, we can, we have some fine options, penalty options as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| well, but given what you've described and what these options are, I think you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| find something that's agreeable to you. But I'd like for the law director first to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| those options. Thank you, Mr. Norman. Mr. Young, we have a basically bifurcated hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=652)|
| 0:11:01| This is a civil matter based upon the beer ordinances alone, and I understand your constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| issues and the criminal thing, which are two separate things. Understood. What's brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| before this body is an allegation and testimony that there has been, quote, illegal activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| occurring under this license property. And the beer board has jurisdiction over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| based upon the facts. The option that the beer board has today is, is they can go, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| the chairman has so well stated, they can go from a letter of, if you will, to let you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| know that you're not happy with what occurred, up to a $1,000 fine, up to suspension of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| you know, 30, 60, 90 or permanent revocation. All of those are the options of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| based upon these findings. One piece of fact, though, I would like to ask Ms. Moyers, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| you the co-owner or the sole permit holder? Co-proprietor. Okay. So this is your establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| and under the rule, if you're in there, you're working. Okay? So I wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| I wanted to know this testimony before this board to help them understand what, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| decisions they're going to make today. And so right now, they currently can, can do everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| from a letter to revocation of your, of your permit. Mr. Chairman. Okay. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=753)|
| 0:12:41| Law Director. Dr. Briggs, go ahead. Yeah, I just had a question for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| because I think there's a difference between someone being accused of a misdemeanor or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| a criminal problem and someone being convicted or admitting guilt to it. And I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| how the, you know, how the law or how do the laws applying to, to beer boards look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| Because that, there is a big difference in my mind on that. Well, Mr. Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| the way, or Dr. Briggs, I should say, the way it works here is, just as any other allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| this is a quasi-judicial hearing. It has the same force as a hearing in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| You basically are the judges. We facilitate it here. We have a sworn officer that's come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| and testified. You can ask him more facts. You can inquire into what you want, just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| any other judicial hearing. They have a right to face their accuser, which is here and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| She's represented by counsel. This is a civil matter, so there's no criminal, no loss of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| liberty or, or property other than the privilege of a license as it could be at stake. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| so whether she, in this case, she is convicted of a crime, the question before this is, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| an unlawful activity happened on the premises, and is this, is this license subject to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| action? So it is separate and apart, and we have different constitutional standards, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=854)|
| 0:14:22| it's, it's up to you all to weigh this evidence and decide. So you can, you can ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=862)|
| 0:14:31| of the sheriff's department. You can ask questions of Ms. Warrior. You can take the testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| that's already been given. And the real question is, is, you know, what do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Let me just ask one question. You may have, you may have answered this earlier. Is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| the first misdemeanor citation of some sort of criminal activity that we've, that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=888)|
| 0:14:58| had? Yes. First citation under this ownership. And again, I guess, Ms. Warriors has never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| been cited for anything before and has never been in trouble with the law before. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=906)|
| 0:15:18| think something to add, since I guess we really have kind of glanced over some of the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| of the facts of this case, and I believe, and obviously the law director knows more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| about this whole process than I do, obviously, but the, the alleged substance that is alleged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| to be Schedule 6 marijuana was, obviously it was a misdemeanor amount, because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| was the citation. It was found in a purse in a, in a bathroom away from the main area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| of the bar. There's been no allegations that there was smoking going on inside of the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| no allegations of, that I've heard of, that there were any drug dealing going on in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| bar, that actually there was not any consent for anyone to search this particular bag that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=962)|
| 0:16:11| allegedly had this substance in it. And to my knowledge, there's been no toxicology report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| that's come back to state exactly how much we're talking about or exactly what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| talking about. Okay, Ms. Burroughs. In the past, when we've been faced with an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| like this where someone had a court date that was pending, the board postponed any action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| on that item until after the court hearing, and I think that that is the reasonable thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| to do in this case as well. So I'm going to make a motion that we postpone this until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| the June meeting, which you said your court date is June 16th? Yes, ma'am, June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| June 12th. So at that point, at our June meeting, that should be wrapped up and we should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| more clarity on exactly what's happened. So that's going to be my motion. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| Okay, we have a second. Mr. McKenzie. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I guess, you know, do we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| to be a bit more vague on that? Because will there be a continuance on June the 12th? Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| that a possibility? You say you've just been hired. So if we set it for June 12th and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| continue, do we want to make the resolution immediately after this is adjudicated? Would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| the maker of the motion consider that as a friendly amendment? So you're saying you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| the motion to state that this will come before the beer board immediately after it's resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| in the courts? I'm fine with that. Larry, are you okay with that? Thank you. And my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| question is, probably for Wolfie, just for my general knowledge, not judging on any parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1062)|
| 0:17:51| of the case at all, how much, what's the volume of marijuana that makes it a misdemeanor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| The maximum volume. Anything less than 14.2 grams. Thank you. Okay, Mr. Brown. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| you, Mr. Chairman. You know, anything that we further question and dig out here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1085)|
| 0:18:19| may jeopardize this young lady's case in court. I don't think a postponement is sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| in this case. We're talking about a scheduled drug. I would make a substitute motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1105)|
| 0:18:39| be suspended until that has been adjudicated. I don't hear a second. So that substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1119)|
| 0:18:54| motion dies for lack of second. Okay, back to the original motion. Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1134)|
| 0:19:03| Mr. Wright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm really at a loss as to where we ought to head on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1143)|
| 0:19:13| this particular situation. This one and the next one also, because these are issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| have never, as I remember, come before the beer board. My staff and I have discussed both of these, and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1158)|
| 0:19:34| ma'am, you should be happy that I'm not the person that made the motion, because my motion would have been to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| revoke your license. I view the sale of beer, not in a moral sense, but in the legal sense, the worst thing that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1180)|
| 0:19:58| happen that we've seen is, and it's despicable, it's something we do not pass on lightly, but we find that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1198)|
| 0:20:10| people because they've sold underage. This is a step above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| And for us to be away from this for a couple of months, maybe it will be enough to temper my judgment on where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1218)|
| 0:20:26| ought to end up with this, especially knowing that you will be exposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| and open to a normal ongoing of business, and you will have your day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1232)|
| 0:20:42| And I'm not a follower of this particular type of charge in the court system, but you've heard what I've had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1242)|
| 0:20:51| I think fellow commissioners have heard what I have had to say. And most importantly, I think that people that have beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| permits in Knox County, and whether we're talking about illegal drugs or the illegal use of prescription drugs, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1257)|
| 0:21:12| whether we're going to be talking in a moment about untaxed alcohol, or whether we talk about gambling machines, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| enough that we're allowed to control and expose the community to beer. I think it's more important that we protect what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1278)|
| 0:21:33| have to sit here and say on this beer board about some of the things that are outside, just talking about the legal sale of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| beer, and the illegal things of other acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| So I'm in support of this deferral until such time as you've completed your circuit through court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| And three or four months from now, maybe the outcome would be different from what my staff had on its mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| Mr. Brown, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| If we just postpone this, this allows her to continue in business and continue to sell beer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| I want you all to consider that before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| Let me reiterate here where we are in terms of what you're dealing with from a legal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| This is a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| This is a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| And under your own code, under your own ordinances, you have up to a $1,000 fine, suspension or revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| Under the nonresponsible vendor first offense, if you choose that option, this says 30-day basically that you have a letter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1360)|
| 0:22:52| admonishment and put it in their record for the court for 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| You have all those options available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| As a side note, generally on a first offense in criminal court under such charges as this, they will receive a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1381)|
| 0:23:10| They may have to go to drug court school and pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| So this is the level of situation that you're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| We're not in a criminal world, but I want you to understand the maximum they can face on the criminal side is generally a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| sometimes probation or both are waived and they go to a school type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1407)|
| 0:23:38| So I'm not taking sides on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| I just want you to understand where we are and what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| Mr. Chairman, acting on what the law director has just stated, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1427)|
| 0:23:56| we've talked about it being after court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Do we need to make sure it's after drug school or those other things until they've made their complete path through whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1441)|
| 0:24:13| I'll use the word remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| You know, that's a good point in that this is just for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| I wasn't the maker of the motion, but that's a good point in that if it is something, that may be a further delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| And I don't know if we can act on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Can we act on something after it's gone through the courts but hasn't been completed during that interim, if there is an interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Well, you can act on something before it goes to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| This is a civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| The criminal matter is separate and apart altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| The options over there are, I forgot the major one, is that she, in fact, can be found not guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| And so it goes away instantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| And under our rules, she stands before you in a criminal matter not guilty right now until they go through due process and find her guilty criminally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1499)|
| 0:25:11| From a civil standpoint, you have a testimony before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| You have a refuting testimony before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| You can defer to hear what the in-depth testimony with all the toxicology reports and et cetera I'm sure that Mr. Young will require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| and see what the due process says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| I mean, there's a lot of things you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| You can defer it as the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| It's up to this body because you're looking at a different standard of preponderance, not beyond a reasonable doubt here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| So it's a lower threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| And the offenses, truthfully, you know, like I say, they range from a letter for 36 months in her file to revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| So it's entirely up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| And, Mr. Chairman, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| I defer to Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| I'm the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Here's my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| All I'm interested in is whether the court says she's guilty or not guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| I'm not interested in what her penalty is or how long it takes her to carry it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| I want guidance from the court as to whether she's found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Right now, she's considered not guilty until she has her day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| I think it's inappropriate for us to act on this until we hear from the court whether she's guilty or not guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| I don't think there's any need to wait until she's completed whatever she might be ordered to do by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| We just need that ruling from the court before we take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1599)|
| 0:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| We have a motion before us to defer until the court proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Ms. Brown had a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Thank you, Ms. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Mr. Young, obviously you can see the range of opinions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| It's a very serious matter, and I'm sure you have felt that seriousness, and we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| We'll see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you very much, Mr. Norman and Mr. Smith and everyone on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| I do appreciate you listening to us and giving us an opportunity to come before all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| And I guess just as we all know in here, the Knox County Sheriff's Department does a fine job at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| They'll continue to monitor this business, so I'm sure that if there are any problems, they will notify the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| And the business is taking this very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Ms. Moyers is taking this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| It's why they hired me, and we want to do nothing but to please the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| and to not have any problems with the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1677)|

| 0:28:59| You'll have an opportunity to respond, refute, and face the accusations and things that are alleged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1739)|
| 0:29:07| The board itself will then weigh the evidence and decide what will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| At this time, I'll call Lieutenant Wolfie May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1753)|
| 0:29:22| On March 15, 2013, the Oshkosh Sheriff's Beer Inspector conducted a walkthrough at J.B. Creekside Bar on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1762)|
| 0:29:35| In the freezer was two quart jars of moonshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| They weren't completely filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| One was probably a third full, and the other one was mixed with fruit punch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| and was probably not quite half full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1790)|
| 0:29:59| Seeing I'm under criminal thing again, I would like this deferred until after the criminal hearing is done, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1799)|
| 0:30:09| I'll make that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| But, you know, Jeff, you sort of saw from the previous one what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| I mean, I understand and completely listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| I mean, but I think we need to go through the criminal process first and then come back here and deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| I should respect that, Mr. Law Director, until he goes through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| What's the best way to put this in the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Well, you could use a similar motion that Commissioner Broyles used that until after adjudication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| and the beer board convening after adjudication can bring this back before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| The penalties and so forth are still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| In this particular instance, both of these issues are what they call unlawful conduct on the premises where the license issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| It doesn't really matter, you know, what the unlawful conduct is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| And it has to be based upon the testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| And so we can have a rehearing of it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| It's at the pleasure of this board how you want to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| So you'll need to make a motion similar to Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I'll make a motion to that effect that you stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1881)|

| 0:31:23| You have your wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Deferred application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Muhammad A. Shaban, Gigi's Market, 7201 Chapman Highway, off premises, formerly Smoky Mountain Gas Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| Was Mr. Shaban here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| He's not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| This is the second month in a row they haven't shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| I went out and posted a notice on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| The building is empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| There was some type of civil warrant hanging on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| They haven't done anything as far as trying to get it open or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| So was it appropriate for us to ask for a revocation at this point or is that too big of a bite?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| There's no testimony to say that there's any cause for revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| You probably could make a motion to withdraw and then he'll have to reapply and go through the normal process to get anything in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1940)|
| 0:32:31| That we withdraw the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| No, there is only the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| The application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=1954)|

| 0:36:34| So, before you can go into business, you must complete the server training program to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| beer to your and sale beer to your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2199)|

| 0:36:50| And everybody there that's going to be selling this beer, they've completed that training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| also, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2211)|

| 0:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I'm going to ask some questions now of some of the departments of Knox County, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2215)|

| 0:38:22| moral turpitude within the past ten years? No sir. Has beer ever been sold at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| before? Is there an outstanding license? Okay, before you can be issued anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| license has to be turned in. It's over here, okay. We'll have to have that. Is this off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2316)|
| 0:38:46| premises? Okay. Is the application for owner off premises? Off premises. Okay. Do you own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| the premises where you're selling? No. You lease it, okay. Do you have any business relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| with the owner of the property? No. Okay. Does anyone else have an interest in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| business other than you? Yes, but like I don't know the name of the person. Oh, you're incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2347)|
| 0:39:20| Who will operate the business? My husband and me. Okay. Are you familiar with the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2360)|

| 0:39:32| in conformity with them? Yes sir. Okay. Have you completed your server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| Yes sir. Has everybody there completed that? Okay. Mr. Chairman. Okay, thank you Mr. Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| Director. I'm sorry, I need to. Oh, you've got reports. I almost overlooked Wolfie and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2384)|

| 0:40:27| on and off premises, formerly Pit Stop John Sevier, District 9. Mr. Chairman, before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| leave, those of you who were just approved, you need to see the young lady in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| here with her hand up. She has a package for you that may keep you from coming back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| under dire circumstances. Okay, thank you, Mr. Brown. Yes, sir. Name and address. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| name is David Flickcroft. I live at 2016 Berrywood Drive, Knoxville. I am a practicing attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| Mr. Naylor can't be here, and he's asked me to come in his stead. And Mrs. Sexton, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| to compliment her. She does a great job. And what happened is we got him on the phone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| we grilled him. Okay. All right. Thank you. We got him to answer the same questions. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2473)|
| 0:41:23| Mr. Law Director, go ahead. So you're representing him on his behalf, and you have gotten the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| answer to the questions from him, so I will be asking you these questions on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| Have any of the employees of this location ever been convicted of any violation of laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| against possession, sale, manufacture, transportation of intoxicating liquors or crimes against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| moral turpitude in the past ten years? Well, he intends to purchase the existing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| and that's set to close on June the 10th, 2013. And he said that he did intend to employ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2517)|
| 0:42:08| many of the existing employees and that none of them have any problems like that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2528)|
| 0:42:16| Point of order, Mr. Law Director. Yes. I know that they're allowed to have an attorney present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| here, but does the individual not have to be present? He has . . . the individual doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| have to be present if he's represented by counsel, and the counsel is representing him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| under oath. But he's swearing to stuff for this guy who . . . this guy's not here. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| understand. But where he is is he has, if you want to say, deposed his testimony. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2561)|
| 0:42:50| you want to have him here, you can defer this. Well, one reason . . . and you can pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| along, Mr. Attorney . . . is that the previous owners were up here twice under bad circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| and one more time their license would have been gone. So if he intends to run this, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| not far from my house, and I know Wolfie checks it regularly, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| So I would admonish him to watch your P's and Q's. Yes, sir. Okay. Is there an outstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2599)|
| 0:43:28| license at this location? Yes, there is. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| It will have to be turned in before the application is completed. Is this for on and off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| It's just off premises, and that's a mistake. Okay. So it is . . . it should only be off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| in the application. Okay. Is he on this premises, or is he leasing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| He'll own it. He'll own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Does anyone else have an interest in the business other than himself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Well, the business is technically going to be titled an LLC, Limited Liability Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| and he and his wife, Veronica, will be the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Okay. And will they be the ones operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Yes, sir. Okay. Is he familiar with the laws of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| and the Tennessee Bureau of Laws and Regulations, and does he agree to conduct the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| in conformity with these laws? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| Okay. Have they completed the server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| No, he's planning to attend the server program in two or three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| Okay. Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| Okay. Bureau Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Mr. Law Director, I need to do an inspection or get with the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| about previously required items under the use on review that was never done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| and there's some illegal signs out there that need to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Okay. Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Okay. Mr. Chairman, you've heard the testimony and the stipulations and issues at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| server training and what the departments have brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lowry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| Too many ifs, ands, or buts in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| I know our next meeting will be past that June 12th date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| but, number one, I don't like him not being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and, number two, I don't like him not having taken the server training course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| because I know that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| But also, it's been about six, eight months ago that we decided and voted here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| that we need to take some of those signs down and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| and that was not complied with, according to Mr. Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| So I want to know, how can you assure me this guy is going to do any better than the last guy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2750)|
| 0:46:01| Well, he's paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Do you swear to that, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| No, I certainly can't swear to anything in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| I move that we approve pending all the issues that's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Any further questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| One passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Discussion regarding amending the Knox County Code to require beer permit holders to have all their servers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| execute a form which would be approved by the commission to acknowledge that there are criminal penalties associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| with the sale of beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| Okay, thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| This was one of my ideas, and, of course, we've got time to discuss this and chew on it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2821)|
| 0:47:11| The ordinance is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Everybody has a copy of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Does everybody have a copy of the ordinance and the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| It's a separate page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| It says at the top, add to section 4-12 of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| And so this is all fine with me except in the actual document down where there's going to be a signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2846)|
| 0:47:40| I just would request and have talked to the law director that I would like some enumeration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| or description of the criminal penalties that are referred to there in the last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2866)|
| 0:47:55| And so if those get spelled out and there's, you know, the purpose of it is that it offers a warning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2875)|
| 0:48:06| a substantial warning as to the consequences of selling an underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| And I'm hopeful that that will be helpful if the individual that's the vendor that's actually operating the register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2891)|
| 0:48:22| realizes the penalties that are possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| So that's my hope for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| Okay, we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| Just one question for our beer inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| When you make a bust on this Wolfie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| do you immediately ask for that employee's file to check to see if something like this might be in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| or anything that might pertain to your citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2936)|
| 0:49:15| One of the problems is if I go on second shift, the manager has them locked up in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| and usually I can't verify anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| As I go around, I try to tell them to put them in a folder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| and stick them somewhere where I would have access no matter what time I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Okay, I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Wolfie, there's a number of issues probably to be addressed in this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| If it was to be enacted, there would be such things as, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| do we send them all out right now to every vendor in the county, some 170 vendors of alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=2989)|
| 0:50:00| So these are things for us to discuss in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Do you see, what are the issues that you see in this, good and bad, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3004)|
| 0:50:11| maybe before we go forward, or things that we should address in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| if this is approved at this stage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Does this look like, first of all, is it helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| I mean, it may be my imagination that this would be helpful, but we continue to get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| we get some repeaters in here about selling underage, and it's just my idea that that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| that has to put their name right there beside those criminal offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| that that might make them think twice or three times, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| I think it would help because a lot of them think they'll just get fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| and just go down the street and get another job and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| That would help having the server's cards available to where we could check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| and make sure that they have attended a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| The biggest thing is the fact that they hired an employee today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| and they may not go to the class for a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| and they don't know the rules, they don't know how to check a driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| they don't know how to do all the things that they need to know before they start selling or serving alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| So that's a procedural issue that we need to address as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| Part of the distribution of these could be done through the classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| But I agree with Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Somehow we're going to have to make a contact to let these vendors know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| that two things need to be available to him when he comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| You know, the records for that employee, maybe it's not their complete personnel file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| which should be confidential, but there should be items such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| and their server training certificate certainly should be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| That's not, you know, it's public knowledge anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| It should be available there when he comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Whatever steps we can take to make sure that happens, I think we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Well, we'll be in discussion with you about things that we might combine in this process to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| That's all we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your leadership on this and make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| We'll continue to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Thanks, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3165)|

| 0:54:30| All are related to the billboard and electronic message center issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3270)|

| 0:54:54| And is Margo Klein here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| I assume that she'll be at five also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| And then I have Jim Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Jim, would you like to just wait until five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Okay, so you guys will do that at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3306)|

| 0:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3310)|

| 0:55:33| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| We don't have anybody here, I don't think, for that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3334)|

| 0:56:14| And, Madam Clerk, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Barbara Monti upon the occasion of her retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| Whereas, Barbara Monti has announced her retirement from the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee Office on Aging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| and whereas Barbara Monti was the first manager of the Mobile Meals Program in Knox County since its beginning in 1971,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3389)|

| 0:56:55| Mobile Meals has grown from providing 20 home-delivered meals to 20 senior Knox Countians in 1971,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| to today serving on an annual basis a total of 236,471 meals to 1,477 seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3423)|
| 0:57:14| who are unable to cook for themselves and have no one to cook for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| and whereas as Director of the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee Office on Aging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| Barbara Monti is also responsible for planning for services for senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| assessing needs of older citizens and developing resources to meet those needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| coordinating services for the elderly to minimize duplication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| providing information about services and programs to older citizens and their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| and connecting them to those services and advocating on behalf of older citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| and whereas the Knox County Commission wishes to thank and commend Barbara Monti| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| for laudably serving our community and especially our senior citizens over the past 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| and whereas it is fitting for local governments to recognize and salute those citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| who have distinguished themselves as public servants and citizens of whom we can all be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3488)|

| 0:58:22| Barbara Monti's leadership and commitment to the senior citizens in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| has greatly benefited and will continue to benefit so many for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Barbara Monti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3511)|

| 0:58:40| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Ms. Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| When I was elected to the Commission back in 2010 or 2008, I'm sorry, I'm losing track of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3530)|
| 0:59:02| I knew that I wanted to do something to help Knox County get prepared for the large number of seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| what they're calling the silver tsunami.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| Over 10,000 Americans every day are turning 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| and soon we are going to have a continual increase in the number of senior citizens in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| and that was one of the things that I really wanted to focus on as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| was helping Knox County be prepared for that increasing number of senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| And I wasn't really sure where to get started or what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| and Barbara took me in hand and taught me everything that I needed to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| and directed me where I needed to go and invited me to meetings and conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| and really gave me an education on senior services in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| And the longer I've known her and the better I've known her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| the more amazed I am at what she's been able to accomplish for senior citizens in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| and what a tremendous legacy she's leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| We could stay here until the sun goes down and not list everything that she's done for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| and for Knox County as a whole, not just Knox County seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| So although I know she tremendously deserves her retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| I'm very sorry to see her go because I'm going to miss her tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| But I do know that she's still available by phone if I need her, which I greatly appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| But, Barbara, I just want you to know how much we all love you and admire you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| and how much we respect you and the work that you've done for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| Do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3641)|
| 1:00:56| I just would like to say how honored I am and how I appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| I mean, listening to it, I got tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| And so you can see why it was time for retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| And I wish for all of you that you would have the good fortune that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3672)|
| 1:01:21| to have an employment that brought me so much satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| and that now I can leave and say, as I told somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| I'm practicing every day saying, that's not my problem anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| So good luck to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| And thank you for all you do, Amy, for all you do, for not just the seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| but for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| And I am grateful for folks like you that are willing to take on these kinds of responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Thank you, Ms. Monti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Indeed, someone who's worked as long as you have at this job, it's a labor of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| And we greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| We greatly appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| And people around this county are aware of you and what you do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Barbara and I have known each other for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| and we've had many discussions about the needs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| And as I was reflecting back on all of that, before I even got on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| as I was doing my media work and we were talking about mobile meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| and all of the needs that were there on my commission work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| I don't recall ever having told her no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| And so it's like when the Barbaras would come and see you, it was like, okay, get ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| because, you know, they're so convincing that you can't say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| My sense is we haven't seen the last of Barbara Monti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| I think once you go and you travel and you do some things, you'll come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| because knowing you and the love that you have for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I believe we're going to see you get involved again, or at least I hope that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| And congratulations on your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| And I hope you remember that you can't say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| We've got one more, Ms. Monti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| Barbara, thank you for everything you've done for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| From the first time I met you, you've always been first class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| and I just have always respected you and I looked up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| If there's anything I can ever do for you, just let me know and you'll be hard to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| But you always do everything first class and with such dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| You're a great public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Are we ready over there for the next little thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| Some of you that are here, we'll just continue with our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| And last week, we had an interim this month because of some of us attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| We thought it was all due to us attending a pension board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| But in actuality, what I found was there were a lot of us that are very interested in Earth Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| And some of us have shown during that Earth Day their affinity for those days back in the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3846)|
| 1:04:18| And so we created a little something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3858)|
| 1:05:05| This is a true nature's child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| We were born to be wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| We can climb so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| I never want to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| Born to be wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| This is from Disney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Born to be wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3926)|
| 1:05:36| Commissioner Wright wants to know how the royalties on this are going to be split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| And, Danello, it's copywritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| I'm just real glad they didn't play the Agent Aquarius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Sometimes I think you may be trying to hurt me in my upcoming election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| Yes, we might hold this over your head a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Well, anyway, thanks to unknown persons who helped in the production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| I thought that was fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Well, let's go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| If it's okay with the board, we'll go ahead into the regular part of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| So we've got a call roll again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=3976)|

| 1:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| We have ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Mr. Brown is going to be in charge of our devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| If you all would stand with me, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| and I'd like you to observe a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| in remembrance of those that were killed and maimed in the Boston bombings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| at the marathon race there, and then I'll finish up with prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4018)|
| 1:07:12| Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day and for all your many blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| We'd ask that you be with us today as we meet here at the Carolina business of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| that we look at each item and give us the wisdom and knowledge that we need to make the best decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| Lord, we ask you to be with those who were, the families also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| those who were hurt, maimed, and killed in the bombings at the Boston marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| We don't know, Lord, the inner workings of some people's minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| but we'd ask that you be with these families and give them comfort and ease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| We'd ask also, Lord, that you be with our men and women who are serving us in the armed forces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| ask for their safety and for the safety of their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| We thank you for their service, Lord, and those of our emergency personnel here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| and those that took care of them there in Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| We know that our emergency personnel are very vital to our own safety in all of our neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4088)|
| 1:08:15| and we'd ask that you bless them and keep them safe as you go with us again now through this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| and forgive us of our sins, these things we ask in Christ's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Mr. Wright, will you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| I ask that you give proper courtesy to our country's flag and join in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4107)|
| 1:08:34| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4119)|

| 1:08:57| Could I hear approval of minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4137)|

| 1:09:23| and we'll bring back a new one possibly as early as next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4166)|

| 1:09:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Let's see, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Mr. Caldwell, you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Not an amendment, but I passed out a handout in reference to Resolution 806| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| that Dr. Briggs had a concern about at the last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| And I know that's own consent, but I just want to make sure that you all are aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| and that may explain our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=4211)|

| 1:29:25| Otherwise, the motion is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Mr. Dixon, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Mr. Director, I'm a little bit . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| You know, where the real narrowness comes is that the ethics committee's basic purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| was to look at what they call conflicts of interests, which are really financial conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| of interest, either within themselves, directors, or employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| And so the scope is financial conflicts of interest, really, just to narrow it even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| But it has to do with Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| So if any conflict comes up that an employee has a financial interest in something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| like they're putting out for purchase or that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| then they would be they would have a conflict of interest that would have to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| I am looking at what is called employee ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| As we received some training a month or so ago, also makes notice then to nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5418)|
| 1:30:27| The only thing I'm getting at is this is a mixing and matching of what we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5427)|
| 1:30:38| county commission have been directed to set up as an ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| versus what the administration may have as an ethics policy versus what the sheriff's office may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| as an ethics policy or anyone else that's in the county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5451)|
| 1:31:01| Does this then one seated ethics committee handle all of those complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| Because some of these look like they're outside of what we established as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| or what you're talking about right now as an ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| You know, I think that's really something that maybe the law director would have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| But there are gray areas that, you know, we have the employee handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| and that's part of the ethics section of the employee handbook that you're referring to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| And there obviously can still be, you know, areas of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| You know, how about, you know, where is there a conflict at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| And those, I think, could be referred to the ethics committee if there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| Some of this stuff is pretty clear if you're an employee, what you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| It's not really addressed here exactly in the handbook, and I would like the ethics committee to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| Or there may be a complaint filed by an employee, either with the ethics committee or even with human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| because all of that comes, that booklet that you're talking about comes out of human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| And this could be something that I think that the ethics committee looks at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| Because if you look at some of the cases that have been referred to the ethics committee already under the old one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| now some of it did deal with elected people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| but we looked to see if there was insider information on land that was sold out at Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| Now, personally, I don't think we had any business doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| I don't think we had the investigative capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| We had another one where an employee felt that somebody else was trying to get him fired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| and we spent three or four days or a week looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| And those did not deal with necessarily with the people named in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| Many of them were not elected people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| It was a supervisor, and they weren't even in the same department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| So you see the concern I have is that we have been mandated by the state to establish an ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| for which we're trying to establish guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| And then anyone that wants to come along, whether it be another employee or the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| are they going to use, quote-unquote, our ethics committee to go on their hunts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5597)|
| 1:33:27| And I'm asking that as a question to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Well, I mean, I think if you limit it to conflicts of interest and gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| For instance, we find out that somebody that the county does a lot of business with, that somebody gave this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5616)|
| 1:33:46| I'll give you a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Let's say someone in the schools hires someone's son-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| and they also take this person on very expensive trips on places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| and then that person is the one that decides what type of security system goes into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| Is that a conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| And what I mean, I mean, in that, you know, that may or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| I mean, I think a lot of us feel that it is, but there can be more subtle, you know, subtle issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| You know, somebody goes on a trip, but they pay their own way with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I mean, there's things that can come up that could be challenged that aren't covered exactly by the employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| And I appreciate your example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| It exactly addresses what my concern is, that something happens that is unethical in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| Are they going to come and use the ethics committee established by commission to look at gifts and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5675)|
| 1:34:43| as opposed to staying within the Board of Education and using their ethics policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Now, what I gave you was a good example, and it wasn't a good example because the school system has their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| But we could have the same thing happen outside the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| So that would be an issue for the school's ethics committee to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| But we could have exactly the same thing that would happen here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| So what you're saying is that the school system would not come to this ethics committee that we're just now establishing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| I think they've established their own is what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| Now, see, before we had members of the school board and the school system on the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| and I think when Commissioner Hammond was on there, we had some representatives from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| and they would come to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| But in the meantime, they've established their own, so the school would not come here any longer because they have their own ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| So then I go back to the administration's ethics policy, looking at page 12 of what we received training on a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5735)|
| 1:35:44| It states the value of a gift at $20 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| Maybe I was laboring under a misconception it was $35 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5749)|
| 1:35:59| I'll let the law director answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| You know, what the legal situation would be between the employee handbook, human resources, and the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5761)|
| 1:36:10| because this is something that was established by the state, and it's really a legal entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| There are two things that are going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Number one is that the state required the Knox County Commission to come up with an ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| The ethics committee is optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| It's not something that is mandated that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| We as a commission, this group, chose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| Then each individual department establishes their employee handbook, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| That becomes policy for that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| If they came before an ethics committee under that handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| then those handbooks would be the legal standard by which the ethics committee would have to judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| If they don't, say county commission would be coming under their own policies and rules that the ethics committee would have to judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5815)|
| 1:37:04| So the $20 set by the mayor and the administration versus a $35 max cap for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5824)|
| 1:37:14| it would depend who the candidate was, what the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| It would all be fact-driven, and that board would have to look at the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| and the facts under which those individuals would be subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| So you all could even have tighter restraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| You know, you've tightened down some of your sunshine issues that are much tighter than state statute or even Fancler's ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| but those are the ones you would be under because that's what you voted under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| That's just an example of how you can be more stringent than the law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| But whatever it is, your employees would be subject to whatever that policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5864)|
| 1:37:51| So, Mr. Chairman, I guess I'm back to my original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| That means that this ethics committee is not bound to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5874)|
| 1:38:02| It's by whoever's rules they happen to take up for the day, and I'm not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5882)|
| 1:38:10| If the ethics committee is going to support us on what we have as our focus of what needs to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5890)|
| 1:38:20| based on whatever the state mandate was, then I think that the committee that works for us needs to work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5900)|
| 1:38:31| If we're going to have one that enforces or if we're going to have different rules out of the employee handbook for other employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5911)|
| 1:38:39| I would think that maybe the executive branch would need an ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| or a policy by which they administered ethics just as the sheriff will have or the school board, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5924)|
| 1:38:54| board of education will have a means by which they judge their ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| And everyone will not have free access or reign to their different rules using this one ethics committee that we, as commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5940)|
| 1:39:10| establish for whatever we've been directed to do by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| Just to repeat one thing that the law director said is we do not have to have an ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| We have to have an ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| And if we want to just have an ethics policy, I think people wanted to have a committee just to cover gray areas that could come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5964)|
| 1:39:33| so someone would have the opportunity to make an appeal to those to get an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5973)|
| 1:39:42| So going from that, if we commission think we see someone with an ethics violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5982)|
| 1:39:54| then we convene ourselves as our own ethics committee then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| I'm somehow missing something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Could I interject one thing just to further this or quicken it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| This resolution really has to do with primarily the composition of the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| with the friendly amendment addressing elections or people running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| Would your concerns, Mr. Wright, not be addressed once this committee is formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| Could they not address these types of policy considerations in the scope of those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6027)|
| 1:40:34| I think the policy and scope of these things are our purview, not that committee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6034)|
| 1:40:42| Just as the state of Tennessee did not give us any leeway in establishing it, we have to establish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6042)|
| 1:40:49| But I don't think we need to give away what they do as a part of establishing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| We then get back into what Dr. Briggs is trying to help us get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| See, what I think part of it is and what we're looking at here is that now you've got the fox's guard in the hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| In other words, we could set any sort of ethics we want to, whether it's ethics or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| And really what I've really argued for all along is that let's have a citizens committee, a citizens ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| be the one that says this is proper or not proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| It gets appealed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Things get reviewed by people who do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| I tell you, if we're voting on something, on a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| every single one of us would have to recuse herself, and then you have nobody voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| And that's what we ran into before on some of the issues that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| And I think that, in general, the citizens would feel more comfortable by having an independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| and it's what it really is, it's an independent entity to adjudicate ethics issues that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| concerning elected officials and people that work in the county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| And, you know, I'm not going to argue for or against it because we certainly would be meeting the legal requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| just by having an ethics policy, but somewhere someone has to decide what's right and what's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| And I think it's better for an independent group of citizens to be judging than we judging ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| And that's what I mean by the fox guarding the hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| I think that the county and the citizens would feel more comfortable than us doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| us setting our own rules and judging ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| You and I are in complete agreement about we commission shouldn't be setting as the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6152)|
| 1:42:41| But what I'm having trouble with is how does the ethics committee know what should be appropriately before it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6161)|
| 1:42:50| And how would it avoid the issues that you've just named that were maybe inappropriately before it existed in its former self?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6170)|
| 1:43:02| Well, you know, what I would see is that even if there was something that was covered under the employee handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| but a gray area, or if there was something that came up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| I mean, this just came up recently where on the pension board we had some members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| I did this just for full disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| I did the same thing two years ago is that there's a conference out in San Diego that I went two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| and we had some of our members with this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| And I just incidentally, I encouraged the members of the pension board to go to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| But there could be a question about whether that was a conflict of interest or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| And if someone had a question, should members of the pension board be going to meetings that deal with pensions that are paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6216)|
| 1:43:45| you know, we didn't have to pay to go to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| The county, I think, paid our travel expenses, but they didn't charge us a fee to go to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| Was that proper or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| And, see, that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| And there's other issues that come up like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| If someone wanted to challenge it, who's going to adjudicate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| And I think citizens of the county would feel more comfortable with citizens deciding whether something is proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| rather than the people who are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| My question is, does the circumstance or situation or example that you just described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6256)|
| 1:44:24| does that fall under what the state has mandated we set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| I think it does because, see, that would be a gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| That would be a gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| Someone could say that's a gift that someone that does business with the county gave us by not charging us a fee to go to that seminar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6273)|
| 1:44:42| And is it really a gift or is this education or is this to the benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| Would this influence our decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Or is this a conflict because we do business with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| And that's something that could be decided by an ethics committee if someone challenged it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6294)|
| 1:45:03| And, see, that's where I see the role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| And there can be other examples where someone's cousin or someone is trying to get a contract with the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6305)|
| 1:45:15| and they have someone who works in the health department as a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| And someone might say, well, you know, this is a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| That could come before the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| I mean, I think it probably wouldn't if someone's not on the board to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| But someone may claim that there's some sort of favoritism given because they've got a relative who's an employee of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| And I think that's something that, depending on the situation, that an ethics committee could look with and see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| is this really a conflict or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6339)|
| 1:45:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| Any other debate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| It's an unending issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| We have a motion before us with the friendly amendment regarding people running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| Is everybody clear on the motion, structure of the ethics committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| Oh, it's unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Page 17, Resolution 903 is respectfully requesting the Knox County Legislative Delegation to take all necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6387)|
| 1:46:35| and appropriate steps to secure legislation to enable the enactment by referendum of term limits for Knox County Board of Education members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6395)|
| 1:46:47| We have a motion to approve and a second discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6407)|
| 1:46:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Ms. Royles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| Yes, if this were coming before us, maybe in the fall before the legislature meets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| or if the legislator had actually asked us our opinion on this, I would vote in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| because I am in favor of term limits for everyone, for Congress members, for state legislators, for school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| for commission, for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| The problem I have is that it seems to me lately there's been a great deal of what I would term piling on the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| in terms of resolutions that have come before us recently and in attitudes of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| and our inability to seem to work out a schedule for a joint retreat that we had all agreed to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6452)|
| 1:47:43| We also have this joint education committee set up, which I think things regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6463)|
| 1:47:51| and our relationship with the school board are supposed to go for, are supposed to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| So if we're not going to do that, why are we having the education committee to start with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| So just in light of that, although I'm in favor of term limits, I think that this is really the wrong time to be bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6482)|
| 1:48:11| And in light of some attitudes and actions I've seen lately, I'm going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| But if it comes up again in the fall before the legislature actually meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| or if they come to us and ask us our opinion, I'll be happy to vote in favor of it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| I also have a problem with the fact that Sam and I will bring something before this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| asking the legislature to take it under advisement or take action on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| and what we get from the remainder of the commissioners is that's their business, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| We don't need to be telling them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| But in the last few months, we've had several resolutions come forward from other commissioners wanting to do exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| So just on the basis of hypocrisy, I'm going to vote against it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| I'm going to vote for this because I believe very strongly in term limits too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| And I do like what you put in here about when we send this to the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| about dealing just with the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| And the reason is, is that some of these smaller school boards in rural counties have a hard time finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| qualified people to be on their school board and, you know, they may not want to have term limits for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| There probably are some good reasons for it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| The objection that I do have for it, in spite of the fact that I'm going to vote for it, is a lot about what Amy says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6568)|
| 1:49:38| Generally, I don't like these resolutions where we're telling another body, you know, what to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6578)|
| 1:49:47| And I know that you said that there were a lot of citizens that came to you and said that they would like to see this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| And I've had people say to me they'd like to have term limits also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| So who they really need to be addressing, they have elected representatives in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| And I think who they need to be addressing rather than coming to us for us to tell them, they need to be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| They need to be going directly to the people that can effectuate this, which are their elected representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6609)|
| 1:50:17| And that's the only issue I have with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| And it's the same thing about some of the things that have been brought up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| is if they want to do it, let them go directly to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| They don't need to be, you know, I don't think they need to be coming through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6627)|
| 1:50:35| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| This one is a little difficult for me, I guess, because as a member of this education committee at our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| we were talking about the discussion between the county commission and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| And I think we both bodies agreed, those of us who were on that committee, that our relationship is deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| Why that is, not any one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| but I think we both agreed that any goodwill that we had secured several months ago seems to be falling by the wayside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6658)|
| 1:51:06| And we're getting back into this tension between our two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| And so one of the things we hope to do with this education committee is to identify ways that we can better communicate with one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| and to identify ways that we can sit down and talk and to discuss some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| So that's going to be an ongoing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| I, too, am in favor of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| As a term limited individual who will leave this seat August 31, 2014, but who's counting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| I understand fully term limits and am supportive of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| And I know that someone else will take this seat and do a better job than I have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| And I look forward to seeing the work progress and to see the individuals that our citizens choose to put in these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6703)|
| 1:51:49| So I have no issue at all with term limits for really anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| And I agree with Commissioner Burwell on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| What I would like to do, though, is make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| And the substitute motion is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| that we respectfully request the head of the Knox County Legislative Delegation to report to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6724)|
| 1:52:11| the appropriate and necessary steps to secure legislation to enable the enactment by referendum of term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| for the Knox County Board of Education members and to report this to us within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| The reason I say this is because I would like to know exactly what is entailed in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6743)|
| 1:52:29| I would like for Mr. Haynes to report to us and say, okay, because they're not going to bring this up until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6749)|
| 1:52:36| So, you know, we can do it now, but, I mean, we're talking about months before they even bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| I'd like to have a discussion with him and invite the school board to be present when he does this report to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| to say this is what it's going to take, this is what you're going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| And I would also like to ask him to get an Attorney General's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| because those of us who were here during the infamous Black Wednesday and the aftermath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| know that one of the things that came out of that was the fact that the judiciary and the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| were not under the vote that was taken back when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| So I know that there are differences of opinion in terms of the vote and the legality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| I would like for the head of the legislative delegation to report to us and say, this is the process, it's clean, it's legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6792)|
| 1:53:19| we can do this, they can vote, and here's the wording of what that vote would need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| If I can get that, I will support this, vote in favor of it, and send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| But right now, to ask them to take all necessary and appropriate steps, I don't know what those necessary and appropriate steps are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| And I would just like to find out what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| So I'm going to ask that we do a substitute motion that we ask Mr. Haynes to research this, bring it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| and let us know what those steps are to present it to the legislature in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| And I'll make that in the form of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Mr. Brown, would you like to speak now or would you like to wait until the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| Well, a lot of bickering going on back and forth here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| Some people feel trampled on, and I don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6849)|
| 1:54:16| Everybody gets an even chance when they bring something up up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| I've talked to and other people have talked to state legislatures, and they say, fine, let's go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6860)|
| 1:54:28| Senator Massey said that this has been done in other, you know, instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| So what's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| We give them six months to work on it and bring the proper thing through when the legislature takes up session again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6875)|
| 1:54:43| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| You know, it's potatoes, patatas if you vote for it in April or you vote for it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| If you're going to vote for it, it's just as good in April as it is in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| So why wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| Why not get on the bandwagon, let's get this thing moving to where we can do it in a proper manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| when it comes time for them to start the legislative session again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| I don't know why that the school board should feel slighted over something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6909)|
| 1:55:17| What's, you know, what's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| Why should they be any different than any other elected official in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| Everybody else, every other elected official is term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| Why should not the school board be term limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| Because it was set up under a special order by the state legislature, and that happened to fall underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6931)|
| 1:55:40| I see this as housekeeping for Knox County, that everybody's on the level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| It helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Commissioner Hammond just said a minute ago, in 2014 there will be somebody else sitting in his seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| as well as two or three others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| And you've got fresh ideas and new people coming aboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| I think that's what they need on the school board right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| And I'm not saying that as anti-school board, as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| I'm saying it as a taxpayer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| I think that we need to make some changes, and I think that's one place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| And I'm ready to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| I just, you know, I'm in support of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| I'm not in favor of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| But I'd just like to just give a history lesson, you know, kind of throw it through a few facts out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6988)|
| 1:56:35| to have folks think about and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| You know, the whole notion of term limits and whether they should or should not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=6999)|
| 1:56:47| conservatives did not want term limits, okay, historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| That is not a conservative principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| Term limits are, I remember hearing it on talk shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| and it was the talking point amongst the conservatives of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| If you want term limits, you've got to vote them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| That was the standing order of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| So even so much that when the citizens said, no, we want term limits, this body, not these members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| but this body said, ah, don't apply to us, that's other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| And this solidly conservative body continued on until that, you know, infamous day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7038)|
| 1:57:25| And so, you know, when I say, and I'm saying all that to say, I'm not coming conservative, moderate, liberal, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7045)|
| 1:57:36| What I'm saying is we've already had this question answered for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| They took it to the highest level that it could be taken to, and that was the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7063)|
| 1:57:53| Okay, well, maybe it doesn't apply to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| Maybe we can slide it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| They said, school board, that does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| And then I go back and I'll say, well, let's do another history lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| Let's see how long folks hung out on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| You know, commission, conservative folks were sitting on here 30 years, 35 years, 30 whatever years, these long-time folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7089)|
| 1:58:20| And you look at the present makeup of school board, which doesn't have term limits, I don't think there's anyone past the three terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7100)|
| 1:58:26| So, you know, I think even more than they can be voted out, I think with the school board, I think it's a job that's going to have a natural turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7106)|
| 1:58:38| You know, it's an emotional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| You deal with parents that either want to get into your school or don't want to be in your school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| and they deal with issues that kind of tug at them fairly harshly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| But for us to just put out a random, and I do think this is just the original motion, just a random resolution asking, help us find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7132)|
| 1:59:04| I don't think that's responsible without any dialogue, without zero dialogue with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| That's saying, you know, state, we just want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Help us to find a way to get these folks out of office after two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| Whether I'm for it or against it is really pointless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| And, you know, for term limits, I'm not for us imposing our will on another body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| Or even if I am, once that's done, I don't want to continue to revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| You know, we've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| Term limits apply to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| It doesn't apply to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| That was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| That message was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| Now here we are asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| But I am for having Representative Haynes and his staff or whatever staff in Nashville to research it, give us an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7184)|
| 1:59:53| Let's vet that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| But this isn't an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| This is just throwing something out there and say, what's going to stick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| And so that's the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| So I'm in favor of the substitute, but I'm definitely not in favor of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| Mr. Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| I guess I would have been in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| I'm in favor of both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| I would have been in favor of the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| But I'd like the clarification because I'm not totally sure if this is, right now is the appropriate time when the legislature ended, what, a week or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7219)|
| 2:00:28| Nevertheless, I appreciate what Commissioner Hammond added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| And I don't want to be redundant, but if term limits, if they go on the ballot, they'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| It's about a 95% ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| It's like higher taxes, lower taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| Lower taxes are going to pass regardless of the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| We've seen it happen locally and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| And I, like someone said, maybe Commissioner Rawls, I think they should apply in Washington to not just the President| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| but our other friends up there as well as Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| And I'd put the judges in there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| And I know we're not discussing that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| And I have many friends that are judges, as I do on the school board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| The ones, I guess, Doug's the only guy that's been there just a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| And I saw the ones that have been there several terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| They're all good friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| I think they do an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| But I don't see what differentiates those seats and those positions from that of the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| and the county commission and the mayors and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| I know they have no taxing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| Someone gave me that reason, rationale once where they can't raise taxes, so they're exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| Nevertheless, I think they're exempt now because of a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| And I know it is the law as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| Nevertheless, I'm glad we've moved this issue to the front burner here, and I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| I plan on voting for it and see what happens moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| I resent the fact that this is throwing something out just to have something out there and it being random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| And getting back to it, I see it as housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| And I see it as housekeeping of what the people of Knox County want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| Right here 85% of them said it's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| We're up here to support the majority of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7337)|
| 2:02:22| They say they want term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| So why wait until November when you can do something in April to get them started on it down the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| Going back, and I hate to rehash all of this because Mr. Norman, Mr. Smith, and I live through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| and it's not an easy thing to relive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Nonetheless, sometimes it's helpful, I think, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| The citizens voted for term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| The Attorney General said that term limits did not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7372)|
| 2:02:56| Lawsuits were filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| The state Supreme Court ruled that the citizens were paramount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| If they wanted term limits under this rule of government, they could have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| But the state Supreme Court said you cannot term limit the school board and you cannot term limit the judiciary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7386)|
| 2:03:14| So our court clerks, for example, are not term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| So hence my caution is I'm in favor of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| I will vote in favor of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| I think the citizens want term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| To me, that's not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| The issue is let's know exactly what we're asking the legislature and the citizens to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7410)|
| 2:03:37| For example, the reference was made that Senator Massey says this has been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| Where in the state of Tennessee do they have a school board that is term limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| I don't think there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| And so we're taking, if we're going to pursue this, then let's, this could be groundbreaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7430)|
| 2:03:57| and let's find out exactly what we're talking about, exactly what the legislature can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| And I think we're going to have to revisit this state Supreme Court ruling because the ruling was very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| And I remember the discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| I remember the legal minds that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| And I remember the opportunities that we had to perhaps appeal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| We chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| And so as a result, the Supreme Court said this was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Now, maybe there was some wording in the original thing that the people voted on that wasn't correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7462)|
| 2:04:29| I don't know all the nuances of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| I'd like to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| But I think that as we embark on this journey, and we're not looking at November, we're looking at June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| because my substitute motion is saying let's ask Representative Haynes, perhaps Senator Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| whoever he wants to get involved in it, come to us, research this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| In my mind, I want to be clear that we can do it, and here's how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| Because it hadn't been done before in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| No one else, no other school board is term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| There aren't that many county commissions, quite frankly, that are term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| So my feeling is, OK, let's pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| Let's go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| And I appreciate Commissioner Brown bringing it up because I think it's well worth the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| So let's have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| Let's bring in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| Let them do their due diligence with the Attorney General's Office or whatever they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| They've got lawyers there that can do that kind of thing in conjunction with our legal team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| And in June, let's sit down and have a robust discussion about what it's going to take and where we need to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7522)|
| 2:05:29| And then that way, we can then vote in June if we need to and say, all right, here's what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| and these are the steps we would like for you to take, and let's be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| To me right now, this is a bit vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Let's be specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| Let's find out exactly the process that we're going to ask our citizens to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| I'll vote for term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| I'm not afraid to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| What I am concerned about is I want to make sure that we all fully understand the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| that we have done our due diligence so that when we ask the legislature to put it before the General Assembly in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7555)|
| 2:06:03| we've all done our due diligence and we've all had an opportunity to fully vet this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| Mike, I appreciate the comments that you made there and Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| I'm ready to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| The only thing that scares me about this is if we pass it down to Nashville, that's going to put light on that body too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7578)|
| 2:06:25| They're going to say, well, wait a minute, we're not term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| I'm wondering how hard are they going to push the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| So that's why I'm prepared to vote for it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| Seeing no other lights, I just have one or two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| First of all, thank you, Mr. Brown, for bringing this before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| I, too, would vote for this if the substitute motion hadn't come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| I think the substitute motion also does give us a chance to, as Ms. Broad said, address this with the body, with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7608)|
| 2:06:58| The board would be there and be involved in the discussion possibly if this was a presentation by Mr. Haynes or by our representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7618)|
| 2:07:06| And that would give us some opportunity with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| A couple of the things that have come up in the discussion that are a little bit disturbing to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| one is this notion that we have a bad relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| I think we have a different, I would characterize it more as a different point of view that's just based on how we see things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7641)|
| 2:07:28| and what our responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| I don't think we have a, I don't see animosity or some kind of ill will or bad feelings towards the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7650)|
| 2:07:38| I think that's a mischaracterization of what we actually have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| So, again, I thank Mr. Brown for this, but I am going to support the sub motion just based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7662)|
| 2:07:48| I think it would be good for us all the way around in the discussion aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| So the sub motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| I'm going to hazard a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Nose, raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| We have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7693)|
| 2:08:23| 2-773, motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7703)|
| 2:08:32| We're now on page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| Ordinance O-13-3-101 is amending Chapter 2, Article 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7716)|

| 2:09:10| Ordinance O-13-3-102 is to amend Knox County Code, Chapter 26, Article 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7750)|
| 2:09:18| entitled Stormwater Management in order to authorize the Director of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| to establish reasonable fees in Section 2-6-153.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| This amends Ordinance O-07-12-101 adopted January 28, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7767)|
| 2:09:34| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| Is there a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Do we need to read that? Do we need to read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| Do we need to read that into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7785)|
| 2:09:58| The amendment is stated as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| The Director shall have authority to establish reasonable fees for permits issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| and services provided by the County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| under the Knox County Stormwater Management Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| The fee for construction general permits shall be at least 80% of the amount charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation for construction general permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| on May 15, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| The Director may increase the fee for a construction general permit from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| Any increase in the construction general permit fee charged by the Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| shall be effective 30 days after notice of the increase served on the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Just to remind the group that this change is brought about by our excellent Stormwater Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7843)|
| 2:10:51| They have earned the respect of the State to the point that instead of the State having to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| they can do these inspections locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| So we're doing part of the State's work here, and that's why the adjustment in some of the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7866)|

| 2:11:46| If those items, the people that I had signed up were related to the billboard issue and EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7906)|
| 2:11:55| And anybody else like to speak right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7915)|

| 2:12:37| First item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| The first item is on page 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| It's item 2-E-13-RZ, request of David C. Campbell for rezoning from A Agricultural to PR Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| The property is located south side of Shackleford Lane, east of Graves Road in the 8th Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7969)|
| 2:12:55| District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| Would you ask if the applicant is here, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| We don't have any applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| We have the applicant here and we have a thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| You're Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7991)|
| 2:13:12| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| And please stand up all of the folks here that are in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=7994)|
| 2:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Thank you all for coming this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| Mr. Wright, would you like to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| There has been a lot of conversation over this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| It's Shackleford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| Applicant making a request for a planned residential of three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8016)|
| 2:13:45| Metropolitan Planning Commission on a very thin vote, I think 8-7, approved a density of two in planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8025)|
| 2:14:00| And the community has come forward with some rather pressing concerns that nothing really has happened in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8040)|
| 2:14:09| to warrant a planning change, an overlay change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8049)|
| 2:14:20| I had made, and it's sort of uncustomary that I would do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| but I'd made a commitment that I believe that the rest of the community looked like one residence to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8064)|
| 2:14:34| or even greater acreage as in five and seven acres to the residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8074)|
| 2:14:42| So I believe in keeping with the other residences that are located in this area that the density should be one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8082)|
| 2:14:51| Now the thought, the plot thickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| We went through a rather lengthy slope and ridge discussion here, commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8097)|
| 2:15:07| and I guess the reason that I never picked up on associating planned density on this particular site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8107)|
| 2:15:16| with the slope and ridge arrangements that we have, which I'll go a little bit further and say is the clustering of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8116)|
| 2:15:28| in certain areas of the residence, of the acreage, and still staying within a certain density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8128)|
| 2:15:39| And as I'm expressing here, a density of one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8139)|
| 2:15:46| I guess I would like to see if I could call upon anyone that is in opposition to the development first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8146)|
| 2:15:53| to say if they have a concern with which direction, because this is something that's just coming up this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8153)|
| 2:16:01| Does anyone in opposition to the two to an acre want to speak to anything about the one to the acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8161)|
| 2:16:10| And if not, then I think that, okay, if you will come down to the front and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8170)|
| 2:16:29| I guess a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| We have something on before us, and now we're discussing something that's not before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| How do we go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| Maybe I'll look to the law department for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| It looks like we have before us two to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| I don't know if we have anything before us, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| We have before us what MPC has put before us, and we're now discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| We're not discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| It sounds like we're discussing one to the acre, and there's nothing on the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| There's no motion before us, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| And then, secondly, it sounds like if there is a motion, it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Mr. Wright, would you like to make a motion to get it before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8228)|
| 2:17:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| We're going to have to discuss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| I don't know what we would discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| What we're going to discuss is what is before us from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8238)|
| 2:17:24| If nobody makes this motion, then it dies for lack of a motion, and we don't discuss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8244)|
| 2:17:30| So if nobody wants to make this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| Procedurally, we do need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| Then, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| You may be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| The motion that will be before us is that this request to rezone from agricultural to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| commenced with the developer at three to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| Metropolitan Planning Commission has brought to us a planned residential at a density of two to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8274)|
| 2:18:01| and I move that the development be approved at a planned residential one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| So our motion is planned residential, one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8293)|
| 2:18:19| That's the motion, and it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| You still have the floor if you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| Would you like to go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| We really need to let the applicant speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Mr. Campbell, will you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8319)|
| 2:18:50| Hello, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| My name is David Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| My address is 325 Wooded Lane, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8332)|
| 2:19:01| Would you like to start to support your contention for two per acre, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| My client is interested in optimizing his options for this property that they've owned for some years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8348)|
| 2:19:16| and they made this request zoning at three units to the acre, and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| it was approved finally at two units to the acre at the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| As far as we support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| he would like to have the option of being able to develop the property at up to two units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| approximately 104 structure residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| He's talked about a variety of different development schemes, many of which are the small acre, multi-acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8376)|
| 2:19:42| small mini-farm type of tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| I met with some of the residents there at Shackleford Lane because I wanted to see firsthand exactly the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8395)|
| 2:20:02| and also hear some of their concerns and also take a look at the information that had been provided to us by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8402)|
| 2:20:09| I guess my first point is that in driving out there, beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| I mean, it's out there near the lake, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| I guess my second point would be that a number of people have moved there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| and have lived there for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| They have invested in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| They have invested in their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| And so they have an investment to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood that they bought into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8428)|
| 2:20:35| and built up over the years, you know, for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| And so I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| The other issue is I was surprised to learn that I believe it's Shackleford Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| and I want to make sure I'm exactly correct on this, so tell me if I'm not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| School buses will not go down this road because it's so narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| because the kids have to walk to another area to catch the school bus because the road is narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| Now, a lot of roads in Knox County are like this because they're rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| and this is a very rural area, and it's, you know, just a lot of great, beautiful, rolling farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| I actually took some pictures while I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| And, Jolie, if you can put the picture up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| I want to think a picture is worth maybe a word or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| I don't know if you can see that well or not with the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| But I wanted to take a picture of the road because, obviously, regardless of what goes on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| some road improvements are going to have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| And when they told me that kids cannot catch the bus there because the road is so narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| I thought, well, I need to see just exactly how long the road is or how wide the road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8495)|
| 2:21:42| Well, this is the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| As you can see, this is the road in front of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| So it's not very big at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| And you can see toward the top up there, that's a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| So they had told me that, you know, there's a couple of blind hills, and there's one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| and I have some more pictures on the other side as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| So it's obvious that there's going to have to be some road improvements made if you're going to have people come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| and out of there and if you're going to be looking at big equipment that's going to be going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| and going to the, as you're looking, the development, I believe, is to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| And so there is a lot of hills and that type of thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8533)|
| 2:22:17| So the character of this neighborhood, that's not the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8537)|
| 2:22:24| The character of the neighborhood would be one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| And that's why I'm supporting it is because I believe that the people who have been there for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| and who have built their homes and invested, you know, their investments in their property and their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8551)|
| 2:22:37| they are not against the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| They just want to maintain the integrity of what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| And putting two to three units right across the street on a very narrow road, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| is not in keeping with the integrity of that community and what they're trying to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8567)|
| 2:22:53| and the investments that they've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| So I guess, Mr. Chairman, this is why I seconded the motion is I'm in favor of the one unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| and I will be voting in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| Yeah, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| Even when they were looking at two units to an acre or three units to an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| is there sewers out there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| It's our understanding that sewer would have to be extended to this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| and that would be factored in when we review a development plan and concept plan for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8597)|
| 2:23:23| Number one, whether or not sewer can be extended and it would support the development proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8603)|
| 2:23:31| The other issue would be that they would have to address those access issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| primarily how to handle Shackleford Road or Lane, any kind of improvements there, and also on graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8617)|
| 2:23:45| So that, you know, that is factored into the plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| It would not necessarily guarantee that either at three or at two, you know, we would recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8631)|
| 2:23:57| MPC would recommend a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| It would have to be based on whether or not that infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| those infrastructure issues can be satisfied with that development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| Generally, when the MPC is determining how many units can go into an acreage where you do not have sewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8646)|
| 2:24:14| are there any guidelines such as where you're having to use a septic system where you can just put one unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8654)|
| 2:24:21| or does it depend on the soil type and how that perks when that determination is made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| I believe the baseline is one acre, but as I understand, in my experience with reviewing plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| especially in this area with the health department, they may actually require more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| And you use the key word, how the soil perks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| And do we know anything about the soil there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| or was this determination being based on the premise that there would be city sewers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8686)|
| 2:24:53| or some sort of sewer system if you're going to put two units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| Well, actually, we go back to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| It shows it as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| It's also in what is called the plan growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| which envisions in some locations throughout the county a little bit higher intensity use than you would have in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8703)|
| 2:25:12| So those were the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| That was the beginning point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8714)|
| 2:25:15| But then when we got into it and we looked at it, the land lays, the land itself lays pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| But we understand about the access issues, and we understand about, you know, the need for sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8721)|
| 2:25:29| or proper wastewater treatment as, you know, be dictated by whatever development is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8729)|
| 2:25:37| Again, it, you know, the zoning gives him an opportunity or the developer an opportunity to present a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8737)|
| 2:25:47| and then we would base a review on that plan on the factors that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8747)|
| 2:25:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| Mr. Campbell, you mentioned that this property owner purchased this some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8761)|
| 2:26:08| I was under the impression it was a recent purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| and that at the time the purchase was made, the purchaser was told that there had to be a minimum of one to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8771)|
| 2:26:19| and he signed a form, a paper of some sort, to agree to that at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| Can you confirm or deny that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| Commissioner Brown, I'm holding a letter here that says they've owned the property since 1985,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| and I'm not certain whether that maybe somebody else could confirm that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| I did look at the documents that said that one unit to the acre, but it did not say anything about rezoning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8799)|
| 2:26:46| I was told that they signed something saying they couldn't rezone the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| but when we examined the documents, it didn't exactly say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| So I'm not aware of their signing anything that said they couldn't do anything more dense than one unit to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| Well, under current, it's ag right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| Which in the county determines that it can only be one to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| And the only way to change that would be to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| The planned residential zone has more flexibility than agricultural zoning for individual residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| so that's another benefit of planned residential versus agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| But you know nothing of this man's agreement to one to an acre in some sort of signed document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8840)|
| 2:27:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| Does anybody in the audience know of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| My name is Robbie Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| I live at 8683 Shackleford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| This property, to include the planned residential track of 52 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8860)|
| 2:27:47| was sold at public auction by Furrow Auction Company, of which I'm an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8867)|
| 2:27:54| that was sold in 1985 for the Plummer family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8874)|
| 2:28:00| It was part of the original Blake Dairy Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8880)|
| 2:28:03| It goes way back in the history of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| This particular track, the 52 acres, at the time of the public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| was sold in its most divisible small tracks that the county health department would approve for percolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8893)|
| 2:28:23| This particular 52 acres, it is underlaying with limestone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| and there is percolation issues on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| I believe the 52 acres was sold in a total of seven tracks, the smallest track being five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8917)|
| 2:28:46| and the larger tracks being somewhere in the seven or eight acre range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8926)|
| 2:28:53| But we divided the property in as small a tracks as we could possibly divide them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8933)|
| 2:28:59| that the county health department would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| If we could have sold it in one acre tracks at that point in time, then we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8941)|
| 2:29:08| But to go to one house per acre, sewer will be required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8948)|
| 2:29:17| and the closest sewer to the property is on Ruggles Ferry Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| and it will have to be brought down Ruggles Ferry to Graves Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| and down Graves Road and then out Shackleford Road, probably over half a mile of sewer line in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8967)|
| 2:29:34| Or the other option for this property is there is a sewer plant, treatment plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8974)|
| 2:29:42| on the opposite side of the Holston River that services the industrial park off of Mascot Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8982)|
| 2:29:53| and they could buy access and run a sewer line over to that treatment plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=8993)|
| 2:30:00| and pump the sewer to that facility by running the sewer line either under or through the Holston River with that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9000)|
| 2:30:12| But that's how the property was sold, and, again, at the time of the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9012)|
| 2:30:20| there were covenants and restrictions that we all addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9020)|
| 2:30:25| It did not say that the property could not be divided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| but it did state that you had to have county health department approval if you divided the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9029)|
| 2:30:37| and that the property, at the time it was sold, there was a homeowners association formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9037)|
| 2:30:43| Each track carried one vote membership into that homeowners association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9043)|
| 2:30:51| And if you divided your property into smaller tracks, that particular track still only carried one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9051)|
| 2:30:59| even though it was divided into smaller tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| Again, we met with Mr. Campbell and Mr. Taylor at Pleasant Hill United Methodist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9063)|
| 2:31:10| to give them opportunity to tell us what their plans were with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9070)|
| 2:31:18| They met with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| They were very cordial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| They chose not to get into any of the details of the development with the plans that they had for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9080)|
| 2:31:29| And Mr. Taylor, Harry Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9089)|
| 2:31:33| indicated that their reasoning for wanting to go plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9093)|
| 2:31:38| was to maximize the value of their investment in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| And the very reason that we're here today to ask you all to consider keeping the integrity of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9104)|
| 2:31:52| is because each of us has made a sizable investment in our properties in this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9112)|
| 2:31:59| and a much stronger investment because it is our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9119)|
| 2:32:06| So I would appreciate you all giving consideration to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9126)|
| 2:32:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| If I understood you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| the health department would not approve even one to an acre on this particular piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9134)|
| 2:32:22| It has to be within the five to sevens that are laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| Is that what you're telling me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| Based on what they approved for the auction in 1985, that is all they would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| They would approve us selling the tracks in five to eight acre tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| I can't imagine the topography underneath all that much, 52 acres, changing any in the last 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9158)|
| 2:32:51| It was 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9171)|
| 2:32:52| 95?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| If it was 100 years, I can't see those rocks moving underneath there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| So I'm going to be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| Ms. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| I just want to clarify Dave's motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9191)|
| 2:33:21| You're going to recommend that it is rezoned from agricultural to planned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9201)|
| 2:33:30| That's my motion, but I'm going to call on the audience again to see if the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9210)|
| 2:33:38| which way the opposition wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| Because I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| The other side of the motion could be to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9226)|
| 2:33:47| I am in favor of leaving it agricultural rather than moving it to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| As you know, I've served on the Food Policy Council now for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| And I tell you what, our local farmland is very valuable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9238)|
| 2:34:03| Are you making that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| I would like to make a substitute motion that it's denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| and that we leave it agricultural rather than planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| I think our local farmland, as we move forward, is going to become an even more important part of our local food economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9251)|
| 2:34:17| And we need to keep it intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| I would like to sort of poll the audience here to see if that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| I do see heads out there shaking, yes, they want to leave it agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| I'll second her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| You know, I kind of hate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| It's like we're hashing this out real time, and that does concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9287)|
| 2:34:54| You know, a whole lot went into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| And I guess I'll look to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| And do you all mind giving a little bit of a zoning history lesson as to what the difference is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| I know folks are shaking their head, but I don't know what the difference is between planned residential one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| agricultural one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9312)|
| 2:35:13| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| I don't mind at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| The agricultural zone district is what we refer to as a basic zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9318)|
| 2:35:27| In order to control the density, it establishes a minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| In the ag zone district, that minimum lot size is one unit or one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9332)|
| 2:35:37| So any development which requires the platting of new roads will chip away at that density of one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9337)|
| 2:35:48| So you ultimately will yield something like eight-tenths of a unit per acre under an ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9348)|
| 2:35:55| depending on how you lie with the roads and how straight you make them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| and what your topography is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| The planned residential zone district is what we refer to as a planned zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9362)|
| 2:36:07| which is a two-step district requiring development plan approval prior to any permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9367)|
| 2:36:15| and platting by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| And it allows flexibility as far as the minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| but controls density through establishing a cap, usually expressed in terms of number of units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9383)|
| 2:36:30| So one unit per acre on a 51-acre parcel would yield 51 potential lots or dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9390)|
| 2:36:38| and you could arrange those any way that you wanted to with any flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9398)|
| 2:36:43| that you ultimately got approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| It provides an opportunity to save distinctive pieces of the property as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9406)|
| 2:36:53| It allows the developer to reduce his infrastructure by clustering his development together in smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9413)|
| 2:37:01| And with a proper land plan, you could respect the rhythm of the lots across Shackleford Lane from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9421)|
| 2:37:10| for example, and mimic that rather than get into a regimented one-acre lot size that is more than likely under an ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9430)|
| 2:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9442)|
| 2:37:23| And that's kind of what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9443)|
| 2:37:24| You know, I don't know if the residents really want ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| I think with us kind of rushing through this, I think we might need to dig into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| So as far as the features of your neighborhood, the beauty of your neighborhood, it may be better to go plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9453)|
| 2:37:40| Now, here's what I'll say, because then you're going to get a systematic unit of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9460)|
| 2:37:48| If you go 52 acres, you're going to get a house per acre regardless whether it's uphill, downhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9468)|
| 2:37:53| whatever the lay of the land is, and you're going to be stuck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9473)|
| 2:37:57| So I just think that the more we in general can kind of plan things, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| if there's a clustering that could happen, that may be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| It may be nicer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| But just to kind of hash it out tonight, I really would want against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9490)|
| 2:38:16| And I think the developer and his attorney, they've kind of heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9496)|
| 2:38:22| you're probably not going to end up with two per acre, what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| So I think you've kind of heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| So now there might be a chance to go back and have a serious dialogue about what you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| So for us to pass something here, I'll just put it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| You know, we're hearing what you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9518)|
| 2:38:41| I think now may be a good time to have a serious conversation about what do we want these 52 acres to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| But that's, you know, so I don't know the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9526)|
| 2:38:51| I have a substitute motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| But, you know, again, personally, I don't think you're going to get this three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| I don't think you're going to get two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| But that's just me, you know, going about a little bit of conjecture here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| How do you want that one acre, one lot per acre to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9543)|
| 2:39:10| And so now to me, now is a good time to have a serious conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9550)|
| 2:39:15| You know, I can't put another motion out there because there's already a substitute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| You've done a good job with your point, though, and you may get that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9569)|
| 2:39:30| Mr. McKenzie, thank you for bringing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| And I'd like for the law director to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| And let's hear the motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| I'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| We've gone back and forth on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| Let's hear the motion if you want to weigh in, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| There's some good points being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9583)|
| 2:39:46| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9586)|
| 2:39:49| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| Yeah, the substitute motion that I made was to deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9590)|
| 2:39:54| But if, and I'll be guided by Commissioner Wright since this is his district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9594)|
| 2:40:00| what he thinks is in the best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| I always prefer for neighborhoods and developers to come together and work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9602)|
| 2:40:07| If the developer understands that they're not going to get two per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9607)|
| 2:40:12| I don't think under any circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| and they're willing to get together with the neighborhood and see what they can work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| I'm all in favor of giving the neighborhood as much flexibility as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| I'll be happy to withdraw that, but I'm going to abide by Dave's counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| This is his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| Commissioner Wright, would you weigh in at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9631)|
| 2:40:32| And I'm not going to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| in that I'm expecting something from the constituent here to direct us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9634)|
| 2:40:42| This clustering, this planned residential density of one to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9642)|
| 2:40:48| is something that's only been on their plate for about an hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9648)|
| 2:40:56| because as we approached the meeting tonight, it was either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9656)|
| 2:41:06| As you're presenting it, Commissioner Broyles, it's either approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9666)|
| 2:41:13| The motion that I made was to have planned residential at three to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9673)|
| 2:41:20| And I'm going to planned residential of one, planned residential density of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9680)|
| 2:41:29| and I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| Who do I need to look to back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9691)|
| 2:41:39| Name and address, Paul Schmierbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9699)|
| 2:41:45| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9705)|
| 2:41:46| My name is Paul Schmierbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| I live at 8677 Shackleford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| I'm a registered engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| And I guess hearing the discussion here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| and I haven't, of course, polled all these good people who are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| but it seems to me that hearing the discussion that you all are having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9724)|
| 2:42:13| the obvious thing to do with this situation is to turn it back to the zoning that it was under previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9733)|
| 2:42:20| and give the opportunity for the developer to come talk to us more about plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9740)|
| 2:42:28| that they may have to want to go to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9748)|
| 2:42:36| So that's kind of where I'm coming down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| You know, I don't know that I understand all the nuances between the planned residential and the agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9761)|
| 2:42:49| but it was agriculture, so no harm, no foul if we go back to agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9769)|
| 2:42:58| I think the problem would be if we voted it down, they could not bring it back under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9778)|
| 2:43:05| So what I would do then is I would withdraw my substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| and then make a substitute motion that we defer this for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| and give the developer and the community an opportunity to get together and explore these other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9794)|
| 2:43:20| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| I didn't withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| And I have a comment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| If the health department, whether it was five years, ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| in this case 18 years ago, said that even if you put it one to the acre, you're going to have to have sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9812)|
| 2:43:39| Unless he says, I'm going to put sewers in there, we can't even put one to the acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| They've already got it set up in the division of what the percolation test will take on that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9824)|
| 2:43:52| And if anything else we do would be going against health regulations for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9832)|
| 2:43:58| So, again, if she's going to withdraw her motion, I will restate the motion that I move this be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9838)|
| 2:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9846)|
| 2:44:07| But are you, first of all, have you stated whether you will allow her to, on the second, are you in agreement with withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9847)|
| 2:44:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| Withdraw her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| Her motion is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| My motion is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| And I have a question that I need clarification from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9867)|
| 2:44:28| About the sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| Would MPC have approved this if the health department were still opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9869)|
| 2:44:38| Well, my understanding is the health department is only on record with regard to a development that does not have sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9878)|
| 2:44:46| So they've said that the land will support a certain density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9886)|
| 2:44:51| If sanitary sewer is delivered to the property, all bets are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9895)|
| 2:44:56| And it's a whole new ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| So it is okay with the health department to develop it with this density if sewer is extended that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9897)|
| 2:45:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9903)|
| 2:45:04| And that would be under KEB's purview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| And the developer would have to pay for that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| So that leaves the health department out of this discussion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| Under those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| Under these circumstances, the health department, what they say, is moot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9918)|
| 2:45:24| So I would prefer that we give the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| and the community an opportunity to discuss this clustering versus leaving it agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9928)|
| 2:45:34| But that's up to you at this point, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9934)|
| 2:45:39| I still think they can't move the rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| And the health department is not going to approve that right now, the way it sits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9944)|
| 2:45:49| even at one to the acre, based on what they've said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| Well, we don't really know what they've said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| I have to respectfully disagree with Mr. Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| There's no --I've looked at the preliminary soil maps on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| and it is not one unit per acre property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| So I don't know why they decided five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| It's really not having to do with anything on the soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9969)|
| 2:46:12| So that's just my ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| As the applicant, we've not been unsympathetic to the wishes of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| I personally think that planned residential, for the exact reasons Commissioner McKenzie explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9978)|
| 2:46:24| planned residential gives us the opportunity to cluster and to preserve areas, buffer areas and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9984)|
| 2:46:30| And that's what we would want to ---- that's the way we would want it to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| If we want to see it cut up like a cookie cutter with every lot having something, every acre having something on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| then that would be the scenario in which it would remain agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=9998)|
| 2:46:42| I think the wishes of the neighbors are much better protected by a planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| at something like one unit to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| Then they only have one shot at it because it doesn't come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| It goes under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| It's all approved by MPC, cut and dried, so long, sayonara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| But MPC has to review and approve the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| so they do have another step to go through to scrutinize and to critique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10020)|
| 2:47:06| Mr. Sanders, the law director of Pine here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10026)|
| 2:47:13| I see a little bit of the cart going before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10033)|
| 2:47:17| The health department will be involved in any development of a single-family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10037)|
| 2:47:23| It will either have a drain fill and a secondary area for a drain fill, and it will perk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10043)|
| 2:47:29| or it will have access to a sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10049)|
| 2:47:34| That's a separate issue from potential density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10054)|
| 2:47:39| As it sits now, the property is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10059)|
| 2:47:42| You can have one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| The health department will weigh in on each residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10065)|
| 2:47:48| and determine whether it can be developed on the lot that it's subdivided on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10068)|
| 2:47:55| The health department review, they sign off on the subdivision plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| but that is further down the road than we are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| with either development under an ag zone or a PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10082)|
| 2:48:07| So the density that you set today or don't set today is sort of immaterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10087)|
| 2:48:14| of the review that the health department would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| and that comes later under either zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| They won't be able to increase the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| but they could surely decrease the density if the property doesn't perk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| But we don't have the health department here to weigh in on that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10108)|
| 2:48:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| It looks like we're heading in the direction of having one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| And the question is whether we're going to have one unit per acre under an agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| or one unit per acre under a planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| I would think that we would be better off having this under planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10132)|
| 2:48:58| because it gives a lot more flexibility of the community to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| And it goes back, in any case, to the MPC for approval of the concept plan after that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10142)|
| 2:49:11| And to address some of the concerns that Amy may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| you may want to have maybe two units in an acre and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| and do that collectively for part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10159)|
| 2:49:24| And then you could have some open space where you may want to have a community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| You cannot do that if it remains under agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10167)|
| 2:49:33| There may be certain places on the land where there's a stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| or there's certain topographical features that you don't want to build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| and you'll cluster a little bit more someplace else to leave that part open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| And I think we would be better off having this under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| It still would come back to the MPC to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10189)|
| 2:49:52| The health department is really extraneous to this because, first of all, you know, in all respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10192)|
| 2:49:59| we're just hearing what someone's recollection was from 18 years ago, 1995,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10199)|
| 2:50:05| whenever it was, about what the health department said then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| and we really don't know all the reasoning behind what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| So I think the plans have to come first, and then the health department will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| we can do this with drainage fields and a septic system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| or we can do this by having to put a sewer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| But, you know, I think it would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| I think the neighborhood would have more input under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| If you want to keep some houses away from something, you can do that easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| than if we have a cookie cutter, 52 acres or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| where everybody is one acre, period, and there's no flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| And, you know, my personal preference would be to vote for one unit per acre under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10241)|
| 2:50:48| Mr. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10251)|
| 2:50:52| I agree with what Dr. Dabrisch just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10252)|
| 2:50:54| and that I think it does give the residents that live out there more option under the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10254)|
| 2:51:03| or more say-so, I guess, of what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10263)|
| 2:51:07| The problem it's come to now is, are the two sides going to be able to agree to the one per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10267)|
| 2:51:16| I'm in favor of the one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10276)|
| 2:51:18| That keeps in the standing of what's already currently out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10278)|
| 2:51:22| and I have driven out there, and those roads are very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10282)|
| 2:51:26| Two houses per acre, which was approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10286)|
| 2:51:31| talking, I think their estimates from MPC was 1,500 cars on those streets on Shackleford and Graves a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10291)|
| 2:51:42| and that's a large number on those narrow roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10302)|
| 2:51:48| So I would be voting against the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10308)|
| 2:51:54| and hope that we're able to vote on Commissioner Wright's original motion of one per acre under planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10314)|
| 2:52:00| I think that gives you all a better option in keeping with what you already currently have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10320)|
| 2:52:07| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| I want to make sure that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10330)|
| 2:52:11| So let's say option A is that we defer this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10331)|
| 2:52:16| Will MPC help facilitate a meeting between the developer and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| to talk about what might be in the best interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| Will you all facilitate that, or who will help facilitate that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| We would attend if asked, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| Because I think it would be helpful for someone to be there to just kind of help facilitate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| That's just my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| Secondly, let's say that we keep it agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| And we say, basically denying this, and say, let's keep it agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| What then does MPC do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| Nothing, or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| Well, the next time we might see that property is when they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| and ask to start the platting process, which moves us into the quasi-judicial phase of our lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10374)|
| 2:53:02| where if people meet all of the requirements, we're compelled to approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10382)|
| 2:53:07| It would allow piecemeal development of the property rather than looking at it holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10387)|
| 2:53:18| And if somebody brings in a plat that meets all of the requirements, we're compelled to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10398)|
| 2:53:26| So how much input would the citizens have in that scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10406)|
| 2:53:33| We conduct a public hearing, but our hands are pretty much tied as far as accommodating all of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10413)|
| 2:53:43| Through the platting process and the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| the discretion of the Planning Commission is minimized, and following the regulations is maximized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10427)|
| 2:53:57| So there is little discretion based on public testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| So if we go with planned residential, one dwelling unit per acre, tell me the scenario then of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10442)|
| 2:54:10| That keeps it in the zoning part of the development review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10450)|
| 2:54:16| and allows the Planning Commission discretion to consider the character of the surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10456)|
| 2:54:23| the character of the land within the guidelines that have been established by the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| which would be whatever density you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| The Planning Commission is given fairly broad discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| in establishing what the actual development plan will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10477)|
| 2:54:41| How much will these citizens have with regards to input in that scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10481)|
| 2:54:45| There would be a public hearing at which their voice actually matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10485)|
