| 2:31:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| So we have a motion by Ms. Owen to delegate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| writing a resolution to the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| and a second by Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| Just a question of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| I don't know that the law is explicit in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| but my presumption, Ms. Owen, is you're not asking for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| to be done tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9112)|
| 2:31:52| No, my expectation would be that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| are delegating the entire responsibility to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| OK, so my question then, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| is in delegating that, the board would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9125)|
| 2:32:05| And then my second question is, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| asking for confirmation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| And then my second question is, by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| does that have to happen tonight in the same meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| that the vote, the original vote occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9136)|
| 2:32:24| I know you're like all up in murky waters here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9146)|
| 2:32:27| Yeah, yeah, it's not the best place to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| So the law says that the board has to be the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9150)|
| 2:32:37| to have it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| So I would agree with your statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| that even if the director of schools and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| are writing it, the board would then have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9167)|
| 2:32:52| And the other question was, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| have to be at this meeting, it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| has to be done before May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| And then if it is done before May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| because I know we have another meeting that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| coming up that we could possibly attach a special call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| meeting to, does the timeline for which they have to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| also have to occur before May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| or does the whole timeline get extended at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| Because they have 30 days to respond, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| So let's say on the 27th, I think that's our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| Is that when our other meeting is called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| Yeah, so let's say on the 27th, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| do another special call meeting right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9208)|
| 2:33:29| before or after the budget meeting where this is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| And that resolution gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| then does the 30 days then extend that ultimate timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| of May 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| Yes, I mean, the charter's applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| would have to have that 30 days to respond to the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| Right, irregardless of what the original end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| date was for our action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| Mr. Dupour, another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Like I said, I would rather proceed with this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9235)|
| 2:33:58| We're here, Chattanooga Prep's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| You know, I don't agree with putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| that on the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| This is their responsibility, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| do feel like that we have to be the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| comes up with the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| But my other question is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| if it's going to do that, at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| we would have nine people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9257)|
| 2:34:21| So I wouldn't be voting on a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9261)|
| 2:34:24| I would ask that we revisit the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| But again, my preference is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| complete this business tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9269)|
| 2:34:33| So are you asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| Right, I mean, we could put the charter application itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| back up for a vote at a separate meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| Yes, if the board calls a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| So you can't have the same vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| But if the board were to call a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| if the board were to call a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| before May 1st, then you could open up that question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| Mr. Dupler, I believe that when we vote on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| nothing else can be voted on at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9318)|
| 2:35:23| Isn't there something that says that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| So you're right, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| So what would have to occur is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| would have to be a special called meeting for the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| and a special called meeting for the charter application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| It would have to be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| You could do it at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| but just 10 minutes apart or five minutes apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| Yeah, two separate meetings, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| I yield to Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| I'd like to withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| Are we in discussion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| Yes, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| No, she withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| So yes, we're back to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| So I think that we ought to handle it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| And I have four things to offer based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| on what I have and one other thing someone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| if I may share those at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| In the area of economic disadvantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| discrepancies between the Chattanooga PREP plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| and the state data would be, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| would be a corrective action is what I'm understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| So it would be resolve economic disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| data with the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9412)|
| 2:36:56| The second one along that line about the suspension data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9416)|
| 2:37:00| resolve suspension data with, resolve discrepancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9420)|
| 2:37:07| with suspension data with the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| Number three would be present a more accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9432)|
| 2:37:19| present more accurate information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| concerning community engagement, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| persons and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| Present more accurate information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| concerning community engagement, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9448)|
| 2:37:30| persons and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| And then number four would be address special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9454)|
| 2:37:44| in a more, in a broader, in a more strategic way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9464)|
| 2:37:50| a more specific way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| So that would be those four, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| are the four things that I would want the resolution to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9474)|
| 2:38:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9484)|
| 2:38:04| Reverend Butler, are you presenting those four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| as a motion, or are you just opening up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9487)|
| 2:38:08| for further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| Well, I didn't know if anybody else had something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| So if anyone else has something to add or take away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| quite honestly, I would want to hear some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| Because someone may say, well, I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9503)|
| 2:38:23| But if I need to put it in the form of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| tell me what I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Yeah, point of clarification for your intent on the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| where you said present more accurate information regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| community engagement, including individuals and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| Are you asking specifically about community support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| or are you just asking those that they've engaged with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| Well, thank you so much, community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| But I'm not sure what the heading of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9526)|
| 2:38:49| was in their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| It would be under the community engagement title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| But I just want to be clear that the question you're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| is who's supporting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9535)|
| 2:38:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9538)|
| 2:38:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| And what I mean by more accurate information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| is that the way that it reads, one can, and I'm that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9542)|
| 2:39:09| can read it that it means support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9549)|
| 2:39:13| Or it means more than just reaching out to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| It means you talk with them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9556)|
| 2:39:17| So I think that we need to be more specific about what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| is so we know what the applications really say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| And I think there's room in the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9566)|
| 2:39:27| It is, honestly, the original way that I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| I did ask for clarification of the school through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| and began to understand that that's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| their intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9576)|
| 2:39:37| But I was not able to get specificity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| nor did I ask for specificity about every individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| So I think having some specificity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| about who supports versus who doesn't would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| And I think that as far as a written application is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9588)|
| 2:39:53| concerned, it's what's in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| It's not what someone says to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9596)|
| 2:39:59| And one of the things that, from a grant writer and grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| provider perspective, if you have to explain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| you need to write it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| I know that this is probably, so one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| of the things that's been referenced in support of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| or to verify support for the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| is 75 letters of intent from potential students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| that might want to enroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9624)|
| 2:40:25| And I know that we cannot, nor would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| I ask for personal information about individual students that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| are trying to enroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| I know that that needs to be protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| I don't know if there's a way to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| able to verify those letters of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| but I think that could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| I'm not saying what the information has to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| but I just think we need to have more accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| And sometimes specific also means accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| So Mr. Dupler, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| I think the best approach here would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| to have Dr. Butler make a motion for each item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9655)|
| 2:41:05| And then with a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| we will do a roll call vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| Yes, you could do that, or if Dr. Butler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| wants to make it one motion with all four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| I mean, but yeah, that's either or, it's his choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| What would you prefer, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9683)|
| 2:41:30| One of the reasons why I was just opening it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| if somebody objects to one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| then I won't put it in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9697)|
| 2:41:38| My thought is you just list your reasons, and then we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| And then list your reasons, and we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| And we list your reasons and vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| and we just work our way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| And if some make it on a list, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| If some don't, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| And then you have a resolution at the end, or not, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| Does anybody else, Ms. Byke, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| Yeah, I just have some additional reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| that I would like to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| But how are we going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| All right, well, then let's start with Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| We'll let him do his reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| So I move that we have, I'd like to do them one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9728)|
| 2:42:13| if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| Because that way, you won't eliminate all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| Or you might still eliminate all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| But at least each one of them have their own merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| Resolve economic, I move that we have, as a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| or as a corrective action, resolve economic disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9747)|
| 2:42:32| data of the Chattanooga plan, and from here on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| I'm going to say CP, CP plan with the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9757)|
| 2:42:43| All right, so we have a motion to resolve the discrepancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9763)|
| 2:42:56| Was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9776)|
| 2:42:56| Discrepancies, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| I think that was what you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| So resolve the economic discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| between the application and the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| Economic disadvantage data discrepancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| Economic disadvantage data discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| with the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| OK, so do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| I second, and I would offer a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| to the motion that, in the corrective action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| that there are citations provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| That they provide the citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| With citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| Yes, with citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| With citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| I accept the friendly amendment with citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9814)|
| 2:43:41| OK, so did you get that, Ms. Covey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9821)|
| 2:43:50| Do you want me to repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| OK, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9836)|
| 2:44:00| We can't vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9840)|
| 2:44:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9841)|
| 2:44:02| He can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| He can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9843)|
| 2:44:03| We can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| He can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| OK, so would you read that back, Ms. Covey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| So I believe the motion is to list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9847)|
| 2:44:12| one of the reasons in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| to resolve discrepancy for economic disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| data between Chattanooga PREP and state data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9859)|
| 2:44:22| with citations provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| We have that motion by Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| a second by Mr. Watson, and Ms. Coatney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| let's do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9879)|
| 2:44:40| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9883)|
| 2:44:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9885)|
| 2:44:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| That is, and Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| That is four yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| Second, I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| Hold on, in that, you still had to five, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| OK, so that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| Well, it has to be five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| OK, well, if that's the case, let's just go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| to what Ms. Owen said, because, I mean, just to be realistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| and I'm tired of faking it, y'all ain't going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9918)|
| 2:45:22| for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| So we had a stalemate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| So we're the stalemate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| Let's just not pretend we're not and keep everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| I'm just, you all going to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| I reached a point of frustration that I don't fake it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9932)|
| 2:45:35| I just got to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| And that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| If I offer this second one, and this third one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| and this fourth one, it's going to be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| So why am I doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| So if that's the case, let's do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| we need to do so we can pack it up and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Since we have this public meeting opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| maybe it would be helpful if someone who voted no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| could go ahead and take this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| to explain to the community why we would vote for an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9964)|
| 2:46:09| to not correct the economic data in their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9969)|
| 2:46:19| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| I voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9981)|
| 2:46:22| I know, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| I didn't know if you had anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| The motion was denied, so do you have a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9994)|
| 2:46:38| There was no motion to deny with reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=9998)|
| 2:46:47| The reason was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| I think the vote went for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| No, the reason, but there has to be a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| to deny with reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| What she's asking is we have to give reasons for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| So the board has to have some reasons, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| And that motion was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| So currently, there is no reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| and there needs to be another motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| if you're going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| Let me just continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10032)|
| 2:47:17| Y'all, I will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| If you're going to continue, you need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| Hold on just a minute, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| I said this, it's been a while, I said this at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| but if we're going to have conversations among ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| I would ask that you step outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10051)|
| 2:47:32| I think we need a motion to continue, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| No, we don't have a motion to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| No, you just need more motions if you're going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| Yeah, that stopped my frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| May I have a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| I think it's important to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| that we have already denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| So we could be here all night making motions for reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10072)|
| 2:47:57| until we get one that actually passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10077)|
| 2:48:06| I will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| Just a point of order, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10090)|
| 2:48:11| If no motion's passed, someone could move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| Anybody want to make that motion now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| I'll make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| I'll move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| If we're going to do this for the next hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| we don't want to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| Adjourn and continue with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| So are we adjourning the meeting, or are we adjourning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10120)|
| 2:48:44| This is the last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| So the motion would be to adjourn the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| but still have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10128)|
| 2:48:52| Was that what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| Is that the order today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| I'd like to have a roll call vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| Was there a second to that, to the motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10138)|
| 2:49:04| Well, I don't think it's the motion to adjourn, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| It's the motion to stop the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| What we're on is G, discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| That's what we're still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| Reverend Butler's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| I mean, technically, and Mr. Triplett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10156)|
| 2:49:19| you correct me if I'm wrong, your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| would be to end all discussion, end all action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10161)|
| 2:49:25| on this particular item, move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10165)|
| 2:49:28| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10168)|
| 2:49:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| And we still need a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10170)|
| 2:49:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10175)|
| 2:49:36| So we have a motion to end discussion on this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| and continue with public forum by Mr. Triplett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10181)|
| 2:49:44| and a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| Is that motion discussable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10188)|
| 2:49:49| Because I guess, did I make up a word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| I guess my question is, what are we going to do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| Because we were talking about a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10195)|
| 2:49:58| So if we vote yes, then we stop talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| so we won't be able to talk about what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10205)|
| 2:50:05| Well, it's my understanding from Mr. Dupler earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| that since the charter application failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| if the application fails without reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| that on May 1st, it will automatically be authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| If that happens, so let's say we adjourn, nothing happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| and then it gets automatically authorized on May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| who is the LEA at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| Who's the authorizer at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| So what was the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| If we do nothing right now, and we get to May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10246)|
| 2:50:49| and it gets automatically authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10249)|
| 2:50:50| who becomes the LEA and the authorizer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| Is it the state, or is it us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| No, it'd be Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| because it's been allowed to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10258)|
| 2:51:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10262)|
| 2:51:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10268)|
| 2:51:17| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10279)|
| 2:51:20| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| Are we on the motion to end discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10282)|
| 2:51:24| We're on the motion to end discussion on item 12G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| and move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| Ms. Bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10292)|
| 2:51:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10293)|
| 2:51:34| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10294)|
| 2:51:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10295)|
| 2:51:36| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10296)|
| 2:51:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10298)|
| 2:51:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10299)|
| 2:51:40| That's three yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| I move that we resolve that we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10307)|
| 2:51:47| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10307)|
| 2:51:48| I have to, for the record, announce that that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10310)|
| 2:51:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10311)|
| 2:51:52| So motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10312)|
| 2:51:53| So yes, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| I apologize for starting too early, trying to get fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10317)|
| 2:52:02| I move, as a reason, that we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10322)|
| 2:52:10| the CP to resolve the suspension data discrepancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10330)|
| 2:52:19| with the state data, with citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10344)|
| 2:52:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10351)|
| 2:52:31| So we have a motion by Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| Ms. Coatney, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| Can you restate it and do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| Yes, I believe the motion is to state on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| the reason that they want Chattanooga Prep to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| suspension data with state data with citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| And Mr. Watson seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10373)|

| 2:53:01| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10382)|
| 2:53:03| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10383)|
| 2:53:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| That's four yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10385)|
| 2:53:07| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| I have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| As a reason, I move that CP present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10392)|
| 2:53:18| more accurate, specific information concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10398)|
| 2:53:23| community engagement and community support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| including people and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10415)|
| 2:53:36| We're going to give Ms. Coatney a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10416)|
| 2:53:37| to catch up with you there, because she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| has to write these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10419)|
| 2:53:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10427)|
| 2:53:48| So we have a motion by Dr. Butler, a second by Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10428)|
| 2:53:53| Ms. Coatney, if you will restate that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| and do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10435)|
| 2:54:04| Yes, the motion is for Chattanooga Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| to present more accurate information on community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| engagement and support with individuals and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| And Ms. Byke seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10455)|

| 2:54:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10460)|
| 2:54:20| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10460)|
| 2:54:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10461)|

| 2:54:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| That's four yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10469)|
| 2:54:32| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| I move that CP provide more specific plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10476)|
| 2:54:46| to address special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| And I may need some help with that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10488)|
| 2:54:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| So the motion was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10500)|
| 2:55:05| So Dr. Butler's motion was for Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| Prep to provide more specific plans to address special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10507)|
| 2:55:11| And that was seconded by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10515)|
| 2:55:15| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10517)|
| 2:55:18| Ms. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10519)|
| 2:55:19| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10521)|
| 2:55:22| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10524)|
| 2:55:24| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10524)|

| 2:55:29| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10530)|
| 2:55:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| That's four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| So the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10535)|
| 2:55:42| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| So your lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| So are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10548)|
| 2:55:49| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| I would like to offer a motion to ask Chattanooga Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| to resolve any discrepancies within citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| within their current application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10561)|
| 2:56:08| And I can discuss now, correct, since I has a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10568)|
| 2:56:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10571)|
| 2:56:14| So this speaks to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| I'm not being off task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| I just want to elevate for the public what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| doing here in my estimation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| Regardless of whether or not how the vote turned out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| on approving or denying, approving failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| That was the will of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| And we can't help that one member was not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| And that may have changed that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| But we've also been asked by state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| that when that occurs, that we give reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| And I think every reason that we have provided up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| until this point is simply to ask ChattPrep to do what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| think they would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| Honestly, I would think, I'm assuming this isn't true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| that ChattPrep would want to resolve any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| Mr. Scott, is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| You would want to resolve any issues that we might feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10621)|
| 2:57:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| I would want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| If I was filling out an application for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| I would want to resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10632)|
| 2:57:13| Even if I didn't feel like I was being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| I'm not suggesting that anybody was being deceitful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| in creating the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| But when you have a 372 page application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| I'm not surprised that there are some things that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| don't understand or some discrepancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| And all we're doing is asking for those to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10649)|
| 2:57:32| And so obviously, we are at a stalemate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10652)|
| 2:57:36| And it's just interesting to me that we would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10656)|
| 2:57:42| provide that opportunity to the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| to correct any challenges that the board feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| that's there when the original application was not approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10670)|
| 2:57:58| All right, so we have a motion by Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| and a second by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10683)|
| 2:58:04| The motion is to ask Chattanooga Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| to resolve any discrepancies within their application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| with some patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| And that was seconded by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10692)|
| 2:58:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10693)|

| 2:58:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10707)|
| 2:58:28| That's four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10714)|
| 2:58:36| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10716)|
| 2:58:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10726)|
| 2:58:49| All right, so we have no other motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| I'd like to make a motion to include in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10735)|
| 2:59:05| reasons for denial, which we all are aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10745)|
| 2:59:13| that have been discussed in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| including discrepancies in financial data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10756)|
| 2:59:22| discrepancies in suspension data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10762)|
| 2:59:28| and discrepancies in community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10768)|
| 2:59:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10774)|
| 2:59:40| Ms. Coatney's got to catch up writing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| All right, will you restate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| We have a motion by Ms. Owen and a second by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| Did you make that second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10789)|
| 2:59:50| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10790)|
| 2:59:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10791)|
| 2:59:51| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| The motion is to include in a resolution reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| for discrepancies that have been discussed in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| including discrepancies in financial data, suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10799)|
| 3:00:02| data, and discrepancies in community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| That was seconded by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10808)|
| 3:00:09| If I can make a correction, it was reasons for denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| that were discussed in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10820)|
| 3:00:21| Are we going to discuss that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10821)|
| 3:00:26| I would like to point out that the reason I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| making this resolution is because these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10828)|
| 3:00:33| are the reasons that have been discussed in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| These are the reasons that have been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| in a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10839)|
| 3:00:40| These are not reasons that have been discussed off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| in a corner at the side of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| These are the reasons that this board has given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10846)|
| 3:00:52| for the vote that was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| So if we are working in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10855)|
| 3:00:59| the reasons that have been given should be the reasons included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10859)|
| 3:01:03| in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10863)|
| 3:01:04| If we are not working in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10864)|
| 3:01:07| then we can keep denying the reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| are part of the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10870)|
| 3:01:15| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10875)|
| 3:01:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10876)|
| 3:01:17| Mr. Dupler, again, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| I know we're keeping you late and not feeling well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| But just a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| there was a statement made earlier that if a resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| not passed with reasons by May 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| then it will default to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10895)|
| 3:01:36| I just want to verify that that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10896)|
| 3:01:41| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| So by May 1st is the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| I think you said May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| May 1st, that's what I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10906)|
| 3:01:47| It's actually May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10907)|
| 3:01:48| But I mean, if you look at the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| it certainly says that if there is a denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10910)|
| 3:01:55| there must be objective reasons in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| So therefore, the way you would interpret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| that is if the objective reasons are not provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| then it basically makes the denial moot, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| Well, certainly, the applicant could not respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| Right, there would be nothing to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| It's an amended application, as the process calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| I would just like just to clarify that, yes, reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10940)|
| 3:02:24| have been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| But I have never, at any time during this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10945)|
| 3:02:30| heard every board member be in agreement with any reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10950)|
| 3:02:33| that has been discussed in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10953)|
| 3:02:38| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10958)|
| 3:02:44| Mr. Dupler, could you discuss, in legal terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10964)|
| 3:02:50| the will of the board and how it works with voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| and if we don't come up with a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| to go along with the will of the board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10976)|
| 3:03:05| Yeah, thank you, Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| The best way I can, the easiest way I can explain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| is state law requires that boards of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10991)|
| 3:03:16| have majority votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| So that means five votes in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=10997)|
| 3:03:21| and that's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| So that's the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| OK, so this failing tonight is not the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| I'm sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11011)|
| 3:03:32| Or this not passing tonight has nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| to do with the will of the board, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| Since it's not five votes, it's not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| Well, so there was a motion presented to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| and it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| So I mean, again, I think we just, or I discussed earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11025)|
| 3:03:49| that the applicant may claim that that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| a proper failure, not a proper denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11031)|
| 3:03:57| But certainly, I think there's more argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11037)|
| 3:04:03| to say that if the board doesn't provide those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11043)|
| 3:04:07| then they'd have an easier time arguing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11047)|
| 3:04:11| that it's not a proper denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| Sure, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11054)|
| 3:04:15| I guess I'm just really confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| because there are a lot of times where the votes will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| go five to four, or whatever, or six to three, and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11060)|
| 3:04:25| And then that's the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| And I get that that's the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| And this is that special case where we are missing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11068)|
| 3:04:32| And I guess I'm just asking for clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| on, does the will of the board even exist in this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11074)|
| 3:04:41| And that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| And that's what they would argue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| is that five members have not weighed in on approve or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11085)|
| 3:04:52| So what was the point in us even voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11092)|
| 3:04:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11098)|
| 3:04:59| I'm hearing noise out in the audience again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| And I have asked a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11102)|
| 3:05:06| now, which I said I wasn't going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11106)|
| 3:05:07| So I'm going to ask one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| But we have to hear each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| That's distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11112)|
| 3:05:13| So we will ask you be escorted out if it continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11113)|
| 3:05:21| I see how it seems in hindsight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| But certainly, even with eight members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| you all could still have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| As of right now, the reality is there isn't five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| I definitely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| But I think that this was a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| that we had at the very beginning of this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| this item, that it seemed like it could go this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11138)|
| 3:05:42| And so it just seems like this was pointless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11142)|
| 3:05:50| Is there a motion that we can move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| Does someone have a motion where we can move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| I have a question that might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| Make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| Well, I think Ms. Henderson's had her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| Oh, I was going to say, yeah, so there's not five votes to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| So you would just make a motion to deny and then vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11167)|
| 3:06:11| No, because we already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11171)|
| 3:06:18| I think that's the only way to end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| Mr. Dupler, I have a complex question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| So looking at 49-13-108, it says that the local board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11188)|
| 3:06:34| of education shall rule by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11194)|
| 3:06:37| So my question, the overarching part of my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11197)|
| 3:06:42| is what does resolution mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11202)|
| 3:06:45| Because when we look at the way county commission, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11205)|
| 3:06:49| when they vote on their agenda, each of their agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| is listed as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| But when we vote, we don't list them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| So is this just a semantic differentiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11220)|
| 3:07:06| that we have actually already ruled by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11226)|
| 3:07:10| because we have voted, because we have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11230)|
| 3:07:16| And then I don't see that it requires us as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11236)|
| 3:07:26| to agree to any list of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11246)|
| 3:07:30| It requires us to give a list of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11250)|
| 3:07:34| It could be our individual list of reasons, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11254)|
| 3:07:46| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11266)|
| 3:07:51| As I stated in the beginning, now that you have a deadlock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11271)|
| 3:07:59| the applicant can certainly argue, and it's a gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| There is no case law stating and interpreting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11282)|
| 3:08:08| this particular section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11288)|
| 3:08:11| So now that you have a denial because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11291)|
| 3:08:18| don't have five votes, it certainly talks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11298)|
| 3:08:22| and I'm just reading it out just as you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| the grounds upon which the local board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| based a decision to deny a public charter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| application must be stated in writing specifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| objective reasons for the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| One could argue that you all have stated those tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11317)|
| 3:08:42| but it's problematic because right now you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11322)|
| 3:08:48| don't have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| May I take it a little bit further in my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| I'm not so much questioning, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| questioning the reasons or that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| What I'm questioning is whether we have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| ruled by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| And looking at a definition of resolution from Cornell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11347)|
| 3:09:13| a resolution is a formal statement of opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11353)|
| 3:09:17| or a decision to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| This board took a vote, which was a formal statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11359)|
| 3:09:25| We all know that the board only takes action through a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11365)|
| 3:09:30| and we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| So we have made a formal statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| We have ruled by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11374)|
| 3:09:39| We did exactly what we were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| I think we are getting tied up in the semantics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| of a resolution as one of those long pieces of paper that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11386)|
| 3:09:50| written out, but that doesn't seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11390)|
| 3:09:54| to be what this means at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11394)|
| 3:09:57| Because through the course of a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| a resolution like that could change significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11401)|
| 3:10:05| But if you are looking at it from a formal statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11405)|
| 3:10:09| we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11409)|
| 3:10:10| We are done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| We can move on from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11412)|
| 3:10:13| I have a point of order, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| I understand what you're saying, but now we have cited reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| and we have voted on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| I'm not talking about the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| I'm talking about that we have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11423)|
| 3:10:28| Right, so that would move forward with that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11428)|
| 3:10:31| What's the point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11431)|
| 3:10:32| I thought I had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11432)|
| 3:10:33| Well, I'm asking Mr. Dupler to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| because we have voted, we have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11436)|
| 3:10:41| determined that that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| And now we are on to the reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| and we have voted on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11447)|
| 3:10:48| And those are two separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| But my point being, one can exist without the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| We can have it as a failure without having reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| Correct, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| I think that's the reality of where this board is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| The board has denied the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| and according to what Ms. Owens is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| in specifically 49-13-108-A-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11470)|
| 3:11:18| But now the question before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| is the grounds called for in A-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| Madam Chair, point of order, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| Mr. Dupler, I believe, and I might be wrong about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11490)|
| 3:11:35| but I believe that generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11495)|
| 3:11:40| according to Robert's rules, that a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11500)|
| 3:11:46| you can vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11506)|
| 3:11:48| But it has to be stated in a positive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11508)|
| 3:11:56| It can't be stated in a negative manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| It has to be stated in a positive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| And you have to have a majority of, if you had 11 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11521)|
| 3:12:11| you'd have to have six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11531)|
| 3:12:14| If you had 13, you'd have to have seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| You have to have a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11537)|
| 3:12:18| Am I wrong about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11538)|
| 3:12:22| No, I don't think you're wrong, but the motion was stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11542)|
| 3:12:29| the original motion was to approve the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11549)|
| 3:12:32| in a positive manner, and it was voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| OK, well then, it was actually voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| or did it just get four to four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11560)|
| 3:12:42| It was four to four, so it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11562)|
| 3:12:45| OK, OK, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| But I still think that it has to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| I don't think that classifies as being voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11571)|
| 3:12:55| What I'm saying is, you have to have a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11575)|
| 3:13:01| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| OK, so we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11582)|
| 3:13:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11590)|
| 3:13:13| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11595)|
| 3:13:16| As a point of order, I believe I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11596)|
| 3:13:17| had the floor this whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11597)|
| 3:13:19| OK, so let me try again, now that it's been all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11599)|
| 3:13:30| Please, Ms. Sullen, continue so we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| I would just like to not play these games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11612)|
| 3:13:41| So in thinking about what the word resolution means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11621)|
| 3:13:48| we're not talking about a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11628)|
| 3:13:51| like our third grade retention resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| I think the board members are thinking we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11633)|
| 3:13:58| But if we're looking at how bodies vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11638)|
| 3:14:05| the nature of what we do is to give our opinion by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11645)|
| 3:14:12| We vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11652)|
| 3:14:13| That's the resolution that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| So going through this process, what we're doing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11656)|
| 3:14:21| is trying to create a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11661)|
| 3:14:25| We already did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11665)|
| 3:14:28| We don't need to create a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| We created the resolution when we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11672)|
| 3:14:38| So now that the resolution exists, all we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11678)|
| 3:14:45| is add into it the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| I don't see anything here that says the board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| to agree to all of those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| We agreed to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11696)|
| 3:14:59| So now all we have to do is attach the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11699)|
| 3:15:04| We shouldn't have to agree on every reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| There is nothing here that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11706)|
| 3:15:09| So when we're saying that these reasons were presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11709)|
| 3:15:12| and the whole board didn't agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11712)|
| 3:15:15| that's really irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| Every member voted based on their own reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11717)|
| 3:15:23| So my reasons are not the same as Ms. Byk's reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11723)|
| 3:15:29| So Ms. Byk and I shouldn't have to vote that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11729)|
| 3:15:32| agree with each other's reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| The reasons have been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| I wish you'd stop rolling your eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| The reasons have been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| The reasons are in the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| Those reasons should be attached to the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11744)|
| 3:15:49| which was created when we took the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11749)|
| 3:16:01| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| I believe Mr. McMillan is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| It's a failure to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| And then we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11765)|
| 3:16:08| That would be the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11768)|
| 3:16:11| You know, I think it has to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11771)|
| 3:16:16| the majority of whatever number is on a given body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11776)|
| 3:16:24| And it has to be stated in a positive vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11784)|
| 3:16:31| So I think we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| But you know, I'm not the law director nor the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11794)|
| 3:16:38| Yeah, I'm tending to agree with you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| You have the power as the chair to rule that we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| All right, so do we have any further motions on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11806)|
| 3:16:51| Ms. Byk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| Is there a current motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| There is, which was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11815)|
| 3:16:56| Can you read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11816)|
| 3:16:58| Ms. Owen made a motion to include in a resolution reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11818)|
| 3:17:02| for denial that have been discussed in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11822)|
| 3:17:05| including discrepancy in financial data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| suspension data, and discrepancy in community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| It was seconded by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| So we need to finish that before we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11832)|
| 3:17:15| So let's do a roll call vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11835)|
| 3:17:19| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11839)|
| 3:17:20| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11842)|
| 3:17:24| Ms. Byk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11844)|
| 3:17:25| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11845)|
| 3:17:26| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11846)|
| 3:17:27| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11849)|
| 3:17:30| That's four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| Any other motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11853)|
| 3:17:33| Now I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| I motion that we include this meeting's minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11855)|
| 3:17:39| as the reasons that we offer up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11859)|
| 3:17:43| And that's what they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11863)|
| 3:17:47| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11867)|
| 3:17:48| So we have a motion by Ms. Byk to offer up the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11868)|
| 3:17:54| to this meeting as our reasons for denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11874)|
| 3:17:57| as seconded by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11877)|
| 3:18:00| Did you have anything else on that, Ms. Byk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| OK, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| OK, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11885)|
| 3:18:06| Did you want the words for denial in your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11886)|
| 3:18:09| Ms. Byk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| You said include this meeting's minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| as the reasons for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11892)|
| 3:18:13| We're saying for denial, but that needs to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11893)|
| 3:18:20| It went four to four, so we need to submit something to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| So this is just the submitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11904)|
| 3:18:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11909)|
| 3:18:30| So can you read that again, Ms. Coatney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| and do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| I believe Ms. Byk's motion was to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| this meeting's minutes as the reasons for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11916)|
| 3:18:40| Was that motion seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11920)|
| 3:18:41| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| Reverend Butler seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11927)|

| 3:18:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11939)|
| 3:18:59| That's four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| So do we have any other motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11942)|
| 3:19:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11946)|
| 3:19:14| I make a motion to begin public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11954)|
| 3:19:15| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11956)|
| 3:19:17| I make a motion to begin public forum and adjourn this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11957)|
| 3:19:24| So Ms. Henderson's made a motion to adjourn discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11964)|
| 3:19:28| on this item and continue with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11968)|
| 3:19:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| No, it doesn't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11976)|
| 3:19:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11979)|
| 3:19:39| So well, I don't see any other lights on anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11979)|
| 3:19:42| So we will adjourn and continue on with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=11982)|

| 3:20:26| to our schools and our kids and for an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12026)|
| 3:20:28| to speak, especially after a very long night for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12028)|
| 3:20:33| I would further like to thank you for proactively putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12033)|

| 3:20:37| and performing an investigation into the procedures he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12037)|
| 3:20:39| followed on March 30 at Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| after the gas leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| The administration's questionable decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12043)|
| 3:20:46| that day, as well as the lack of transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| regarding those decisions, have led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| many to have a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| Our school narrowly avoided being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| another tragic statistic and our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| an unfathomable nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12057)|
| 3:21:00| If protocol was followed, then I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12060)|

| 3:21:14| the board has a huge responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12074)|
| 3:21:15| to look at how we can improve safety and crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12075)|
| 3:21:18| management in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12078)|

| 3:21:25| has become absolutely necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| If these policies are in place and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12088)|
| 3:21:30| weren't exercised at Hardin Valley Academy on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12090)|
| 3:21:34| then we ask, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12094)|
| 3:21:35| Where was the breakdown in communication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12095)|
| 3:21:38| This has shaken the confidence of many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12098)|
| 3:21:40| in our school community, including our children, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12100)|
| 3:21:42| are afraid to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| Furthermore, my daughter has told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| she has never participated in an active shooter drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| She said that they have practiced lockdowns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| for medical emergencies only, to her awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| She sits in school and wonders what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| she will do if a shooter walked into her school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| as I think many of our children have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| had to sit and wonder the same thing, which is completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| different from when we grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12123)|
| 3:22:06| It's time to talk about it, and it's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| to make these kids feel protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| It's time to review our school's procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| and make sure all staff are trained to be strong leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12132)|
| 3:22:15| in times of crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12135)|
| 3:22:16| Our kids deserve it, and they really need this preparedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12136)|
| 3:22:20| To my knowledge, no one in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12140)|
| 3:22:21| called the fire department on March 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| If we can't trust leadership to take seemingly obvious steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| obvious to me anyway, in a situation such as a gas leak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| then how can we trust our school's leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12152)|
| 3:22:33| and other even more dangerous and even sometimes basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12153)|
| 3:22:36| situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12158)|
| 3:22:39| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| Next, we have Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12163)|
| 3:22:44| Courtney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12164)|
| 3:22:48| Welcome, Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| Just state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12170)|
| 3:22:52| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12172)|
| 3:22:58| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12180)|
| 3:23:01| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12181)|
| 3:23:03| In February, I shared my son's story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12183)|
| 3:23:04| with this board in the hopes that we could all work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12184)|
| 3:23:07| to make success for every student accessible to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12187)|
| 3:23:10| with autism by allowing applied behavior analysis or ABA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12190)|
| 3:23:14| therapy in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12194)|
| 3:23:16| Since that time, I've become one of more than 100 parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12196)|
| 3:23:19| who have come together and shared their experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12199)|
| 3:23:22| with Knox County schools and requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12202)|
| 3:23:24| ABA therapy in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| We all have the same shared experience, and it isn't good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12206)|
| 3:23:30| As a reminder, ABA therapy is prescribed by a medical doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12210)|
| 3:23:35| It's the only approved therapy to treat individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12215)|
| 3:23:38| with autism spectrum disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| In February, I shared with you that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12220)|
| 3:23:42| waited more than five months to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| an answer to the question, can my son's therapist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12224)|
| 3:23:47| join him in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| After all, it would cost Knox County schools nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12229)|
| 3:23:52| Our insurance pays for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| It was prescribed by a medical doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| His pre-K allowed it and loved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| But the answer was eventually no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| I also shared with you that over the course of five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12241)|
| 3:24:04| I received inconsistent, conflicting, and at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12244)|
| 3:24:07| false information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12247)|
| 3:24:08| I then pointed out it was a result of systemic failures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| within Knox County schools, one being that the schools do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| have standardized written processes, policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| and procedures for requests such as mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12257)|
| 3:24:20| Since February, our group of more than 100 parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12260)|
| 3:24:23| has looked into this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| So today, I'm presenting a draft policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| for this board's consideration on the May school board agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12266)|
| 3:24:30| that explicitly allows ABA therapy in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12270)|
| 3:24:34| It was emailed to each school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12274)|
| 3:24:36| the superintendent, and the assistant superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| of student success, along with a list of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12279)|
| 3:24:42| used to draft the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12282)|
| 3:24:45| The policy is based on a review of other state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| related to the topic, scientific studies, and other school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12287)|
| 3:24:50| district policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| Fun fact, the state of Louisiana actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| requires this legislatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| And as a lady of all, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| it pains me that another SEC state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| is ahead of us on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| The draft policy provides a clear process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| for autism spectrum disorder students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| to receive medically necessary treatment at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| and redirects the current mindset at KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12310)|
| 3:25:13| which treats ABA therapy as if it were elective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12313)|
| 3:25:17| This costs the school system nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| The therapists are paid for by insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| They do not disrupt the classroom environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12322)|
| 3:25:24| And 23 school districts in East Tennessee already allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12324)|
| 3:25:29| We also emailed Roan County's confidentiality agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12329)|
| 3:25:32| and ABA therapist agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12332)|
| 3:25:34| These are template documents that the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12334)|
| 3:25:36| could easily use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12336)|
| 3:25:38| We've also included a list of citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| which are in the packet that I passed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| I encourage the board to add the policy to the May agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| before the April 12th deadline for agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| so the matter can be publicly discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| Our children cannot wait another school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| to get the support that they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12355)|
| 3:25:58| Thank you, Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| Allison Pasternak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12361)|
| 3:26:09| To state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| Allison Pasternak, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12373)|
| 3:26:16| My son is a seventh grade student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12376)|
| 3:26:17| who was diagnosed with autism spectrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| disorder at five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| He's been receiving ABA therapy services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12381)|
| 3:26:24| for approximately three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12384)|
| 3:26:26| At the present time, KCS will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| allow outside therapists to work with our students in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12388)|
| 3:26:31| So my son must miss school in order to receive his therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| Last year, my son missed 108 full days of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12394)|
| 3:26:38| to participate in his therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12398)|
| 3:26:40| And because KCS is refusing to change this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12400)|
| 3:26:43| or lack thereof a policy, he will have missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12403)|
| 3:26:46| 72 days of school this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| ABA is most effectively done concurrently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12408)|
| 3:26:51| with a patient's daily activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| For a school age child, this means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| ABA is commonly done while at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| This is being done in counties all over Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12417)|
| 3:27:00| Although I have documentation stating that ABA therapy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12420)|
| 3:27:04| medically necessary for my son from three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| independent medical professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| it seems that KCS special education staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| feel that they are more qualified than my physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12432)|
| 3:27:17| to follow these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| After years of being told KCS doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| allow outside therapists to work in their schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| I felt I was making progress when my son's BCBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12443)|
| 3:27:26| when I was told my son's BCBA could observe him at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12446)|
| 3:27:30| A few weeks ago, my son's BCBA and the KCS behavior liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| agreed to meet for a period of two hours to observe my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| Unfortunately, the KCS liaison ended the observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12457)|
| 3:27:40| 30 minutes early with no explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12460)|
| 3:27:43| During this observation, the KCS liaison did not take notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| did not collect data, and he even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| asked my son's BCBA why she was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12468)|
| 3:27:51| and for what purpose she was conducting this observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12471)|
| 3:27:55| When my son's BCBA arrived to conduct the observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12475)|
| 3:27:57| she was introduced to a woman who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12477)|
| 3:27:59| was identified as my son's aide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| This woman was not my son's aide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| In fact, she is not an aide at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| She was a restorative interventionist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12487)|
| 3:28:08| While a KCS special education supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| said this person was filling in due to staff absences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| my son's BCBA was led to believe this woman is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12493)|
| 3:28:16| an aide who works for him every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| While the KCS supervisor insists that no deception was intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| it feels as though honesty and transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| were also not intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| When I've asked about the process of getting permissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| for my son's therapist to work with him at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| I've been told the process is different for every child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12512)|
| 3:28:35| What turns out is not different is all these children's parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12515)|
| 3:28:38| have been met with similar roadblocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12518)|
| 3:28:40| when trying to get therapy in the school for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12520)|
| 3:28:45| I'm not asking Knox County to hire a team of therapists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| to work with my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| I'm not asking KCS to pay for this therapy my son receives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12529)|
| 3:28:52| My son's insurance pays for his therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| regardless of where it is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12534)|
| 3:28:56| I'm asking KCS to open the doors for my child's therapist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| to work with him at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| If success for every student is truly a motto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| this superintendent stands by, KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| must adopt a policy that allows our children to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12546)|
| 3:29:09| ABA therapy services at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12551)|

| 3:29:33| As we stand here, again, asking for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| again this month in getting our children the ABA services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12575)|
| 3:29:38| they need, I ask, why is this such a fight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12578)|
| 3:29:42| Why are our children continuing to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| treated as second class citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12584)|
| 3:29:47| Why do the citizens of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12587)|
| 3:29:48| have to continuously keep paying lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12588)|
| 3:29:51| that the school district continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| to lose for violating our children's rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| My son is in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12597)|
| 3:29:58| And since school started, he goes to school eight hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| a day without eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12601)|
| 3:30:04| His GI saw him two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12604)|
| 3:30:06| And in six months, he's went from the 95th percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| in weight to the 17th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12609)|
| 3:30:12| We are now having to consider feeding tubes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12612)|
| 3:30:14| if this is not resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| His ABA therapist and team can be there with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12616)|
| 3:30:19| We've been denied access as parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| to observe to help with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| Our ABA team has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| He's been a victim of bullying because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12625)|
| 3:30:28| has social and emotional cognitive development delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12628)|
| 3:30:32| and communication delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12632)|
| 3:30:34| He cannot tell the teacher what is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12634)|
| 3:30:38| This other kid also has behavior concerns if he's bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| This has been a process that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| happening since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| Our very own special education director, Dr. Karen Lowy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12646)|
| 3:30:50| has compared ABA therapy to karate and piano lessons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12650)|
| 3:30:55| in a written statement to a parent of a special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12655)|
| 3:30:58| child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12658)|
| 3:30:59| If she's the director of our services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| what does that say that she's putting forth about our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12661)|
| 3:31:06| Where do they mean to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12666)|
| 3:31:08| And she's the director of our services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| Why is this such a fight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12671)|
| 3:31:15| Mr. Myers, in a statement back to the Bearden Bark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12675)|
| 3:31:19| said that when we make decisions as a school leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12679)|
| 3:31:22| it needs to be of students that should always be the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12682)|
| 3:31:27| If all of our students are the priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| then why are our students continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12689)|
| 3:31:32| the ones getting pushed aside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| We've listened tonight for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12694)|
| 3:31:37| You guys have had to deliberate and take in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| about the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| Not one time has anybody recognized the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12701)|
| 3:31:44| that it is April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12704)|
| 3:31:45| It's Autism Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12705)|
| 3:31:48| No one has recognized our kids in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12708)|
| 3:31:50| Not one school, not one member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12710)|
| 3:31:53| And the charter school doesn't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| recognize special education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12715)|
| 3:31:58| So what do our kids mean to this school district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12718)|
| 3:32:02| When is enough enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| When are our kids going to get what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12724)|
| 3:32:06| they need without us having to fight through hoops daily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12726)|
| 3:32:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12733)|

| 3:32:18| Is Christina here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12738)|
| 3:32:30| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12750)|
| 3:32:31| Just state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| Hi, my name's Christina Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12755)|
| 3:32:36| I'm Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12756)|
| 3:32:38| And I'm here tonight because of a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12758)|
| 3:32:42| that happened last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12762)|
| 3:32:44| I'm sure you've heard a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12764)|
| 3:32:45| I'm just going to go ahead and tell you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| I hate public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12767)|
| 3:32:51| I don't know a lot of you people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| and you certainly don't know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| I don't get very involved in local politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| although I appreciate everything you do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12777)|
| 3:33:01| And this is the very first time I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| been to a school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12783)|
| 3:33:06| So what got me here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12786)|
| 3:33:08| I'm here because last Thursday, we narrowly escaped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12788)|
| 3:33:13| a mass casualty incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12793)|
| 3:33:16| Some people say that's dramatic, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12800)|
| 3:33:20| 2,100 students in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12800)|
| 3:33:25| It started out as a fairly normal morning for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12805)|
| 3:33:29| I have a child there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12809)|
| 3:33:30| She's a sophomore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| And I started to get some texts from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12812)|
| 3:33:34| I know a lot of you that have kids know what that's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12814)|
| 3:33:37| I'm at work, and she's just texting away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| Hey, mom, it smells in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12819)|
| 3:33:40| There's something going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12820)|
| 3:33:42| I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12822)|
| 3:33:43| OK, now they're saying it's a gas leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12823)|
| 3:33:46| My French teacher took us outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12826)|
| 3:33:49| because it was burning our eyes and our throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| And I thought, OK, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| And she said, yeah, they said they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12834)|
| 3:33:57| going to call some people out and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12837)|
| 3:34:00| And I kept thinking, OK, well, they've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12840)|
| 3:34:03| School leadership's got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| And I told her, I said, it's going to be OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12845)|
| 3:34:10| Calm down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12850)|
| 3:34:12| You can trust that they're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12852)|
| 3:34:16| This went on until about 940 that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12856)|
| 3:34:20| And the hair on the back of my neck started to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12860)|
| 3:34:25| And I thought, trust but verify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| I called my husband, who has contacts with the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| department, and I said, hey, wouldn't they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| call the fire department out if there was a gas leak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12873)|
| 3:34:36| And he said, yeah, that's usually what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12876)|
| 3:34:38| And I said, why don't you call the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12878)|
| 3:34:40| to see if they're on site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12880)|
| 3:34:43| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| He called me back, and he said, nothing has been called in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12885)|
| 3:34:49| but they are in route now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12889)|
| 3:34:53| I told my daughter to trust the leadership of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12893)|
| 3:35:01| And that haunts me, because had I not listened to my instincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12901)|
| 3:35:05| we might have had a much bigger problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12905)|
| 3:35:08| It is by the grace of God that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| didn't lose anybody that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12910)|
| 3:35:18| I have a couple of asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| The first one, you guys have already handled for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12920)|
| 3:35:26| Having an interim leadership person in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12926)|
| 3:35:31| we needed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12931)|
| 3:35:32| Now let's focus on safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12932)|
| 3:35:34| Let's get the policies, the procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12934)|
| 3:35:36| and the consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12936)|
| 3:35:38| That's all I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12938)|
| 3:35:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| Jenna Bella?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| I'm so sorry if I butchered your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| Jenna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| She couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12949)|
| 3:35:50| Oh, OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12950)|
| 3:35:52| Jennifer Pettyjohn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12952)|
| 3:35:57| Welcome, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| Just state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12961)|
| 3:36:04| I'm Jennifer Pettyjohn from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12964)|
| 3:36:07| Thank you all for allowing us the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| I'm a parent of both a Hardin Valley graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12971)|
| 3:36:14| and a Hardin Valley current student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12974)|
| 3:36:16| I have experienced so many changes in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12976)|
| 3:36:19| Most importantly, the lack of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12979)|
| 3:36:22| for our growing enrollment and a lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12982)|
| 3:36:24| of transparent communication with students and parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12984)|
| 3:36:28| The school has a lack of mental health resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12988)|
| 3:36:31| for a generation of students who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| faced unimaginable pressures, unprecedented world politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12993)|
| 3:36:37| and world health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12997)|
| 3:36:39| This school has a lack of security on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=12999)|
| 3:36:42| And more often than not, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13002)|
| 3:36:44| a lack of staff and substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13004)|
| 3:36:47| This lack of resources has resulted in increased chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13007)|
| 3:36:50| Students fighting, expensive and repeated vandalism, fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13010)|
| 3:36:55| smoke alarms, protests, and threats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| most of which parents learn about after the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13017)|
| 3:37:00| from their students or social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| The lack of communication, transparency, and consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13023)|
| 3:37:06| has resulted in a nearly daily crisis situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13026)|
| 3:37:10| in the past week and a pattern of inaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13030)|
| 3:37:13| by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| Many of us have asked very specific questions of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13035)|
| 3:37:18| of you, the administration, our local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| regarding the handling of the March 30th incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13042)|
| 3:37:25| and recent threats of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13045)|
| 3:37:26| We have yet to receive those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13046)|
| 3:37:29| I have confidence the authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| will handle the criminal investigation of Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| Kosterman's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| Our questions have no bearing on that criminal investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13055)|
| 3:37:38| But the lack of transparency and lack of response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| is contributing to a lack of confidence in our school's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13060)|
| 3:37:43| safety, fueling rumors on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13063)|
| 3:37:46| and creating unnecessary divides among parents, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| students in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| What are the school and district policies regarding a gas leak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13072)|
| 3:37:55| Were they followed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13075)|
| 3:37:56| Did the school call the fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| We know now it was apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| When did they arrive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13081)|
| 3:38:02| What did they advise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13082)|
| 3:38:03| Were their recommendations followed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13083)|
| 3:38:06| What were the gas level readings within the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13086)|
| 3:38:08| upon arrival and when students were dismissed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13088)|
| 3:38:11| We are entitled to know exactly what level of gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13091)|
| 3:38:14| our students were exposed to and for how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13094)|
| 3:38:18| Did the school district have a current background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13098)|
| 3:38:20| on the custodian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13100)|
| 3:38:22| When was the most recent key audit done at Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13102)|
| 3:38:25| Are all those keys accounted for since his dismissal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13105)|
| 3:38:29| You have a responsibility to curb the assumptions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| are being made and get us answers to these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13112)|
| 3:38:35| through a full and transparent third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13115)|
| 3:38:38| investigation into the school's response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| and not an investigation led by the very administration that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13121)|
| 3:38:45| allowed it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| The findings of that third party investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| need to be communicated to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13129)|
| 3:38:52| and corrective actions need to be taken so that our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13132)|
| 3:38:55| can return to school with the confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| that their safety is the top priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13137)|
| 3:38:59| of this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| Thank you for your time and your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13141)|
| 3:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13144)|
| 3:39:06| Anthony Parker, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13146)|
| 3:39:12| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13152)|
| 3:39:14| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13154)|
| 3:39:14| Most of y'all read my emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13154)|
| 3:39:16| There'll be more coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13156)|
| 3:39:19| Anthony Parker, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13159)|
| 3:39:22| I had a whole theme in what I was going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13162)|
| 3:39:25| But there's been a theme that's come up since I started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| So I'm going to change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13167)|
| 3:39:28| So bear with me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13168)|
| 3:39:29| I'm not as prepared because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| I've heard half a dozen, a dozen parents come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13171)|
| 3:39:35| Varying issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13175)|
| 3:39:36| I mean, there's two in particular we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13176)|
| 3:39:38| But a common theme, even though they're very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13178)|
| 3:39:40| Policy and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13180)|
| 3:39:42| I've been asking since this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13182)|
| 3:39:44| All of this is related to Hardin Valley, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13184)|
| 3:39:46| Policy and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13186)|
| 3:39:48| What were the policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13188)|
| 3:39:49| that happened that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| Were they followed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13191)|
| 3:39:52| Are they the best policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13192)|
| 3:39:53| Things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13193)|
| 3:39:54| My car does not run the same way the car I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13194)|
| 3:39:57| that I owned 10 years ago did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| Have those policies been updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13199)|
| 3:40:01| The other question is, we had a gas leak this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| at Northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13203)|
| 3:40:04| It was handled very differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13204)|
| 3:40:05| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| I'm going to go through a couple things that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| And I'm going to speak factually because I was involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13209)|
| 3:40:12| But my ask for the school board, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13212)|
| 3:40:14| going to go ahead and ask you about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13214)|
| 3:40:15| is an independent audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13215)|
| 3:40:17| Let's go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13217)|
| 3:40:18| Let's transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13218)|
| 3:40:19| Let's fix the policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13219)|
| 3:40:21| Not just this, but these poor parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| that have been here, that have been dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13223)|
| 3:40:24| with this for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13224)|
| 3:40:26| Fix the policies and address them and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13226)|
| 3:40:28| That's what every one of us elected you guys to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| And then you took your ability and you appointed Dr. Roswin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13231)|
| 3:40:36| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13236)|
| 3:40:39| I want crisis management taught to every principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13239)|
| 3:40:42| They need to follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13242)|
| 3:40:43| They need to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13243)|
| 3:40:44| When I went to the school, it looked like Beirut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13244)|
| 3:40:47| I've been in a management situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| where I had to manage a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13249)|
| 3:40:51| That was scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13251)|
| 3:40:53| And it was pathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13253)|
| 3:40:54| It was a bad experience on the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13254)|
| 3:40:57| So I'm going to give you a quick timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13257)|
| 3:40:59| so you know how that day went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| From the person that was there, that came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13261)|
| 3:41:03| I dropped my daughter off at that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| About 8.30 or so, the emails came out and I watched them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13266)|
| 3:41:09| Like my wife that spoke a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13269)|
| 3:41:12| I trusted the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13272)|
| 3:41:13| That was our mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13273)|
| 3:41:16| And we'll be more involved in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13276)|
| 3:41:18| to make sure that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13278)|
| 3:41:20| At 9.30-ish, my wife texted me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| why don't you reach out to the school board or the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| department and find out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| I contacted the fire department directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| I confirmed that no one from the school system had called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13287)|
| 3:41:32| We'll get into more information related to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| if there's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| Quickly, they dispatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| At 10.30-ish, they recommended that the school be evacuated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13297)|
| 3:41:41| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13301)|
| 3:41:42| I've seen the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13302)|
| 3:41:44| I was told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13304)|
| 3:41:44| It did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13304)|
| 3:41:46| At 11.15 is when I picked up my daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13306)|
| 3:41:48| and that's when it looked like Beirut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13308)|
| 3:41:50| I couldn't go out the normal ramp through the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13310)|
| 3:41:52| so I drove around the building, out the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| There was one maintenance vehicle, one door open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| and they were not following NFPA guidelines for getting gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13318)|
| 3:42:04| out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13324)|
| 3:42:05| How do I know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13325)|
| 3:42:06| Because I've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13326)|
| 3:42:08| Lastly, with my last 12 seconds, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13328)|
| 3:42:11| a member of the Karnes Fire Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| I may not be on it because I've made this statement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| You need to look at how many times the principal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13335)|
| 3:42:18| was there has refused to allow assistance from the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13338)|
| 3:42:21| department and its public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13341)|
| 3:42:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13345)|
| 3:42:28| Our last speaker, Amanda Donson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13348)|
| 3:42:30| Amanda, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13350)|
| 3:42:33| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13354)|
| 3:42:36| Just state your name, county residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13356)|
| 3:42:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13358)|
| 3:42:39| I'm Amanda Donson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13359)|
| 3:42:40| I am a Knox County resident, and I'm also a special ed teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13360)|
| 3:42:44| at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13364)|
| 3:42:45| Thanks, guys, so much for being here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13365)|
| 3:42:48| for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13368)|
| 3:42:50| I'm here on behalf of myself tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| and several teachers at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13372)|
| 3:42:55| I, too, was at Hardin Valley Academy on March 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13375)|
| 3:43:00| I want to thank all the board members and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13380)|
| 3:43:03| our district six representative for all of the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13383)|
| 3:43:06| that you all have attempted to support us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13386)|
| 3:43:09| as staff over this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13389)|
| 3:43:11| It's really not an easy time to be in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| in any capacity right now, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13395)|
| 3:43:17| we all have unique challenges in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13397)|
| 3:43:21| when we're trying to support each other so we can best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| support our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| That said, I am disappointed in district leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| and communication and how teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| were notified about an administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| shift at our school that will begin next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13413)|
| 3:43:36| We were alerted via Parent Square yesterday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13416)|
| 3:43:39| and the information was sparse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13419)|
| 3:43:41| I'm completely aware there are often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13421)|
| 3:43:44| issues beyond control that don't allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13424)|
| 3:43:47| for complete and swift communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| but the lack of support and guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| that teachers felt yesterday and today was heartbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13432)|
| 3:43:56| I would like to thank our HVA assistant principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13436)|
| 3:43:59| and how they attempted to lead us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13439)|
| 3:44:02| but we are all hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13442)|
| 3:44:03| As we know, lack of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| breeds chaos, rumors, anxiety, and hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13445)|
| 3:44:09| I'm saddened that the actions of so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| have led to Hardin Valley parents, students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13451)|
| 3:44:13| and teachers feel that this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13453)|
| 3:44:16| I'd also like to thank our region two director, Nathan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13456)|
| 3:44:18| Langlois, who held a staff meeting this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13458)|
| 3:44:22| with my co-workers and administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13462)|
| 3:44:24| in which tensions were high and tears were shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13464)|
| 3:44:28| He's an incredibly kind person who was there to listen for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13468)|
| 3:44:32| and has been at our school all week, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| But he has made it clear that he has no grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13475)|
| 3:44:38| to truly support us further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13478)|
| 3:44:41| It was also mentioned earlier, like four hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| that other district leaders had visited us to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13484)|
| 3:44:47| our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13487)|
| 3:44:48| And while I did see many members of the KCS executive team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13488)|
| 3:44:52| at HVA this week, teachers' concerns or voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13492)|
| 3:44:55| were not asked for nor shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13495)|
| 3:44:58| How can our teachers be most effective to our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13498)|
| 3:45:01| we love when we are left to pick up the pieces after chaos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13501)|
| 3:45:04| due to lack of information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| I hope for more clear and honest communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13506)|
| 3:45:09| in the near future as events continue to unfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13509)|
| 3:45:12| And I hope that Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13512)|
| 3:45:14| can continue doing the work to be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13514)|
| 3:45:16| than ever for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13516)|
| 3:45:18| As a teacher, Dr. Spies has nothing but my utmost support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13518)|
| 3:45:22| trust, and respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13522)|
| 3:45:24| And I believe he is the most equipped leader for Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13524)|
| 3:45:26| Valley Academy, including everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13526)|
| 3:45:30| that happened on March 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13530)|
| 3:45:32| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13532)|
| 3:45:33| Go Hawks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13533)|
| 3:45:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13534)|
| 3:45:35| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13535)|
| 3:45:40| All right, with that, the meeting is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13540)|
| 3:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230406?start=13542)|
