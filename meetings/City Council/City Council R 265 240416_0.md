| 0:00:55| and we mourn with them the passing of Kylie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| We're reminded about the sorrows of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| and the importance of treating one another with care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| Please allow us to make improvements for our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| not for the sake of pride or ambition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| but because we care for one another as humans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=71)|
| 0:01:14| and want the best quality of life possible for everyone we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=74)|

| 0:01:26| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=86)|

| 0:02:27| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I would like to make a motion to postpone items 10A and 10B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| particularly item 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| The neighborhood and the applicant would like some time to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| But, again, to repeat, I would make a motion to postpone items 10A and 10B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| for two weeks. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=162)|

| 0:02:52| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| Okay, are there any other items to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| Are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| Is there a consent item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| No. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Oh, yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| I would like to make a motion to add items to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Items 9A, C, and D, I would like to make a motion to add to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=205)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Vice Mayor Smith has made a motion to move items 9A, C, and D to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| Yes, I was actually going to say this during my council report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| but it was brought to my attention that four weeks ago we put something on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=233)|
| 0:04:03| that had someone signed up to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| And my understanding was that we do have, as a part of our city council rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=247)|
| 0:04:21| you know, it's written that items on second reading can be added to the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=261)|
| 0:04:30| but we've had kind of informal conversations about not adding items to the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| that have individuals signed up to speak to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| And so I just wanted to let you all know that I'm no longer supporting that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| I would support us continuing a conversation about our current rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| and whether we want to return to them, because if we do follow the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| then what is on consent will be noticed to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| As we are operating currently, as what happened four weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| someone signed up to speak to an agenda item and couldn't get into the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| to alert us to the fact that they wanted to speak to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| And so there's no notice to them that we are on a weekly or on every meeting basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| now committed to adding these items to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| So I'm not able to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Council members, it requires a unanimous vote to move things from the regular agenda to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=335)|
| 0:05:42| So this is not unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| So I guess we'll move on with the agenda as published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Any other questions or discussion before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| It's time now for my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| And as most of you know, as everybody knows, we are here tonight with very heavy hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| Sunday night, Councilman Andrew Roberto's daughter, Kylie, was killed in a head-on crash in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=371)|
| 0:06:20| We are all heartbroken and shocked by this tragic news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| As a mom, I can't imagine what he's going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| And I know that it's affected all the people who knew and loved Kylie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| So we just want to keep Andrew and his family in our prayers and in our thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| and lift them up in whatever way we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| while also acknowledging that they need privacy to mourn during this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| as they come to grips with what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| And he will certainly let us know when arrangements have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| so we can support the family by attending the service if we wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| So if we could have a moment of silence to remember Kylie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| and keep Andrew and his family in our thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=428)|
| 0:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And now I want to review our rules of decorum, which I share at the beginning of every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| So a quick reminder for those who wish to speak, either to a specific agenda item or during public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| need to sign up with the city recorder ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Please do not use profanity, and when speaking to specific agenda items, please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| Council's rules state that remarks must be germane to the question before the assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| This is according to Robert's rules, which Council has decided to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| So remarks must be germane to the question before the assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| which means statements must have a bearing on whether the pending motion should be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| Those who fail to adhere to Council's rules will be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| For those who are listening, please note you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| Thank you in advance for everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| That concludes my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Any reports from Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Seeing none, we will move on with the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Ms. Hopper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Well, we'll fix the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| It's not functioning as we hoped, but we're going to move on anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| So we're on item 8A, elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Item 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Officer Leslie Presley to the Record Services Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240416?start=541)|
