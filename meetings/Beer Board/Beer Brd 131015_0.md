| 0:03:49| Hunter miss Harris indicated on her owner manager application on question number nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| that she does have a prior conviction aside from that one conviction listed on the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| manager application there were six other convictions that were not disclosed on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| okay Mr. Frost would you like to explain to us the next step thank you chair as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=245)|
| 0:04:18| of the beer application process as members of the beer board is where you're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| to disclose a number of things one of which is if you've had look for the right words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=264)|
| 0:04:34| conviction of different laws and she being miss Harris did disclose a two thousand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=274)|
| 0:04:49| eight issue but in discussing other issues with Sergeant Hunter there have been a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=289)|
| 0:04:58| of things that were not disclosed which the council or excuse me the beer board may determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| does not make her eligible to be the manager on a beer applicant beer application there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=306)|
| 0:05:15| as I see it there are three different routes that are possible one would be to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| and approve despite the failure to disclose another could be denial which would result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=323)|
| 0:05:32| in Chipotle starting the process again and the third option could be a postponement until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| Chipotle has a manager applicant that would qualify under the beer ordinances okay so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=340)|
| 0:05:51| you understand that there are three options the beer board will look at tonight Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| Hunter you've talked about the records this dire what about the file fire prevention approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| is all the file X okay vice mayor Pavlis did you have a question well I do I mean the convictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| would they preclude her from being I mean with a well the convictions as far as I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| aware Sergeant Hunter can certainly jump in didn't pertain to alcohol there are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=375)|
| 0:06:23| convictions that exclude people from being on applications in this situation it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=383)|
| 0:06:35| failure to disclose issue and whether or not the beer board determines that is grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=395)|
| 0:06:44| denied or not okay Mr. Walt Councilman wall it's the best thing to have a second Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=404)|
| 0:06:58| ribbit after you do Councilman crease there's a motion on the floor I mean for you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| to make a comment before we vote on that motion well I was going to I was going to ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| question that what's the difference between number two and number three you said Chipotle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| could either start over or we could postpone till they get another manager what's the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| between the two well Chipotle being denied I guess they would have to go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| whole process again pay the fees go through all the background checks and everything whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| it would just have to find a applicant as a manager that would fulfill the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=448)|
| 0:07:40| we've had this situation recently where we had a manager who did not correctly or truthfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| answer the application questions and we gave that particular business 30 days to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| new manager they came back and got their their permit at the next meeting so that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| that's what this third option of postponing would entail okay Councilman Della vote before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| we vote go ahead thank you I was going to ask oh you still got one I'm sorry only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| question in my district I would like to have a few comments I don't have any problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| postponing but I really want to stress the fact that I think the beer board should make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| it emphatic that these businesses that are coming before us they need to also check the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| people out that they're going to have his manager and if if they end up presenting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| us a person that they don't know about you know I'm really sorry about that but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| we just need to make it clear that in this particular situation we can postpone but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| think it's pretty serious that if an applicant comes to us and doesn't know about their manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| or has not checked him out themselves but anyway I'll second his motion we'll put this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| on the list of topics for November 21st we'll be here about eight hours so plan accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| Councilman Della vote thank you chairman I was just going to ask the folks from Chipotle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| did you understand the dialogue that's been going back and forth that if we postpone you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| have the option of using a different manager who qualifies and are you willing to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| oh yeah I mean I have two other managers that I could do but we were under the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| that it was anything within the last five years it's the last 10 years sir okay we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| it was five I'm sorry in addition to that this is not this would not be a reason to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| deny miss Harris but she owes almost sixty three hundred dollars worth of outstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| fines to the city and that's something that from my perspective makes me wonder how responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| she would be in sales to minors and other things and I know Chipotle is a well-known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| chain you've got a great reputation and I'm miss Harris probably had some problems in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| her past but you need to come in here with a clean foot and we'll all probably go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| sooner or later yeah I have a I have two other managers that I can put up for it okay then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=594)|

| 0:17:17| a shopping center a little strip center that's been recently renovated tienda has been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| for about eight years I think 12 years and the previous owner was Alibaba and I think most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1043)|
| 0:17:30| us have probably eaten there and they he did not allow alcohol to be sold or served at any of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| properties the property has now changed hands the new owners don't seem to have that restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| so the end of applied for the permit however the new owner has leased the bottom part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1062)|
| 0:17:50| building to awaken Church and the measurement was 40 feet and we have to have 50 feet by law so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1070)|
| 0:18:01| called today engineering and I asked him to go back out and measure it as many different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| as they could and it was not even good it was the news was not nearly as good as 40 feet so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| to a permit to you we will vote on this but we cannot do that because you are too close to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1092)|
| 0:18:22| church now I will say this if that church moves out and you act again before somebody else moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| in we have a new ballgame but right now the law says that for off-premise 50 feet and you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| meet that requirement me okay may we add a little bit of information just because the we printed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1116)|
| 0:18:44| these this is the layout of the shopping center right here there is no access to the church the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| church is on a lower level in the back of the shopping center right there's no access between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| the walls through here only going around through a stairwell and we measured in his 338 feet okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| it doesn't matter whether there's a stairwell or access and actually he got into the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| today because it was open and he measured and the way the the and the church comes in under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| your store at an angle and it was actually less than 40 feet when he got to that part of it so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| I'm very disappointed for you because I know you've had a successful business there do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| to vote on this but the only way to okay yes I mean it's like our bathroom with their ceiling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1165)|
| 0:19:42| you know what I'm saying yeah I under I understand completely but we have they've only been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| once a week they're not even our customers you have our sympathy but I'm sure what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1188)|
| 0:19:59| mr. Frost do you want to help us out sure thank you chairman last week the distance issue was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| brought to my attention they are seeking an off-premise permit which as we've heard as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| 50-foot distance requirement you know as part of section 4-66 we have what I call the liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| license exception but unfortunately the liquor license exception does not apply to the type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| permit that they are seeking the code specifically says that when you're measuring you measure by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| the shortest distance so I certainly understand and sympathize with the owners of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1235)|
| 0:20:43| of where they think one measurement is available but the code actually actually specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| requires the shortest distance measurement I would try to find out if grandfathering was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1250)|
| 0:21:00| available to them before the church they're there before the church but they did not they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| have a beer permit before the church that would grandfather them so unfortunately in reading the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| code I'm not well certain that there's nothing that the beer board can do in terms of granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1271)|
| 0:21:20| them a permit councilman stare you look like you have a comment or well I guess my only question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| is does it is it and I don't even know if this is the case but if the church is just renting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| and if the property is taxed as commercial property all that is irrelevant that was good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| though all right we have two options we can have a motion with no second we cannot have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1298)|
| 0:21:54| so do I hear a motion I have a question yes sir I would I was wondering if there was any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| opportunity for you to go back and meet with your landlord and see if he can adjust the rental space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| of the church so you get the proper distance I don't know whether there's some walls there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| he could pick a different end point of the church so that you would have the 450 feet if that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| true we could postpone it until you tried that but that's probably iffy that is probably iffy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| um the other there's another option too that the church doesn't pay their rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| they won't be there so they need to we can pray for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| they'll need a bigger space than that sooner or later I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| okay so we've asked for a motion I'm sorry Mr. Wallace that's what I would say I would postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| it see if y'all want to postpone it for 30 I was gonna ask you about the application fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| would we lose the application fee or if we postpone it is that still on hold for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| reapply yes the application fee is good until we say you you know we deny or whatever so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| we could postpone the next meeting is November 26th and the one after that December 19th so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| we could postpone to the November 26th meeting with the approval of council and then that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| give you an opportunity to talk to the church to see if maybe they would not object and your sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| and their time of worship we can't waive it can't do that well never mind I didn't say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| madam chair you need to find 10 extra feet yes I'd like to make a motion that we postpone for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1407)|

| 0:28:07| something that sort of is an external aid to making the right mathematical judgment I didn't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| you had anything that you either posted a cutoff date or something like that or we do we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| machine that something looks at I mean I didn't know what what else you did other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| I'll let Mark comment in addition that Mark Mark's been with us she's he's been in business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| for over 20 years managing um we post the date daily on a sign-in sheet with all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| bartender servers everything and that's changed on a daily basis with each day that changes so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| they have a reference point when they look at those things and they're required to sign it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| at the beginning of their shift we've also put multiple policies in effect as far as every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| individual in the building must show proper identification regardless of age and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| our policy and then we on the plan we listed all the new steps that right okay okay I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1736)|
| 0:29:05| move that we have some people who want to make some comments um Councilman Wallace and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| Vice Mayor Pavlis when was the first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1751)|

| 0:29:21| Okay so almost two years between all right Vice Mayor Pavlis I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| comment on I like the fact that you didn't if I understood you correctly did not let the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| go didn't fire them because in your business I mean they can in five minutes ten minutes be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| working at another bar and restaurant and just like that and they haven't been trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| and I appreciate the extra steps to train them rather than fire them and let them go untrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| so I think that's the right way I mean obviously if it's a repeat offender then obviously you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131015?start=1791)|
