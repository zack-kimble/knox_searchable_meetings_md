| 0:17:45| and the neighbors appealed, and to me it was a clear-cut error below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| But we could have just denied, we could have upheld the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| but what we were able to do, being flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| we were able to approve the project conditioned on the developer submitting a stormwater plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| and letting the neighbors comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| That was really all they were entitled to do, is have a plan out there and be able to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| So we handled it in one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| It did not take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Importantly, it gave the citizens their voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| It let them be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Citizens sometimes go to Planning Commission and they feel they're not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| So if you do away with that easy appeal to BZA, if you make them go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| first of all, you're going to price citizens out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| They're going to feel they're not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| They're going to feel they're being priced out of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| I think it would be a drastic step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| It would be a drastic step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| And I don't know what the rationale for this proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| I heard it perhaps was just a matter of administrative burden on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| But if that's the case, and I would point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| one lawsuit would wipe out way any savings that the county might have saved by avoiding BZA actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1147)|
| 0:19:18| And, again, the citizens need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| If they feel they have to go to court, by God, some of them will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| And then you'll just have more burdens on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| I was on BZA for several years, and I don't recall any – we had a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| To me, it was not an excessive number of appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| I did not think any of them were frivolous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| I thought several of them had clear-cut justification, just like the one I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| Again, I don't know what the rationale is, but if you feel there are frivolous appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| perhaps you could consider a less drastic step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Perhaps you need to raise the appeal, the fee to appeal to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| It's, what, $200 or $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| If you think people will pay that frivolously, maybe you need to raise that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| I will reserve my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Again, I don't know what the rationale was, but if there's any discussion, I would like to be able to reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Yes, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| When did you start on BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| I don't recall the exact – I got off about two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| I think it must have been from early 2012 to 2018, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Do you remember the year of the case that you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I do not remember the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| It was toward the end of, I don't know, maybe 2016 in there, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Madam Clerk, if you'll please read Item 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| It's Resolution R-22-5-903, requesting the Knox County Planning Commission to recommend amendments to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1255)|
| 0:21:05| Knox County Zoning Ordinance to provide for use on review appeals to a court of competent jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Mr. Smith, you're last still on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Like Mr. Thompson, I had the opportunity before serving on commission to serve on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1293)|
| 0:21:42| In fact, Commissioner Daley and I were the inaugural class of citizens who replaced county commissioners on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1302)|
| 0:21:53| And I served until – I guess it was – well, actually until I got on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1313)|
| 0:22:01| In other words, from 2009 to 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| In that time period, there was not an excessive amount of these type of appeals that would have bogged down the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1324)|
| 0:22:18| We had a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| I do agree with the speaker in that you're taking what is considered a very, very reasonable cost on the part of a citizen of Knox County to appeal a decision made by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1341)|
| 0:22:39| Since getting a copy of this last-minute edition, I did reach out to an attorney in town that handles a lot of cases before the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1359)|
| 0:22:55| And he was kind of surprised at the direction this was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| And so I asked just ballpark figures, what would this cost the average citizen now to go from the $200 fee that he currently pays at BZA to go to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1382)|
| 0:23:15| And his reaction was, to find a competent attorney that's going to do this, you're now looking in the neighborhood of around $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1395)|
| 0:23:25| So I think that this body needs to look at this issue very closely when you take an existing right of a citizen away from them to appeal this at a reasonable cost to now make them go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1405)|
| 0:23:46| where courts are not exactly – they're a little bit backlogged right now as well, where you can't just get in and get a quick one and over and done with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| Yes, I have a question about that of our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker said there's a great cost for a citizen to appeal this to Chancery Court. What is that fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| An appeal out of something from the Planning Commission is $259.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| And does one have to – an individual have to have a lawyer to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| And during that process, is there a lawyer needed to do dispositions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Present evidence to the judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| It's kind of summary judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| All that goes before the judge is exactly the record, the documents that were before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1478)|
| 0:24:46| The Planning Commission just sends them up, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| And then the judge looks at that, he hears argument from both sides on whether or not the Planning Commission followed the law or whether they are arbitrary and capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1490)|
| 0:25:01| That's the sole basis that the judge can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| So, it's basically a $275 fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| $259.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| So, it's $59 more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| $259.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| $59 more than an appeal to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| And there's no need for an individual to have a lawyer to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| That was actually my question with Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Schoolmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| I just wanted to make sure it wasn't going to cost any additional – making sure that you don't have to have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| But I am wondering how long would the timing take versus going to BZA and then waiting to go to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| Does that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Generally, those things go – cert actions go to the top of the dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| That's number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Number two, you've got to look at the fact that if somebody was upset with the finding of the BZA, they've still got to take it up to a chance to record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1549)|
| 0:25:58| So, that's adding another step in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| This thing, the way I see it, is taking out that step because otherwise it's a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| Commissioner Smith, who would be making this decision, staff or the 15 commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| Which decision are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| For use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| This is for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Staff makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| MPC commission, my understanding, makes a determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| I see you hiding back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1601)|
| 0:26:49| Amy Brooks, Knox-Monarchs County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Good evening. How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| I'm good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Take us through the step of use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| I also was on board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| We've had a couple of use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Could have been somebody had a dog kennel, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Step – use on review could be an agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| It could be – so, take us through the steps, first of all, and how you would decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| A use on – well, we look at the zoning ordinance to determine what uses are permitted by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| or what would require additional review by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| So, for those uses that have been identified in the zoning code as permissible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| through the use on review process, an applicant would submit an application to Knox-Monarchs County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| Staff would review it in coordination with our colleagues at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| And then we would present a recommendation to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| and they would take final action either to approve, deny, or approve with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| And currently, if a senior or someone that wanted to appeal a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1669)|
| 0:28:00| they will go to BZA, pay the $200, and it's – BZA is a quasi-judicial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| They're acting judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| And most of the time, I don't – that decision is final there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| They don't take it on to chance record because they felt like they had –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| that citizen had a chance to state their case, and the coach is there, planning is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1699)|
| 0:28:30| Sometimes it may – somebody may hire a lawyer to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| I feel uncomfortable taking it a step away from a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| I do really feel uncomfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| I don't see – if it's a neighbor that – and I keep saying the one about the dog kennel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| because that's the one I remember the most of, the result of that use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| I don't remember the outcome totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| I think it was – I think it was upheld by coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| Coach went out and checked it, and it was not really a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| They were selling dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| But it got settled there at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| You didn't have to go to chance record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| A lot of them will get settled at BZA at $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Forget the money as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| It's not about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| It's about the process of the average citizen being able to go in front of a judicial body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1763)|
| 0:29:32| that is able to hear both sides of the story and come up with a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| And like I say, most of those decisions are never, ever appealed to any type of court on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| So I see Mr. Snowden heading that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Jim Snowden, Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| It's kind of strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I vaguely remember the dog kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I think that was an administrative decision that my office made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| which if this resolution approved and goes to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| those interpretations by my department would still go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Just the use on review appeals would be removed and go to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| So we have people all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We've got one on this month's agenda where somebody is appealing our decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| and our interpretation of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| So in that case, those still would go to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| That would be the venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| So I just wanted to clarify that a little bit, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| But under the agricultural zoning, I use the dog kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Under the agricultural zoning, if it is approved as use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| that is appealable to BZA as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Not necessarily that they violate any codes violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| It is still appealable to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| I just brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| So I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| As much as I don't want to see being on BZA, I was there from 2009 through 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1865)|
| 0:31:19| Mr. Thompson came on in 2016 until a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| I don't want to see that step taken away from the citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| If it's really serious enough that it has to be taken to chancery court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| once they get to BZA, they've got to be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Their right hand goes in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And their own record of stating what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| All that is is more court record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| If that goes past BZA, whoever is satisfied with the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| they're going to take it to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Now they've got a record to take with them to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| So I'm just not in favor of taking one step away from the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| I'm going to call the averages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I've asked Driscilla to put up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| The planning department has a great resource on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| It's very easy to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Under the resources, there's a part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| there's a tab called resources on our website in the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| It's a very easy site map to sort of better understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| My question is for Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| With this ordinance, I mean, with this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| or this is a recommendation to go back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| They would have to debate it and determine whether or not to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| such a motion that would then come back to us for codification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| This is just a recommendation to go to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Knox Planning and MPC for them to get input from BZA and from codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| and from all the people that go into the process to see if this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| something that would be desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| So as the body that likely has the most experience on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| and would receive the most input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| they would probably do a much deeper dive into this and it would still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| if it was approved, it would still come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Would this ordinance potentially eliminate BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| or would they still hear cases in certain circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| BZA would still continue to make administrative zoning decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| like expectations and waivers to zoning rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| It would simply take away the use on review appeal to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| All their other powers remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| I'm going to call on Commissioner Ward and then Commissioner Busler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| who has not spoken, and then I want to ask Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| if he would like to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Yeah, I was going to say, Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| you look like you want to weigh in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Do you want to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Commissioner Smith and I, as has been discussed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| are opposing a change to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| to streamline the use on review appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| This is specific to use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| The current system of appeals slowly matriculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| from the Planning Commission to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| and often, finally, all the way to the Chancellor's Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Our proposal would simply eliminate the second step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| and allow these complex zoning decisions to be made by an elected judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| not an unelected body, for relatively the same cost to the plaintiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| The fact of the matter is we are in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| So when we're talking about delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| even if they're only 30 to 90 days in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| that is hurting our housing inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Hanson Sale from the Realtors Association laid it out a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| a couple months ago, when he said that a healthy inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| means we have six months of housing inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| if no new building permits are issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| We currently have two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| So in that case, yes, 30 to 90 days of a development coming online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| do make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| This is just one small change that we can make to eliminate redundancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| and create faster and also more responsible development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Commissioner Ward, did you have anything to weigh in on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Going over this, what's going on here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| let me ask Jim, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| Yes, sir, Commissioner Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| When you have a denial of, say, a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2173)|
| 0:36:22| normally what you do is normally against the person that's got the property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2182)|
| 0:36:30| Yes, and there's been both instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| We went back and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| It can be either the applicant that maybe is the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| or oftentimes the landowner that is disputing the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| So we've seen both come to BZA as a petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| whether it be the applicant or the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| So if it's the applicant that denies it, like, say, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| that would go to court anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Those normally go to court, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| No, part of the ordinance the way it's written now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| the first appellate process is the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| So whether you're for or against the matter per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| you have to go, the process is you have to go to BZA first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| and then, you know, depending on the outcome of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| you may end up going to Chancery Court also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| So the step right now, everything has to go through the BZA, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| That is correct, sir, as it relates to appeals of use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you, Mr. Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Before I go back to Commissioner Schoonmaker, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Mr. Stone, you may know the answer, Mr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Are use on review appeals the majority of what BZA hears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| or would you say it's other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| It is kind of becoming that nowadays, and we can share some information with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| There's been years that we haven't received any repeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| Typically, BZA is, and Commissioner Schoonmaker, Commissioner Daley have been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| they know better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| typically what we see on a month-to-month basis is setbacks, accessory structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| more of what I would consider to be the administrative type zoning interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| The use on review appeals are something that's not very common,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| but the last few years they have started to become more common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Mr. Snowden, kind of to follow up on the chairman's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| in the past 12 months how many uses on reviews have been deferred to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| In what time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| The past 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| I looked it up by calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| I didn't do necessarily 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| In calendar year 22 to date, there's been two use on review appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Okay, two in four months then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| And then is it still the BZA's policy that someone can get on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| ask for an appeal up to seven days, seven calendar days prior to the BZA meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| We still use the bylaws that you as chairman created, so yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| So it's not an extended period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| So, Brooks, normally on an ordinance of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| it would come through your department first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Why was this kind of done the other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| I can't speak to the history of how ordinances have come before planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| but it's not uncommon for the legislative body to initiate a request for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| take a closer look at a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| and then we would review it and send it back to you all with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| And then just the other thing I think in my experience on BZA was that when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2409)|
| 0:40:18| public came and appeared before basically fellow citizens, nobody was in a coat and tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| I mean, it was a very, very relaxed atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| And I think the public felt like they got their day in court because they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| actually speaking to fellow neighbors and citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| If you now take that process and send them to the courtroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| that courtroom is very intimidating for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And if you're trying to shut the public out of a process by doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| I think you're going to end up doing it that way because a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| unless they hired legal counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| would be very intimidated to go into one of our Knox County courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| and have to appear before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| So I think you need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| And then, Mr. Chairman, as a matter of procedure, because this is an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| does this not have to be a no recommendation because you would have to vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| in a regular commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Because it's classified as an ordinance on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| It's on the agenda as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| It says on Exhibit A ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| That's what I'm reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| That's why my question was proposed to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| I'll ask the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| I believe it's the original ordinance that's the exhibit, is it not, Director Buch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| The resolution which attaches the ordinance or the proposed ordinance is Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| So this really is just a request to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Commissioner Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Yeah, I wanted to follow up on Commissioner Shoemaker's argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| that the individual would be intimidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Again, this is not a court procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| The jury has already had a testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| It is a summary judgment made by the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Can you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| I couldn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| I think you're leaning on your mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| Director Buch, Commissioner Shoemaker has said that this would be a very intimidating process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| for an individual, a citizen, to be in the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| A citizen would have no role in that courtroom other than to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| Would there even be an open court for which these decisions are made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Yeah, there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| The judge gets the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| That's all he can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| He gets the record basically that comes from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| BZA, it doesn't matter what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| The appeal is coming up, and the judge is going to look at that record from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| I'd throw something else in here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| There's no problem with the public coming and expressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| but if a decision is made based on public sentiment by the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| then that becomes what they call arbitrary and capricious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| because all the BZA can look at is what the planning commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| They're a judicial body, and just like up in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| people coming in don't get a say, and it's not going to sway the judge one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| so the BZA is in the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| That's not to say people shouldn't have a right to come in and have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| Commissioner Daly, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Mr. Smith, when I got this last week, all I read was the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| Has the caption been changed any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| It was a clerical mistake on my part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| realizing that this was a zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and the procedures it takes as a recommendation to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| It has to come from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| It has to go to them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| It's basically like a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| If we want to make a change, which we have requested of the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| we have to request that they look at it first and then send it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| I don't have a problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| I thought it was a resolution to start changing the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| without going back to the proper procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| I support it going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| I'll support it because the public will have the chance to come before planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| and have it at their meeting and have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| If they don't show up, they don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| Since this is clarified, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| When I read it last week, I go, no, this is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| No, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| I apologize to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Then we understood the process a little better and made the correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Commissioner Smith, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| with a second by Commissioner Ward to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| Can I use the rest of my time, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Mr. Thompson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| You actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| You have a little over two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Just very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| In response to the idea that citizens can go to court pro se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2735)|
| 0:45:44| that is theoretically possible, but I think in reality, if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I don't know, probably just the teeniest fraction of 1% of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| figure out how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Most citizens cannot even figure out which courtroom it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Each court has rules of procedure, how pleadings must be drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| how evidence must be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| This is beyond your average citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I mean, again, it's theoretically possible, but it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| People are not going to be able to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| And I think the $10,000 is probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| I heard someone getting a bargain for $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| So, again, theoretically possible, but that's just not real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| That's not reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| And then I think Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| and Mayor Jacobs addressed the issue of redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| I think if you look, there's not redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| The vast majority of BZA cases stop with BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| It's not redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Actually, it's the most economical way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| It's economical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| It gives citizens a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| I understand that there will be additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| as this works through your process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I realize there will be additional opportunities to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| and I'm sure we'll have more to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| The motion before us is to approve a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| to request the Planning Commission to recommend amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Any other nos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Let the record reflect Commissioner Schoonmaker is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Item number 61, Resolution 904,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| is approving an independent contractor agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| with Hoss Forensic Consulting, PLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| to provide forensic pathology services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| for the Knox County Regional Forensic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2860)|
| 0:47:49| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Since I seconded, I'd like to know for sure who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| You get to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| You get to come and get to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Chris Thomas, Director of Knox County Regional Forensic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| So this came in as a last-minute adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| For those of you who don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| we provide autopsy services for Knox and Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| and 21 additional counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| So we had a little over 2,818 autopsies and exams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| our office did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| We had five full-time dedicated forensic pathologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| assigned to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| And as Commissioner Schoonmaker mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| in the budget session, part of our increase is we added on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| a sixth forensic pathologist at the beginning of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| to cover the caseload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| The National Association of Medical Examiners says you should do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| between 250 to 325 autopsies and exams per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| and last year we averaged 360 to 380.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| So it was quite high volume, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| Once we added that sixth pathologist in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| we got this thing under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Unfortunately, I have a very pregnant forensic pathologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and she'll be leaving us soon for maternity leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| In addition, one of our forensic pathologists' wife decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2955)|

| 0:49:21| so he is leaving as of Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| So I'm going to be down two doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| I have been advertising for a forensic pathologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and it is a very nice salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Unfortunately, there is a nationwide shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| of forensic pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| If you Googled anything about Medical Examiner's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| in the last six months, it has not been favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| from stories in Baltimore, Maryland, where 200 bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| are sitting in a storage container in a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| and people are waiting in Mississippi almost four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| to get autopsies on homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| That's some very scary statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| We have it fully under control here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| You don't have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Everybody gets home, and 48 hours or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| we get them to their final resting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| That being said, the Deputy State Chief Medical Examiner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Dr. Amy Hawes, who used to be a forensic pathologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| for our office in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Dr. Milucinic reached out to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| and she offered to take some vacation time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| in the month of June to cover a few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| to help with this caseload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| So we had a contract with Dr. Hawes in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| She did some locum work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| and that contract was canceled when we no longer needed her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| And when she offered it, I jumped through hoops last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| got the contract, had her attorney reviewed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| and begged the commission to throw this on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| so I could put her to work for five days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| in the month of June, starting on June 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| So I couldn't wait to put this to the June commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| because I need her in there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| to kind of take some of the heat off my existing doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| And we will plan on continuing using her when she's able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| until I can get the position filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| And unfortunately, we have no applicants at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| so this will be a continued part of the line item budget transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| was we're actually transferring funds from salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| back into operating so that I can pay the locum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| So there's no additional expense in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| That's what we've been paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| I'm just moving it from salaries to operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| so we can cover the contracting work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| up to what I would use for salaries on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| I'm trying to go over this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| So that's $3,000 a day flat fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| That covers the pathologist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Yeah, that covers the autopsies performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| and the completion of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| So the reviewing of medical records, autopsy photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| ordering additional testing, and issuing that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| And if anything needs to go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| they'll offer that services or one of our existing forensic pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| Most likely, Dr. Mlucinic would cover those court cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| And we're already paying for this now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| The salary of a forensic pathologist is $240,000 a year starting off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| so I'm transferring about $24,000 a month from salaries into operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| So that five days will be like $18,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| So I'm actually saving the county some additional funds until we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Sort of a good deal because that same $3,000 rate is what we paid her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| three years ago when she did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| And Dr. Oliver, who will be on the agenda next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| who's coming back as well, too, renewing his contract for locum work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| So that will be $3,000 a day as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| All right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516?start=3149)|
