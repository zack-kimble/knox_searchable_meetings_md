| 0:00:34| First of all, I'd like to make several announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| I want to recognize the council members that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=37)|

| 0:00:54| and again, as I said, Jeannie's going to explain what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| I'd also like to present a former council lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| Carly Malone, who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=62)|

| 0:01:09| We have one candidate, I think, running for city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| and that's Wayne Christensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Wayne is up front here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=74)|

| 0:01:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=81)|

| 0:01:26| Then we have, from the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=86)|

| 0:01:34| We also have former city administrator person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| is Bob Wetzel, who's here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=98)|

| 0:01:46| Peter Ahrens is also in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| so we have a good representation of the folks that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| I'd like to go ahead and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| Marshall, if you will come forward to lead the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| Please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| Would the chair really give me the roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Councilman Brown, Councilman Campbell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Councilman Dela Lope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Vice Mayor Greene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Councilman Plummer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Councilman Padlas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Councilman Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Councilman Starrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| Okay, I'm going to say a few words about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=162)|
| 0:02:52| I want to say a few words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| about what we hope to accomplish this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| And as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| our facilitator, Jeannie Delaney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| will be leading us in this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| And basically what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| is to do something similar that we did last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| with the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| And the hope is that the tables that are set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| that we have a mix of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| that are both concerned about STRs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| in terms of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| and people that are interested in trying to have an STR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| And what we would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| is for this group then at each table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| to talk about what their concerns are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| both in favor and against having STRs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| either in their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| or anywhere in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| And as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Jeannie's going to explain a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Also, I want to just let you know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| as we mentioned last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| council workshops are council workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| In other words, we are not doing public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| at our council workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| We will be doing public forum, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| as usual at our council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| I want to give you a couple of dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| in terms of opportunities that you'll have to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| If all goes well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| the city council will pass this on to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| at our August 29th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| That'll be two weeks from next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| We'll send it off to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| MPC will hear it on October 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| And if no action by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| they will send it back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| where we will have two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| one on November 7th and one on November 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| And as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| both MPC and city council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| there will be the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| for a public forum on the issues at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| So I'm sure that a lot of you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| that are in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| I see some faces that were here last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| I'm sure that a lot of you have emailed us or called us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| and I think that the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| can probably say that we've gotten a lot of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| both pro and also with the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| in terms of the STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| I think speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| in the eight years that I've been on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| this is probably one of the most involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| by the community of the issues that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I mentioned last week that on the signed task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| we spent three and a half years working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| I don't think we had the kind of outpouring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| of either support or against a particular issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| as we've had on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| so it's very crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| It's very crucial tonight that as the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| you take the opportunity to talk to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| As I said, I hope that the tables are not all one-sided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| that if it is, try to mix yourself up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Council members will be floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| They're not going to sit down at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| and just take control over a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| They're to float around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| and listen to what you folks have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| So next what I'd like to do is thank Jeannie Delaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Jeannie has been with us for the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| actually it's probably been six plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| that she has helped us on council to be who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| She has facilitated our retreats that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| and I think they've all been very, very successful on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| And so with that, Jeannie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| I want to thank you again publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| but I want you to come up and put them to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| All right, I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| All right, if you're a participant in the back of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| if you'll be sure and come and find a place for the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| There's a whole table right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| There's some space here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| The more the table, actually, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| Participants, come on up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| While you're moving forward, also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Gerald Green, our executive director with Emergency, came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Gerald, you're out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| He's in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| I don't think I missed anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Where's Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| There's Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| Okay, so one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Any of you all standing in the back of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| if you really want to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| please find a space and a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| Make yourself a name tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| First name only is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=430)|
| 0:07:21| All right, I'm going to assume they want to observe back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Well, welcome, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| I think this is very refreshing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| I know some of you all were here last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| You observed what council did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| That was council-centric, and their outcomes are on the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| as you hopefully have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Tonight, it's citizen-centric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| They want to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Same sort of format, what are the pros around STRs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| and or what are some of your concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| So it's actually, like I said, a pretty simple format tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| What I would like to ask you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| well, let me get to just a couple of ground rules very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| I hope everyone will do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| I think you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Respect everyone's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| There are going to be some different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Make sure everyone at your table gets heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| and if you would kindly silence your cell phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| So everybody's in the room, ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| So my job as facilitator is simply to keep you on task and on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and help make sure council gets all the input they can from you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| The best way to deal with any sort of problem-solving effort, which this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| is to work out of small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| and then share all the information at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| It will all be captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| No comments will be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| They'll be typed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Council will have it all as they continue their decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| So there are pads at each table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Unless you already have some paper handy, grab a little paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| There's a couple of pens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| What I want to ask you to do first is just individually, sort of quietly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| jot down pros and or concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| Hopefully you'll have a little bit of both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| but if you don't, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| We'll give you a few minutes to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| and then I want you to share at your table your individual pros and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| While you're doing that, we're going to bring around some flip chart paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| that ultimately I want you to ascribe on your collective pros and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| You'll probably have a few common ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| but you can capture everything you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| And that's what the sharpie is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Yes, got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Yeah, you're probably going to be listing just concerns, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| Yeah, if you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| Pros for short-term rentals, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| And concerns about those, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Now we've got a group mixing up here, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| We're going to hear your individual thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Yeah, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| This is a problem solving exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| What precisely is the problem solving exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| How to deal with STRs as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| Okay, is everybody straight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| We'll be coming around and floating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| but basically you're going to do sort of like council did last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| What are some pros if you have those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| What are some concerns if you have those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| A little bit of work individually, then start sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| and we'll start bringing around paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Participants, if you just came in, find yourself a place at a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=658)|
| 0:11:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Whoever did that whistle, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| All right, the vice mayor has a few remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| and then we're going to start seeing and hearing your outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you, Gina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| I want to make some additional announcements about who came in that I missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| We have also from the city, we have Eric Breland back there in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| and we have David Massey, our neighborhood coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| and then former council lady Barbara Pelow came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| She's there at the third table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| And then I also want to introduce MPC folks who came from their meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| to come and listen and hear what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| We have Rebecca Longmeyer, the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| We have Charlie Thomas, once again, who was introduced earlier as a former council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| Matt Goodwin, James Todler, Laura Cole, and Mike Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| and we're glad that you folks are here also to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| So, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| All right, I'm going to get it back to Gina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| All right, so here's what we're going to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| I'm not sure I've delivered this message in every table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| but someone is going to need to be the spokesperson from your table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| and bring your results up front, put them right on the whiteboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| and then I'll hand you the mic and let you go through your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| So is this table prepared to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I would propose we send two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| We send a pro and a con.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| All right, you can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Are you all ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| No, unless you're going to present them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Then you can present your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| All right, we've got a volunteer to begin the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| So everybody, please pay attention to what the other tables have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=769)|
| 0:13:15| All right, y'all, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| This is our first table recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=796)|
| 0:13:25| All right, so we had a pretty unique table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| We're actually majority from the same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| So the majority of our table, we actually live within a couple blocks of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| which is pretty great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| So my name is Jonathan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I live in the 14th neighborhood on 726 Erie Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| We go with the pros of short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| First is small business opportunities for people that are renting out their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| And so that's helped my wife and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| The tax benefits for the city themselves, especially for business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| Low-cost opportunities for travelers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| We get a lot of families that come in that can't afford to buy four or five hotel rooms, let's say, with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=843)|
| 0:14:12| It helps us renovate homes, slash houses, and so we've been able to fix up our house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| because of the income that we got from our Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| It increased travel dollars in Knoxville, where they'll go elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| especially people in my generation that are going to travel on Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| And so it's better than them driving through Knoxville to go to Asheville, Nashville, or Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| It helps them actually spend dollars within Knoxville at local places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| We brought up the issue of property rights, of being on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| That was brought up in council last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| It also gives Nashvilleians some short-term opportunities for living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| We've got a lady staying with us now that's in between leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Can't afford a hotel for three weeks, so she's staying with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Okay, my name is Bill Murrah, and I live in 14th Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| I've been there 45 years, so it's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Anyway, violates the con.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| It violates existing zoning, which also makes people concerned that whatever changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| if the zoning is changed to allow to be more flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| that there would be violations of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| You know, the camel under the nose under the tent kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| It disrupts the social fabric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It takes a house out of an opportunity for it to be a residential home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| It is an encroachment of business into the residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| and how is that so different from being an office use in a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| The risk of single WDs, short-term rentals, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| across single-room houses, get that out of my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| of it spreading and being very widespread in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| that would be particularly attractive because it's so close to downtown UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| There is already a shortage of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Short-term rentals should be in a hotel zone because it's more like a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| The growth of short-term rentals reverses the work that a lot of people have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| in neighborhoods, inner-city neighborhoods in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| over the last decades to move houses more into homeownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| and away from things like SROs and those single-room occupancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| This one right here didn't get finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| and this was that people who come and stay one night or two or three nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| don't contribute to the activities of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1002)|
| 0:16:50| Very good job, and I congratulate you on a very civil discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| That was awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| And if someone with that green pen will just come finish the don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1016)|
| 0:17:06| All right, we don't necessarily have to go one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Does anybody, another group, want to volunteer to come on up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| All right, want this group to volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Come on, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1035)|
| 0:17:45| Hi, my name is Sarah Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1065)|
| 0:17:55| I have a short-term rental south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| Our table, pretty much everybody is for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| We have one, Terry, who really kind of came at me with her point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| which is very interesting, totally different than mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| but we came up with several different points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| On the pros, out of the 8,000 visits in Knoxville in the past three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| there have only been five complaints, and all were non-criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| All of them were people reporting that others were running an illegal business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| So that's a very low percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Property value increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| I have put thousands and thousands of dollars into my short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| that I would not have put into it if it had stayed as a long-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| Enforcement measures are already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| We already have a system, whether you're a homeowner, a long-term renter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| short-term renter, they're already set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| So if your neighbor has too many cars or they're being too loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| then you go next door and you talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| And if that doesn't work, then you call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| So these are already set up, whether you own it or you rent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| It's good for tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| It puts money back into the local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| I have people saying that they're coming in to do activities, downtown stuff in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| So they're putting money back into our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| From my understanding, the HOAs can enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| I'm not going to buy a house for a short-term rental if the HOAs are already set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| And that's their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| I understand them wanting to not have short-term rentals in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| It can barely compete with county STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| So as of right now, this is just a citywide ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| It wouldn't affect county STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| So if we are allowed to keep them in R1 zones where I currently have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| then I can still compete against county STRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| It's a tax source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| We will be taxed on the income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| If we have a license, we'll pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| And then the short-term rentals, the tenants and guests are screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| There is a very intense process for people to be able to come and stay at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| If they get a bad review, they are not allowed to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| So those are our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| You can see that I work with a very charming person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| And she understands my viewpoint, and I understand hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| And can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| My husband and I have lived in the Forest Heights neighborhood for 52 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| And when we moved there, half of our street was rental and was zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| Over those 52 years, I've been involved with the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| and also with the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| which was an organization formed after our Bearden Village NBC plan was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| The reason that the neighborhoods around the Bearden commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| were able to form an organization that could help create and implement the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| for the small area plan for our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| was because all of our neighborhoods were at that point stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| And during the 52 years we've lived there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| I've been involved with helping stabilize Forest Heights for 47 years, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1277)|
| 0:21:25| And it's been a long and hard road to where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| which is mostly neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| The thing that I see is that in stabilizing areas that are adjacent to the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| and we have the inner city stabilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| is that we are now stabilizing out from the inner city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| older neighborhoods that have been through rough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| And it's hard for people to believe that neighborhoods in Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| went through very rough times because you don't have the perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| And to me, you can't perceive what can happen to a neighborhood that destabilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| which is one of the reasons that I think it's going to be destabilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| to neighborhoods where people have bought and are one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| feeling like there's not going to be businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| believing that, investing their money, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| But anyway, basically, I would say that we feel that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| I feel that the same as Phil Earl does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| who has spent money in his neighborhood stabilizing his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| I think there's great potential to devalue property values in R1 zones and R1Ds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| And it puts a business in an R1 and an R1D zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| When people buy their house in R1, R1D, they think they're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| safe from businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| And it's a major investment of your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| One question that we came up with is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| would the city ordinance override homeowner association's covenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| our rules that short-term rentals would not be allowed under their covenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1382)|
| 0:23:11| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| The draft code says no, it cannot override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Yes, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| But I think some people misunderstood it in the area we were in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| that a city law is going to override any homeowner's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| It's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| It's not going to override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Okay, it might be good for somebody to further explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| So if our homeowner's organization says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| we will not allow the MVs, short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| then that overrides the city law ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| Well, it's not the MVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| It's the covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| If it's another organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| that actual level of covenants doesn't go through the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| that's a major distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Those are formal ones, the covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| These are things that run with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Run with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| You have to get every homeowner that's still on to that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| You can't just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| we're here with the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| and here are our boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| and the board votes this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| You have to get every single owner to attach that to his deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| as part of a covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Can I clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| You see those in new subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| and in condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| They're part of the overall fabric of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| She's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| If you're going to start from scratch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| come up with covenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| you literally are making a contract with everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| that lives in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| I don't mean to beat you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I do it without being kind of order and manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| I just have a real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| fundamental question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And, Ward, you know what I'm going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| I think you probably know what you're going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| As a homeowner who lives in an R1E in West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| why are we not protected with the existing laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| the existing zoning laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Because the way I look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| it's our covenant with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| And to entertain the idea of violating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| our existing zoning protections that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| with R1, R1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| and to allow a business enterprise into those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| is a violation of our covenant with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| the city being our homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| to use that for an analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| So where am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Can someone in the back address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1537)|
| 0:25:48| Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| You're going to address the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| How about I just speak loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| How about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| All right, it's downhill from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| The question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| how I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| anything that ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| how am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| What was the premise of the statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| The question is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| is that as a homeowner who lives in a R1E zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| do I not have a covenant with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| saying that we are protected with existing zoning law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| then what's the value of that law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| The answer to that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| city law and ordinances are constantly changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| None of us have a covenant for the status quo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| to be there indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| There is no such thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| So that's why we're having this process to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| But currently they are in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| That's his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| They're in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| You have short-term rental properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| that are in violation of existing law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| The city does not enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| And I want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| what's the value of entertaining the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| of creating another law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| that will be unenforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| and absolutely meaningless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| You're undermining the value of our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| The city presently enforces the rental restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| When we get a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| we've gotten a specific call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| and people have been running these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| and we know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| They've been asked to cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| It's complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Complaint-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| As are most such violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| So if I were to make a complaint at this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| and say that every Airbnb property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| every short-term rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| that's in an R1E zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| is in violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| what is the city going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| The laws are complaint-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| As a citizen in this property on Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| I'm making a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| that every Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| every short-term rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| that's in an R1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| any kind of residential zone area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| is in violation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| And I'd like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| what the city plans to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| The city responds to complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| about individual properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| that are operating outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| the existing ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| when we get them on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| That's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| You may not like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| but that's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| When you say on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| do you mean there is no response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| that applies in all situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| or that you only respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| to one complaint at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| What's one complaint about one property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| It's the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| And we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| and we're looking to get this in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| so we can better have a catalog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| through various mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| of existing appropriately permitted units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| so that when we find out about one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| we can proactively deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| But right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| we deal with any violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| of the ordinance that allows rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| which doesn't allow short-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| When there is a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| we respond to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| and we deal with it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| I'm going to interrupt now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Actually, the vice mayor is interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Let's get back on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| These folks will be here at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| So who is our next reporter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Great job, this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| We have six more tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| We've got more tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Who wants to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Who's bringing in bread?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Y'all ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| We're going to get you out on time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Come on, girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1782)|
| 0:29:52| All right, everybody listen up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Be respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Our table didn't follow the rules of two sheets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| and our table wasn't really sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Like, I was not sweet to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| I'm sorry, Mike, but I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| So if Mike wants to come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| and do the prose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| he and I about took to fighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| so I'll let him do the prose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I am Carol Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| I live at 1101 Craig Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| in the Forest Brook area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Our table had other Forest Brook neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| and quite a number of neighbors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| And we're in what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| And we are all in our one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| And we think this absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| I'll go over the cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| This totally ignores the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| just like y'all were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| so I won't go into more detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| We don't want them in our zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| We think there will be noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| There is going to be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| with the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| because they don't enforce it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Commercial business in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| is against the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| The risk of R1 and R1E future sale of our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| If I came to my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| and knew there was a short-term rental next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| I would not buy the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Not the short-term rental house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| I wouldn't buy my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Who verifies the number of people in a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| when they're staying there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| The American with Disabilities Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Like hotels and motels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| you said you're going to charge them hotel-motel taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| Do they have to comply with American with Disabilities Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| like hotels and motels do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Inherited, like if someone has a house like Mike does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| if he wants to give it to his son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| does his son have to have a new permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| or does he get to inherit that permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| If you are going to force us to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| it needs to be under an open permit process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| just like a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| and have signage placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| and let the whole neighborhood know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| Street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Our street is narrow with no striping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| It's already busy and dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| We have mamas pushing their babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| People walking and taking their pets out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| We don't even park on our own street because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| so we don't want anybody visiting parking on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| causing dangerous situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Strangers and safety in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| with more strangers coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| We have lots of children in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Reduces neighborhood watch protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| because we don't know who's doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Also, we have a wonderful harmony in our neighborhood, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| but we know everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| If we do this, it's not going to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| And the old hoods like ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| we don't have homeowner associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| We were built in the 20s, 30s, 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| You didn't have them back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| so we can't protect ourselves from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| under that regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| And Mike, do you want to come tell the crows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Mike's crows were that Airbnb can make dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| People can make dollars from having these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| And this brings people from all over the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| to visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Has some tax revenue for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| He said it's today's reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| Visitors come, and they can see our great neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Was there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| No, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Great job, Carol. Good bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Let's try to do bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| You all ready? Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1979)|
| 0:33:16| We're a husband and wife team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| but nobody else wanted to speak from the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| so I'll take the cons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| even though I think the pros win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| But anyways, the first con was parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| That there wouldn't be enough parking space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| for people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| I can't speak for all S.T.R.s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| but parking's not an issue with my rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| because I only allow four people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| which is the number of beds that I have in my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| I don't do air mattresses from wall to wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| And I've got four...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Well, I wanted to answer the con.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Loss of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| I don't think there's any more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| than what you would have from a regular rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| But if you think there's a traffic problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| It's unregulated currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| And it's the violation of a homeowner's bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| But we've had a wonderful discussion at our table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| and I think they've all realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| that HOAs take top billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| You can't just serve an HOA when you buy a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| and you go by those bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| The problem is people who ignore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| People that ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| That was the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| And they will not be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| So now I'm going to show you some pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Well, the pros are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| it provides a civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| During the Gatlinburg fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| I got a phone call from someone in California| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| who said, you have a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| I have friends that have a home in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| They have to get out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| I said, it's ready. No charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| And they're there in an hour smelling of smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| The same thing happened with two hurricanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| this past year on the East Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| The hotels cannot take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| There's not enough hotel space to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| the whole East Coast as they leave a hurricane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| Well, these are an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| All of a sudden they have a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| And they were both filled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| And this again, you can give it to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| no charge or a discount or charge them regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| But for whatever reason, they've got a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| We have something for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| If there was more Airbnbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| we could absorb them much easier into our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| and provide that civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| That provides, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| financial opportunities for the host and the guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| They have a place they like to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| They have that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Revitalization of blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| But there are some very nice Airbnbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| in Sequoia Hills as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| And they're not blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| They're great places in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Talks about tourism for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| And, of course, the freedom of choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| of people to stay where they want to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Not everybody wants to stay downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| They may have reasons they don't want to stay in a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| There was one thing where a young girl had autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| She wasn't comfortable in staying in a home where you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| but they liked their own home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| People should have that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| When you go on a vacation, you have that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Why couldn't they do that anywhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| And by the way, these places are not occupied 100% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| So usually the noise is less, the parking is less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| the garbage is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| They should abide by all rules in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| That's what someone said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| So we want to abide by those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| And they have laws that govern us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| that should govern them just as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| such as noise and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| We talk about empowering to women and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| The largest and the fastest growing demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| of Airbnb hosts is women over 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| And by far they have the highest ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| They keep clean homes, good communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| and it provides a way for them to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| for their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| And they have a great purpose in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| They get to meet a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| It's an asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| The neighbors usually like meeting the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| that are right next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| and often they're working with me as a host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| It talks about you get to meet these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| all around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Nurses come into town, need a place to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Doctors, professors at UT, international lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| at home, and international business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| And the neighbors get to meet them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| and enjoy their company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Also it talks about there's no burden on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| What they mean there is people staying at Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| are not here for a long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| so they don't have kids in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Yet the property taxes are being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| And what is it, 60% of our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| goes to the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Well, that's a benefit to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Or like 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Well, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| It's even higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| But remember too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| you can rent a home in every area of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Every area of town you can rent a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| And that's a nice thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| And what's the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| between 29 days or 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| that they can rent? That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| So we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| four reports so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Y'all come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Obviously we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| there are going to be duplications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| maybe the ones coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| the pipe now, point out anything that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| different. Or if you want to reinforce something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| that will be coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Y'all are doing really good with the bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2300)|
| 0:38:40| Contrary to some of the tables before us, I actually think we had a really civil discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2320)|
| 0:38:51| And I actually really appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| the discussion we had at our table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| about our differing viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| I was the lone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| pro at our table, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I feel like it went well and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| appreciate the opportunity to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| There were a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I was outnumbered on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| this one, but I think there were some points that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| definitely hadn't thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Some of these have already been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Oh, you're going to do the cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| So I'm not going to do the cons. I'll start with the pros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| The pros are some people prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| and may facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| tourism for people who enjoy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| the type of Airbnb experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| We talked about that before, so I won't go into that too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| But there are some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| and it might bring in kind of a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| kind of tourism. People who like the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| businesses and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| There's a potential for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| revenue for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| And one thing that we tossed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| or maybe I tossed out was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| the potential for that revenue to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| to be utilized to promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| enforcement, which isn't happening right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| due to talking about there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| actually enforce these things. But if taxes were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| collected, then those taxes can be utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| to enforce whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| businesses they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| It promotes access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| to businesses in safe and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| walkable neighborhoods where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| things to walk to, where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| is not currently other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| housing or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| there aren't hotels or other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| which is definitely true in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| of Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| And that it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| promote well-maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| houses, I think. One of the things we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| people who host Airbnbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| are highly motivated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| to have well-maintained properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| to take good care of them. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| do far more yard work now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| than I ever would have before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| if I didn't have people staying there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| and it wasn't incentivized to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I think that promotes the fabric of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| my neighborhood and my involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| in my neighborhood. And then we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| some costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| I want to ask Caleb if he might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| want to weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| as I'm about to do on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| pros and just add a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| The preference and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| reason it says may facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| tourism is some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| have said it promotes tourism and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| there's a reasonable position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| says people don't come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| just because they can stay in a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| term rental. They come for a lot of other reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| and they may find it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| to their preference to use a short term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| rental, but that's not what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| promoted through. The potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| is there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| one additional observation on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| is that if the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| were to proceed with this, we would expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| that that revenue would be devoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| to enforcement, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| devoted to enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Access to business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| and the reason there's a qualifier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| here in safe, walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| neighborhood and our neighborhood is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| example. I live in the same neighborhood in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Carrolla. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| streets are 19 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| There are no sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| in the entire area between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Linesview Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Ebenezer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| and Westland and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| There are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| sidewalks throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| that entire area on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| narrow streets, so making that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| that's just a distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| and the issue of well maintained houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I don't want to comment on, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| college runs counter to the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| and that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| referenced and that is not a small issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| The land use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| are law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| and if in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| people to flout that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| we have a problem. Investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| have been made in the R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| neighborhoods which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| single family residential. Each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| words is important. Single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| family residential. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| reason zoning districts exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Enforcement, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| not clear on what the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| suggests in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| of enforcement. It's not mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| in the draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Civility versus transient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| The city was very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| to use the words in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| draft ordinance and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| defined and the word that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| chose to use for the guest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| short term rentals is transient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| The word that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| heard used most often tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| with regard to single family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| is stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| If you look at the definition of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| transient, it is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| short duration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| compare that with stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| nuisance issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I think has been addressed. A decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| as dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| in a single family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| neighborhood go out of occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| by single families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| that decreases the availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| of housing for the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| A sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| safety. An example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Caleb was sharing with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| characteristics of having a short term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| rental. Sometimes people are coming in at 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| or 10.30 in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| If someone comes into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| street, which is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| particularly well lighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| and they drive into the wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| driveway at 10.30 at night and knock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| on the door, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| is not stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| Loss of single family concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I think that goes without saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Tax equality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| are commercial uses in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| does that mean the county will now classify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| properties as commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| instead of a 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| there will be a 40% application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| in terms of commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| I don't know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| to that but it is a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Not appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| for all zones. If you look at that map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| that is taped over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| this is one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| the city has made available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| through some sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| that they have. The dots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| on there show to the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| of whoever was doing the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| where the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| short term rentals are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| There are wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| swaths of areas throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| the city where there are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| short term rentals. Yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| the ordinance that is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| would do a blanket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| of the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| If we take the facts that are known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| I asked the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| at the beginning, let's define the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| If that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| in allowing short term rentals throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| the city where there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| a wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| dispersion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| wide dispersion. There are concentrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| areas that are shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| effect on property value. None of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| know the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| but that is uncertainty. Uncertainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| is defined as risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| There is a risk of changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Concern of no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| resident on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| average tenure of my four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| across the street is 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| We've known each other for a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| That changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| When we come back to that issue of stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| versus transient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| that's an important distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| increase in general activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| As Caleb said, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| expectation would be that people might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| walk to the nearest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| place. If you walk to the nearest place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| from our neighborhood, first of all, there's no sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| and the nearest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| commercial use of any kind is eight blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| It is accessed by North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Anybody want to walk on North Shore Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| want to say Caleb was really helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| in sharing with us the characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| of the guests that he has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| the nature of their visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| and so on. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| his participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| to ask you again because we're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| seeing more duplications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Sort of go through bullet point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| style or point out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| ones that maybe have not been covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| and not responding to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Everybody listening to the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| We've got a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2881)|
| 0:48:17| Okay. So we've gone ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| and crossed off points that have already been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| On our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| concern list, the city currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| deems Airbnbs as an illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| hotel. We want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| be legal as Airbnbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| so we would like that to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| We also are concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| absentee landlords. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| this applies specifically to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| non-owner-occupied Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| So with the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| proposal, this could not happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| in any residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| But our concern is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| fabric of it is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| people that want to do the best for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| neighborhood. They want to do right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Absentee landlords are not using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Airbnbs in the way that they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| We also are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| concerned how do neighbors know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| to reach the point of contact that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| on the listing as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| if they're not the owner, whoever's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| supposed to be contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Anything you'd like to add, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| I'll let you finish and then I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Okay. So then for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| pros, Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| allows for family income. It closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| the income gap. My husband and I are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| business owners. We've owned our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| for four years. It's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| hard for small businesses to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| and to continue operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Airbnb allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| to stay in our home. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| makes it affordable for us. Otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| it would not be affordable and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| we might not be able to continue running our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| and have to go and get other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| So it helps us create jobs for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Airbnb is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| a pipeline for new homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| Just last week we had people that were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| in Knoxville because they wanted to live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| Knoxville. So they're staying in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| of Park Ridge to look for a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| That doesn't happen with hotels. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Short-term rentals are different in that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| customizable. So it attracts a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| international people that otherwise would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| not come to Knoxville. They probably wouldn't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| hear about Knoxville. They'd skip us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| right over and go straight to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| is also a safe option for lodging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| People feel safer coming to a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| than they do staying at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| hotel right off the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| And then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| permits can be enforced through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| proposed software. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Chattanooga, Asheville, Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| they've all started using a software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| that scans the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| website listings for permit numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| So that's one way that these permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| will be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| expound on a couple of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| One is, it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| hard to, if there's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| it's really hard to attribute to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| short-term rental if you don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| it's a short-term rental. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| the neighborhoods need to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| when, in the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| if somebody is applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| for a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| The other one is, if there's a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| as a neighborhood person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| I don't have to go to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I want to be able to talk. If it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| really simple, just go talk to the short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| rental operator, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| would need to have the contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| information to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| Okay, great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| And thank you for marking off the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| that have already been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| So, I think we've got a couple more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| who's ready. Yeah, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3101)|
| 0:51:59| All right. My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Jonathan. I'm from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Marble City community, and I'll just go through these points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| quickly, because I'm hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Crows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| on our list, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| it's the sharing culture that seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| to be evolving in, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| the country and, I guess, around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| We own part of that. I would cross off a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| that I already mentioned. Offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| an alternative for travelers, both financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| and maybe a better financial option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| as well as, I know there's some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| who just get tired of staying in hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| if they travel a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Can improve the aesthetics of a street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| or a neighborhood. A lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| people who have Airbnbs, like somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| mentioned before, they try to take really good care of their houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| to make it look good. Obviously, since that's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Guests are screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| So, it's not just anybody coming to stay in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Airbnb. They have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| option to say, this is a good guest, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| not a good guest. You don't have to take them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| if they've been reviewed poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Long-term community growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| It's good to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| talking at our table, we're not against regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I think that would be a healthy thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Airbnb if we can make sure that everybody's on the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| page with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| Keeps Knoxville progressive and relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| for how the world's moving and the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| types of businesses that are evolving with the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| And it's within the property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| of the homeowners, is my last point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| My name is Jerry Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Forest Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| I will be going over the cons today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| A lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| of these have been mentioned, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| I really wanted to start this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| The noise and disturbing the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| That's important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| I was actually part of an Airbnb party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| state, and I would not want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| the neighbor that heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| that next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| I don't want that next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Again, crowded parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| go through the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| The traffic and speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| as the beer runs low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| at these rowdy parties at 2 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| zipping up down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And then the slippery slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| the definition of zoning laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| and all of this changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| How does this evolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| in a negative way for our neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I love the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| that I live in, and I'd hate to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| change for the worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Evolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| of STRs into larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| investor-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| I know that we had talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| keeping them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| owner-occupied, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| does that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| 10 years down the road or 5 years down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| I think we mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| illegal activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| human trafficking, drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Here are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| horror stories out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3295)|
| 0:55:05| They mentioned investor-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| You mean someone would buy up several of these and run it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| I think we have one more report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| Everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| that we've talked about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| really has already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| we saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| the sticky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| on the back, and we had no idea what that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| for, so we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| folded ours in half because we thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| kind of hard to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Don't expect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| to put it up on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3353)|
| 0:56:17| I was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| to be pro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| I really don't like public speaking, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| I think there are a lot of good reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| to allow short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| One of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| that I don't think has really been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| talked about a lot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| I think it gives an opportunity for social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| People that might want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| to bump up to a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| concerned parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| maybe they don't have a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| but they want to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| a nicer house in a nicer neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| and Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| might give those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| have their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| have better lives because they can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| a better house because they can rent there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| and make money on Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| I think that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| more people that host| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Airbnbs that actually need the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| than maybe has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| been mentioned here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| and they want that money to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| them live a better life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| I think that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I've heard a lot of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| say a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| of statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| seem very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| correct and right, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| I see that there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| things that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| people who are living in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| who are not doing Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| how, yeah, I can see how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| maybe I don't like that idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| at the end of the day, I think there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| a case that can be made for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| haves and have nots in social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| mobility and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| folks being able to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| their lives by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| having their largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| asset make money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| them. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| Hi, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Amy. I'm from Portis Heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| neighborhood, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| had a variety of people from different neighborhoods at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| table, and we appreciated John's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| He definitely gave us a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| perspective on Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Y'all hit most of what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| talked about, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| the one thing that I asked John is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| I said, you know, has he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| how long has he lived in this neighborhood, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| has he been associated with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| neighborhood association, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| you know, one thing that's really made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| difference for us and for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| is getting to know my community, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| you know, working with Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| the city has really encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| communities to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| and to bond and to engage with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| neighbor, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| the hardest thing about this STR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| is that there's going to be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| engaging with the short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| This ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| is putting neighbors against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| neighbors. Once again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| up to us to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| to enforce this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| call our neighbors, you know, talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| to our neighbors and have to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| the city on them if there's a noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| issue, if there's traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| if there's parking, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| it goes against what we've been trying to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| So, anyway, just something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| to think about that maybe hasn't been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Alright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| I'm about at the conclusion of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| job tonight, which was simply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| help facilitate your all's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| and I'm going to turn the mic over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| to the Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| here in just a second, but I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| applaud you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| I think it was probably helpful to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| I think you all did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| in a beautiful manner. I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| outcomes are going to be very helpful to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| council. All of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| will be typed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| In fact, I know a couple of council people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| would love to even have your individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| notes at your tables if you'll just leave them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| there if you're comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| So that will all be part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| as well, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| council, you've got some work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| don't you? So let me turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| to Dwayne, and thank you all for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| work tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Let's give Jeannie a round of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Last week and this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| we really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| Jessie, if you would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| forward, Jeannie has mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| that all of this will be typed up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| summarized. The council's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| workshop from last week has already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| done, and Jessie's going to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| to you where you'll be able to find this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| on the city website. We'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| to have the, for all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| not only have a copy of it, but let the other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| know also. So Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| I'd just like to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| ordinance. It's not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Airbnb ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| and we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| about the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| or the ratings that the customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| get. One of my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| that I don't think has been expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| is that there are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| be other hosting agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| and we don't know the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| And so I think that is a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| concern also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Yeah, so we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| a page already on the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| website devoted to short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| It has the draft ordinance up there and sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| the work we've gone through up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| and we will add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| what Duane and Will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| send us from these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| And the URL for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| page, like a lot of the URLs on the city website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| is a fairly long one. So the easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| way to get to that page, go to the city website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| knoxvilletn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| There's a search bar right at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Just type in short-term rental, and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| first result is going to be the short-term rental page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| And we'll have all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| that information up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Bill Lyons was saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| something about you can file a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| on an individual property, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| no one has mentioned where do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| file that complaint? I mean, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| the body that you file that complaint with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| We always just tell people to call 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| That's where all complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| about any number of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| hundreds of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| fellow Knoxvillians call 311 every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| to complain about a wide variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| things, and that's the best place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Most departments, Peter Ahrens heads it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| and there are different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| Some of them do the yard stuff, some of them do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| zoning stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Peter's so-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Laughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| He's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| And the other thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| if you call 311, you get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| complaint number? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Actually, the reason we tell people to call 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| is it creates a specific number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| for your complaint that then can be tracked through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| system until it is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| They will give you that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| and if you don't know what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| happened with it, you can always call back and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| I want to, again, thank everyone for showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| I think this has been a good workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| and I know Council, as Jeannie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| we have our work to do, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| continue with your emails and telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170810?start=3809)|
