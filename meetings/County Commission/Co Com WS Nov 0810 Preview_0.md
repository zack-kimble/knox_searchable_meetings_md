| 0:00:38| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| We have nine commissioners present, so we do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| Our first item is any amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| Does anyone have anything they would like to add to the agenda today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| Dr. Buchanan, I believe you have an item for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| Martha Buchanan, Director of Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=54)|
| 0:00:58| I would like to add a diabetes prevention grant to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| It's about a $169,000 grant to prevent diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| Where's the money coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| The money is coming from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| So it's pass-through money that's coming from the state to the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Is this something they do each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| This is our third year to receive this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=78)|
| 0:01:20| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| We'll add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Mr. Chairman, I would like to, is this an appropriate time to do withdrawals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| Can we do withdrawals at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| I would like to withdraw at this time or just put on suspension at 9.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| We're still working with Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| Is Frances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| I don't see Frances here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| She's over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| She's moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| About how much time do you think will, before you have your final information in, Frances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| Another two months, a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Do I have to put a time on this, Mr. Chairman, or just withdraw and bring it back anytime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| That and 1.02, we are still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| 1.02?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| Number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Number 22, so you're wanting to just go ahead and withdraw that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| Number 22 wants to withdraw the ordinance about the personnel policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| Was there a second one you wanted to withdraw to or just that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| Number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| Not 9.03?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=144)|
| 0:02:32| Question, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| I'm trying to understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| If it's withdrawn, is there a time limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| Mr. Law Director, is there a time limit if the sponsor chooses to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| I thought at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Well, I mean, you haven't had a first reading on the ordinance, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| No, we have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| So you should have a date specific as to when to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| If you're going to do it in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| I've researched this issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| There's not a lot of information, so it's going to require Frances to spend quite a bit of time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| This is not something that's readily available because it's not private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| So you may want to look at this, say, in January, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| I would just table it is what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| You want to table it until January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Table it until January would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| That item will be heard again in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| I would like to suggest a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| Number 3, number 6, number 7, number 8, number 9, number 10, number 11, 12, 13, 14, 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=216)|
| 0:04:03| Would anyone like to pull any of those off for consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Not a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| I need discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| So if there's no, we'll go ahead and have those as our consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| And, Commissioner Wright, you want to go ahead and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| If it's appropriate, anyone would like to hear things of the audit committee met this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| We may, before this meeting is over, have enough time to think of a thing or two we need to bring to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| Can we go ahead and add that as a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Audit committee discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Anything else that needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| Mr. Chairman, on the discussion item number 25, I'm not going to speak about that today because we're still in court litigation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| So we'll wait until court litigation gets over with and we'll bring it back at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| I think it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| So you want to defer it until January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Mr. Law Director, you think it would be appropriate to do it at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| So we'll defer that until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| So do I have a motion that we add these items to the agenda and that the agenda is set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Could I have a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| The first item is item number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| It is ratifying the Knotts County Mayor's appointment of a member to the Knotts County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=335)|
| 0:05:42| And who is that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Is Mr. Rice here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| I know that they told me they had a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| They should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| When they get here, I'll recognize them and we'll get the name of that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| So we'll go ahead and move to the next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| It's a resolution appointing an alternate member on the Knotts County Sheriff's Office Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=368)|
| 0:06:10| Let me ask Vice Chairman Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| At the last meeting, I understand there was a vote on this and there was not enough votes for an individual to get enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| With the need for six, the winner had to have six because Mr. McKenzie was here and then left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| So the winner did not have six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| The majority was not met, so we need to choose those come Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| Do we want to defer this until Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| Yes, let's just defer it until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Okay, we'll defer this until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| It's a resolution authorizing the Knotts County Purchasing Director to sell surplus personal property as needed for the Teachers Supply Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Mr. Holt, if you would enlighten us on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| Hugh Holt, Purchasing Director, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| The county has been asked to dispose of surplus property for the Knotts County Schools Teachers Supply Depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| and obviously return those funds back to the depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| It's no additional drain on our services to do that since it would typically just happen maybe two or three times a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| and it's a small amount of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Is this going to be through auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Is this going to be through bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Through online auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| What type of items are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| I will defer to Scott Bacon with the depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Thank you, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Scott Bacon, Knotts County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| In this particular instance, it's some display boards that we received from a donor that we distributed out to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| and just had an excess, but it very easily could be other equipment oriented supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| because we don't have the move down to Cedar Bluff, we simply don't have as much storage capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| And so when we have some of those issues come up, we would go this route to get the funding to purchase basic ed supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| What will happen with these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Will this just go into the general county fund or what will happen to these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| What would happen was we would have our online auction company keep these funds separate from the county funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| and the depot would receive a check from the auctioneer company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Hugh, how many schools do we have that are not being used right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| Because that's what's going to happen to the depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| It's just going away, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Yeah, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Before you move locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Yeah, actually we have an RFP on the street right now for the disposition of Oakwood Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| where the teacher depot was formerly housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Can you get us a list of the schools that we've got and the approximate value of what each of those unused schools is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| Yes, I can work with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| I believe I saw Mr. Thomas in the back of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Is there a motion to approve item number 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| It's a resolution approving the reorganization of the child support 4D program by transferring the duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| responsibilities, and funding of one administrative assistant to the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| effected November 22, 2010, resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| I did not put this on consent because I wanted to see if the Sheriff's Department wanted to weigh in on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| or if there was somebody here from juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| I don't have any issue with it, but if someone would like to explain to us what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| Heidi Garrett, 3323 Division Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| What this is, is this transferring one administrative assistant over to the sheriff's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| This person was put in juvenile court's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| but it probably should have gone as a transfer at the same time that those officers went over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| because she's kind of their support staff with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| With this employee transferring over, how does this affect the pension at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| Well, she's not a uniformed officer, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| She wouldn't be under the UOCC or UOP, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| Ms. Garrett, you might want to come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| Item 17 is a resolution approving Amendment 1 to a grant agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| with the Tennessee Department of Human Services for Child Support Enforcement Services, Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Could you give us just a brief synopsis of this, the monies involved, where it's coming from, and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| What that is is it's a state grant or state contract to pay for child support enforcement services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| and this employee that we're transferring, her funds and salary are in that budget from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| so it's amending that budget, pulling them out from juvenile court's contract to the Sheriff's Department contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Item 19 is a resolution creating a tax force to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| and assess the composition, structure, function, power, and authority of the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Yes, this is something that we've talked about, you know, from time to time, is having another look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| and maybe some fine-tuning of really what the composition of the Ethics Committee is as far as the members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| how the members are appointed to that committee, how long they serve on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| and then also what the scope of authority or the scope of examinations that the Ethics Committee would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=707)|
| 0:11:58| when things are referred to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| I'm not making any specific recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| I just think that we should, I mean, I have my own opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| but I think what we should do is just try to get some people together that wants to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| and then come back to the commission and say this is what the task force recommends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| and then the commission can make further changes that they deem worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I'm sorry, Commissioner Briggs, if you've provided this and I'm just not aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| Have you made a recommendation of how the task force is going to be composed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| No, what I really wanted to do was leave that open to this board to decide who would be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| You know, probably what we need to do is to have somebody from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| somebody from the sheriff's department, because those are people that have appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| have the authority now to make appointments there, and then someone from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| It could be bigger or smaller, and then maybe citizens, you know, citizens group also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| as a citizens representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I would support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Commissioner Briggs, could you Monday bring us your recommendation as to how this should be set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| I think it's a good idea too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| And then what we can do is once we have that committee or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| is that we can have public hearings on it also as we make our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| Of course, this will all be an open forum anyway, but I'll bring some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| I think a motion to defer this to Monday would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I'll allow Commissioner Briggs the opportunity to bring us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| So is there a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Item 20 is a resolution approving amendments to the Knox County Commission rules to rearrange the order of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| extend the deadline for the line item transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| and require the approval of the Commission Chair on items added to the agenda after the deadline, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Yeah, this was brought forth to the Rules Committee by suggestion of the Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| And if you look in your packet, you'll notice the few changes that it makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| It just kind of brings the meeting in order and gives it some continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| And it also allows for the Chairman to refuse to add a late agenda item if he so deems fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| So I think it's a good suggestion from the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Just by means of suggestion, in looking at our time, the efficient use of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| I've made these suggestions, for example, having our public forum around 145 on a rerium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| so that we can have a set time to do those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| The reason for the commission, and anyone can add anything to the agenda at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| but one of the issues that we were finding when I talked with our office was that people were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| coming in and bringing in items after the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| And it was creating some issues, you know, with the law department, with our office, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| And so if something needs to be added, we're definitely going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| But if it's something that perhaps could wait, then we might ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| or I might ask them to wait another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| So I'm not trying to dictate who gets on the agenda and who doesn't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| It's just that we want to try to adhere to our deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| And if something comes in after the deadline and you folks want to bring something up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| by all means, you all can put anything on the agenda that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| But I'm just trying to get people to know that there is some deadlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| and let's try to work within that as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Yes, just Item 905 also talks about line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| I just want to make the request we do have a proposal for three line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| They're all small dollar amounts to be considered at this month's meeting if that would be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| What was the discussion on the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| The line item transfers, the finance department wanted an extra Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| an extra week to get the line item transfers together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| and Jolie didn't have a problem with just adding that to the agenda at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| So in the resolution, it gives them an extra week to add their line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| So you're asking if these line item transfers come on the agenda today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| If that's possible, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Is there any objection to having these line items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| I don't see any objections, so we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| I'll distribute these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| So do we hear a motion for approval on Item 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Item 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| It's an ordinance amending Sections 2-581, 2-647, and 2-691 of the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| relative to contract modifications and emergency purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| This amends Ordinance 0-08-5-101, adopted June 23, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Mr. Holt, would you explain this to us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| What you have in front of you are a few changes to the county's current procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| The Procurement Subcommittee met last month and went over these changes in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| What they did short of it is you've got two changes relating to road and bridge projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1026)|
| 0:17:16| and the change order threshold, which was requested by our Public Works and Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| That's pages 2 and 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| There is another change on page 13 that's related to the use of the electronic commerce card in emergency situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1045)|
| 0:17:38| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Let me just ask you this now since you're here, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| Commissioner Wright, I won't give you the credit or the blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| We were talking about the P-card this morning, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Could you explain, we were discussing the pros and cons of the P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| Would you just explain it to us, as you did the other night or the other afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| about the Procurement Committee, the checks that are on those things now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| The supervision, I guess I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| There is, at a minimum, four sets of eyes looking at each transaction, sometimes up to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1092)|
| 0:18:20| These cards are monitored electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| They are restricted electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| There are personnel issues that we deal with with the cardholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1108)|
| 0:18:38| and those issues are addressed as well in our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| It's called the three-strike policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| This is probably, well, I say it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| it's the most transparent purchasing card program that you will see in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| I would be willing to bet on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| And it's on the county website, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| And all the data that exists inside of the SunTrust Bank reporting system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| is 100% searchable from the county's website by the person who made the transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| the department, the amount of the transaction, or the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Mister, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Mister Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I want to see if Commissioner Wright has anything to further question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| The question that I raised or the comment that I made this morning in the audit committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| was that over the last couple of days, and in particular yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| I had three people ask about doing away with e-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1179)|
| 0:19:50| How do we know where the money is being spent that's not being spent using the e-card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| I believe that to be a big question, especially if we use the e-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| We get money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| How much did we get back last year or in this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| This previous year it was over $130,000, and we're projecting close to $200,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1209)|
| 0:20:19| So to take transactions off of the county e-card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| and put it into some kind of paper check purchase order, we lose that percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1225)|
| 0:20:34| That's correct if that's what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| There are going to be a small number of transactions that are still not landing on the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| What we have done is we have consolidated what we call contract cards into a single card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| maybe for multiple contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Those transactions are still going to hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| but you're just going to have less number of cards that they land on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| Those that don't make it on a card will be on a purchase order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| which our county IT department is currently working on developing a searchable database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| that allows the citizens of the county to search those purchase orders the same way that they search P-cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1269)|
| 0:21:16| or electronic commerce cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| So you see the concern that I'm receiving from constituents is the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| having been here for two and a half years, I know that government moves slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| It takes a long time to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Well, sometimes a long time to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| But in this instance, within just a few weeks, we've eliminated a lot of E-cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1297)|
| 0:21:48| and the possibility of getting a rebate associated with it and having it on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| Who did you name, SunTrust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Yes, SunTrust is our bank for purchasing cards right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| So I would hope they don't have a dog in a fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| They just put on the Web whatever happens, which makes it easy for us to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| and maybe easy to look for lobster dinners or other purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1331)|
| 0:22:19| In a way, I want you to know I'm making fun of what may have happened to us in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| but it's a serious thing when people start asking you on Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| why are we doing away with E-cards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Is it so we can go to a paper trail which no one can find?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| Does that satisfy the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| Not that this is the end of the issue, but to me it's more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Obviously all the publicity has been on P-cards, E-cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| It's much more efficient than purchase orders and physical checks and those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| if there's enough supervision that the $200 lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| or the cruise charge to the P-card would get lost in the shuffle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| and not be noticed by supervisors and obviously the public and the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| And for the most part, those cards still will take care of the bulk of small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| and mundane purchases and field face-to-face transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| Mr. Wright, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I was going to add that it would be all right with me if everyone had an E-card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| because the rule says you misuse it, you're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Okay, so I guess what I'm wanting to pick at or dig at is costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| I know it's a feel-good thing to say we've all given back our P-cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| and we've renamed them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| We get to call them something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| They're still purchase cards, but we'll call them whatever we choose to this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| but what about the costs associated with doing away this group of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| that we've taken away the responsibility, I won't call it a privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| I mean it's part of their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| It was part of their job to do these purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| They're still going to have to make these purchases, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| We're not reducing our county budget by that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| so these widgets will have to be purchased somehow, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| And the field cards, for the most part, those were untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| The majority of the card reduction come in the consolidation of contract cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| where, for example, in purchasing we had 21 contract cards, now we have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1483)|
| 0:24:51| And what we did was we grouped those in categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| versus having an individual card attached to each contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| So we're not going to increase the number of purchase orders that we make as a result of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| Very minimal, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I think that pretty much answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| I recall seeing a study several years ago looking at the cost of making a purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| if you go through the purchase order request and it was very expensive to buy something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| as opposed to using some sort of electronic card or P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| And as Commissioner Wright pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| also you have a much more transparent trail when you're using electronic cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| So what you're really saying, we've just consolidated the cards into fewer hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| but we've not done away with any of the functions that the cards were serving previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Mr. Dean Rice has joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Dean, I want to go back to an earlier item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| and that is does the Mayor have a name for the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| Yes, Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| I apologize for not being here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| I was in a meeting with my boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Oh, not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| The Mayor would like to appoint Mr. Richard Bell to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| I have a letter for commission that talks about Mr. Bell's background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| and his active involvement in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| I think he is someone that will serve the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| and the people of Knox County very well in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Motion to approve Mr. Richard Bell as the Mayor's appointment to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Will that move to consent, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| Item 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| It's an ordinance amending Article 4 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| to add a new section 4.103 regarding standards and requirements for flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| This amends Ordinance 0-90-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990 as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| This is Ordinance 103 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Mr. Andrews, I'll go with you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| And Mr. Donaldson, if you want to make your way down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| I'm sure there will be a couple of questions for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| I think Commissioner Wright last month brought up a few questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| I'm not married to the plan as it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| but I certainly don't want to water it down to where it's ineffective for the codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| but I'd like to hear what the conversation is between Mr. Wright and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| Having talked to codes enforcement, we got into a discussion of what may turn out to be semantics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1667)|
| 0:27:58| He asked me, well, what's the difference between a flea market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| and then what if the person called their yard a public market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| Would it come under this same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| And then the conversation turned from the content to the content of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| What is flea market merchandise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| Is this produce that's grown on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| I mean, that's a roadside market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| So there's another name that's to be added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I think that we've had a problem of a certain location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| and I agree with it because I've driven by there and I didn't like the way it looked either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| We have to do, and I was quoted as saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| we have to do something to look at flea markets, public markets, roadside markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| whatever these transit things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| In fact, on the way back to this meeting this afternoon at the corner of Millertown and Loves Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1738)|
| 0:29:11| Oliver Smith's having a sale, I think, of handbags and watermelons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1751)|
| 0:29:23| On one side, we can make light of what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| On the other side of the issue, though, is something has to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| to address four or five issues that we had before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| One was, is the ownership of the property knowledgeable of what's taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| And maybe I just named one that's not that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| The second one was, everyone has to have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Well, come to find out, I think at the one on Clinton Highway, maybe we have a vendor's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| But still yet, blocking the right-of-way and the road and making a traffic hazard is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| The structures that are at this location are questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| Structures at a flea market, probably a flea market is just something that comes and goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| so there may not be any structures, which then gets into the setback and vegetation that we're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1816)|
| 0:30:25| no, we're demanding be placed if you're going to have a five-acre flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| I'm really to the point that I don't know exactly what to say we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| and since someone asked the other day that we do an in-depth, over the next three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| review of these kinds of codes relating to corner lots and swimming pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| and lots of other things that maybe need to be looked at in code for code enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1849)|
| 0:30:58| And we need the people that are going to do the code enforcement involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Maybe these roadside markets, flea markets, and other situations such as this, we need to form a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| we need to form a group, hillside task forces going out of business, reconstitute them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| Don't be so sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| And this is one of the things that really needs to be considered in a comprehensive overall look at Knox County code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| Mr. Donaldson, any response to what Commissioner Wright had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| I mean, do you think that there are any, and I guess the codes folks too, a task force to look at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| What are your thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Well, back in June, the county commission asked the planning commission to make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| regarding regulations that would apply to flea markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| We presented it back to you in September, and you've been dealing with it since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| There's no problem having a task force to look at this if you want to broaden the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| but we worked closely with Roy and his shop in putting these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| We examined ordinances from around the country, both at the city and the county level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| to come up with the recommendation that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| At the last meeting, there was specific mention of the off-street parking, lighting, signs, landscape screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| regulations where we are simply making reference to regulations that already exist in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| In each one of those, there are regulations, and we simply make a reference to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| So taking that away, we're simply setting out regulations that require a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| require a site plan to be a part of that permit, require permission of the owner to submit for that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| Establish a minimum parcel size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| We require that the property have frontage on an arterial or collector road to accommodate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| The current definition in the Knox County Zoning Ordinance refers to occasional or periodic sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| so the regulations specify what that is as to no more than three days per week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| and that they have to display their goods in keeping with the site plan that has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| So the regulations are really pretty simple that we've put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Mr. Braden, do you see any unintended consequences to this ordinance as it sits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2017)|
| 0:33:46| Do you have issues with the ordinance at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I mean, I don't want to give you something that you can't work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| I don't want to restrict commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| but also what we had we needed to deal with and we didn't have the teeth to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| Roy Braden, building official, 400 Main Street, Suite 547.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| I think this would be fine except in the interpretation of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| where people are setting up on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| If that's what this is intended for and we interpret it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| then everything in the whole county will be shut down except for three garage sales a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| That's what's allowed for yard sales and garage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| You know, this is really expanding on what Commissioner Wright had to say about what's a flea market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| what's a public market, what's a yard sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| And this is something that I would have a concern about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| I don't know if it would fall under this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| but it's the people who are standing out there, particularly at the interstate ramps where you come off the ramps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| either selling some little flower and they're running across traffic to someone who stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| or they're just out there begging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| I don't know what the beggars are selling, but it's the people that are selling flowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| and put up a little thing there and they run out or they're selling a little newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| Not that we need to stop them from doing that, but I mean, I just about hit a fellow the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| It was a beggar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| They weren't selling anything where they cut across my lane of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| I was on the left-hand side because somebody was going to give them a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| and they stopped when the traffic was flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| Are they selling something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| No, that's a traffic issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| That's a law enforcement issue with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| And then what we had on, I mean, and I don't, I mean, I understand there's an agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| if I'm not mistaken, people can sell on agricultural zoning on the side of the road and have ag zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| Is that true, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Yeah, within the agricultural zone district there is a provision for road stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| so that a farmer can sell produce from his farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| Does it have to be produced on that farm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| There is language to that effect, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| But currently the ordinance defines flea markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| and establishes flea markets as a permitted use in three of the zone districts, C-A, C-B, and C-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| So establishing regulations is the next, just the next step to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| But, Mr. Brayton, you see it as shutting down produce not produced on the farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| and things like that on these roadside produce stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Do you see it shutting those down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Possibly, if that's how we interpret this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I think this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I think MPC's done a good job with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| If you're just going to say that a flea market is five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| and we actually have someone come in and go through all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| I think this is a good amendment to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| But if it's interpreted of shutting everything else down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| then that would be a problem and questions that we need to answer in interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| I'd like to defer this until Monday if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| And so I'd like to meet with Roy and sit down with him for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Let me ask you a couple of questions too, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| I was going home the other day and on Chapman Highway there was a guy there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| who was selling steaks from a refrigerated truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| Is that what you would consider like a roadside market type thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| or it was like, you know, ribeye steaks and this kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| You see him from time to time, but he was pulled off the road there on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| In all roadside markets that are actually legal, it's just like it was said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| It has to be grown on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Anything that is not grown on the property in an ag zone and actually a CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| maybe Mark said some other zone, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| But that's very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| There's not many legal roadside stands out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| So that was the illegal activity, I believe, that needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| I think a whole different set of amendments would have to come to regulate those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2275)|
| 0:38:03| And there was a couple of abandoned car lots there near Hendron's Chapel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| and there was someone set up over there selling rugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Would that be considered illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| I think that the questions come that Commissioner Wright brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| did they have permission to be on the property, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Number two, are they out of the road, right of the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| You know, it becomes a traffic hazard and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| So I think those are the things that maybe a different amendment might be proposed that it may even allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| But I think that this amendment to the ordinance is probably what maybe that was intended for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| is to take care of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| So we sort of go around in a circle saying that what we're trying to regulate will have some unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| The biggest thing that I see our problem being is that this business comes and goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| Those that really truly come and go won't be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| It's those that try to have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| And what I'm now looking at is I have had one call from another, I'll call flea market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| that is a charitable group and they lease a piece of property for a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| and their $5 a week goes toward seasonal year-end charitable work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2368)|
| 0:39:39| And for them to come up with a site plan, they would need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| I think anyone that's going to be in a business ongoing needs a safe place to transact this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2383)|
| 0:39:56| But for it to be a minimum of five acres to be landscaped, something else that was hiding in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2396)|
| 0:40:08| They need parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| They need to be off the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| But then we're going to restrict them to three days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| And this gentleman was saying that there are people at this location every day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| It's just that it's different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| So this location is a seven-day-a-week flea market with no permanent structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| See, that's another thing that I think we need to look at is we don't need a run-down shantytown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2432)|
| 0:40:41| We need a nice-looking place for people to go and do things that are kind of low-end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2441)|
| 0:40:50| So on the one hand, we need to control something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We've got an example of what we need to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| The thing that we need to do is do it in such a way that we don't have the unintended consequences, Mr. Brayden is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| as most people, except for three yard sales a year, would be out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Mr. Brayden, so what I'm hearing is that MPC's recommendations for these large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| more commercial-style flea markets, that's acceptable for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| Do you agree with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| I think it's a good amendment if that's what we're trying to amend the ordinance to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| I think this is good legislation or rules that we could go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| But if it's intended to regulate everything else we've talked about, I don't think that's a good intent for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| So do you agree with the activity that's sort of taking place that some kind of working group needs to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| and start to form policy recommendations for the other types of flea markets that are more, I guess, transient or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2512)|
| 0:42:03| Yes, sir, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I think there's a lot of things in the ordinance that needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| And I think there's a workshop going on today at 4 o'clock and there's one next Monday at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| And I think those are really good things that's going to be happening for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Okay, I'll be fine with it as long as you're in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| We have a motion to defer until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Was there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| We'll defer it until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| Let's go ahead and take Dr. Buchanan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| We don't have an actual resolution, but she told us it was passed through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Would you explain that to us again, Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| Well, I guess we need to assign that a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So let's just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| If it's okay, let's move this to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| But you've told us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| But if you'll give us the proper paperwork, we can assign it a number and have it done properly on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| So do I hear a motion we defer this to Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| As we move into the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2586)|
| 0:43:18| Yes, we need to add Commissioner Brown's resolution honoring the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| I don't think we added that, did we, at the beginning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| No, we also didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| Yes, let's go ahead and read Commissioner Brown's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| I move that we suspend the rules to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Let's read this one into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| This is resolution 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| It's honoring All in Home Baptist Church as it prepares to celebrate 150 years of continuous ministry to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| That's a sesquicentennial, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| See, I learned a new word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| We're all going to learn to say that word, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Of course, if your folks will be here, we'll make sure they're properly recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| On the discussion items, let me begin by saying that our next meeting on Monday will be at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| We've met with the officials at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| They've been very gracious to us and are rolling out the red carpet for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| I think it's going to be a very good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| We'll meet at noon, and that's when we'll have the chairman's lunch, and the folks at Fulton and the school board will be presenting some information to us about the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| We'll have an opportunity to meet with some of the students, and then we'll begin our commute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| There is no beer board meeting, and so we will meet at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| After our commission meeting, we will come back here for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| So I just want to make sure everyone knew that at noon there will be parking in front of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| They will be there waiting for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Members of the ROTC will direct us where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| And so we would ask that you be there before noon, but we'll be meeting in the library, and we'll have our lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| and then we'll go into the auditorium for our meeting at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| So, again, Fulton High School, Monday, 2 o'clock meeting, but 12 o'clock for the lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| I have a resolution for the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Will that be for this coming Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Yes, it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| I may tweak it a bit, Commissioner, because from the time we spoke just today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| they gave me some additional information, so I was kind of flying blind when I wrote the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| You also have the commission budget for the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| I promised that we would give you the commission budget, so you have that to look over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| And any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| I haven't had a chance to look over it yet, but we'll be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| feel free to ask any questions that you might have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Mr. Chairman, where are we having lunch at Fulton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| It's going to be in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Okay, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| I was afraid it was going to be in the school cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Well, we talked about that, but because they're so tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| they were afraid that we might knock out a couple of kids from eating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| and I said that would be the worst thing that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Mr. Dinella would love to have a student that was displaced because of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| I mean, it would be on the front page the next day, so we want to make sure we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| I'm just kidding, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| But, no, they said that because of the tightness of the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| it would be better for us to go in the library, so we're going to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| and we'll have lunch brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| I'm all in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Our discussion item 26 on Carter Elementary, is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Let me begin the discussion by just saying this, that I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| We have had the school board has voted on this three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| We have had numerous meetings in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I don't know that having more meetings is really going to change anybody's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| I don't know that, but my sense is that I believe that most of you have made up your minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| and you know what you want to do with regards to Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| As I see it, and we're not going to vote today, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| but I wanted to have this as a discussion to see if you wanted to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| I believe that there are two issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Issue A is we vote to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| $5 million has been withheld from the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| $5 million could be released to go to the schools and the renovation will begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| The second is that this commission says, no, we believe that we need to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| If we build a new school, what will the cost be and where will the revenue stream come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| You're looking at probably an additional, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| I believe the figure that the school board used was an additional $10 million perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| because part of the $5 million was going to be going to Carter Middle and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| So, if this commission decides to build a new Carter Elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| there must be a revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Where is the money coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| One option could be to refer it to the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| Maybe this school isn't built next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Maybe it is the next year as we look at different scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| But I bring this up because, to me, it has become kind of a football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| We've gone back and forth, back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| I don't know that we need to go back and forth anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| This is my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| But if you folks feel that you would be ready to vote on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| we'll put it on the agenda for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| If you don't feel you're ready to vote on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| I'm just looking for the will of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| But I, as for me, I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| And I feel like that the community needs something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| They need to know what this commission is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| But I know, Commissioner Briggs, you've got your light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| but I wanted to defer to the 8th District Commissioner, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| If you have anything, I'll get to you if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| And Commissioner Anders, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| I have taken the input given to me by the folks that live in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| I think that they've done the best they could to impress upon me the need for a new campus at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2900)|
| 0:48:33| I believe that the recent school board election was probably decided by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| and not just the Carter community but by the entire 8th District as to who might be the school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2920)|
| 0:48:48| I believe that elective race was somewhat decided upon the lines of whether or not Carter Elementary should be renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2928)|
| 0:49:00| or whether Carter Elementary ought to be a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| I say all this because I'm a Gibbs guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| I don't know that I knew Carter Elementary was around behind Carter Middle two and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| Since then, I've been there several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| I've come to know the people quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| In an effort to get the rest of the story, I said I'd learn to speak school board if it killed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| So I've been to school board meetings, I think, the last four months, but maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| I've been to school board meetings and workshops both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| I've been to supper with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| I've been to the movies with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| And I believe that a lot of the school board new members had an opinion of Carter Elementary before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=2989)|
| 0:50:01| before election, that it may be difficult for me to understand what's happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| But all of that's an aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Carter Elementary is a location that's been brought up by the school board at least four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3013)|
| 0:50:24| At one point in time, it was such an issue that, let's see, a million four was spent for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3024)|
| 0:50:36| It must have been a belief that a new school, that a new structure was necessary at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| Since then, I believe it's been back to the top of the heap, was to be funded, and that funding was moved away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3042)|
| 0:50:51| And all of those things occur before our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| Now we're speaking for the last few months about Carter Elementary in our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3057)|
| 0:51:07| And the biggest thing about what's going to happen to Carter Elementary is being decided not on whether they need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3067)|
| 0:51:16| deserve it, have been offered it, and it withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| I've come to the realization in my mind that Carter Elementary was built in the 30s, and that's no mark against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| It was a good, fair, decent, strong structure on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| Since then, it's been added on to at least three times, maybe four times, and those have all been additions, no renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| The thing that happened, though, was it built across a low spot on soil that is fairly moist toward a pile of rock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3105)|
| 0:52:00| which in the current plan, as before, says we're going to spend three-quarters of a million dollars on site preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| I guess that's to get over that rock and around to the parking lot that's going to be a part of this new school location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| And let me pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| The new school location is this renovated site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| Looking at the documentation, it's just a six-acre place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| Carter Elementary is located on a six-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| By the time we get a new parking lot and add some possibly four classrooms and new central office outside the existing walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3152)|
| 0:52:43| the site gets even smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| It's landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Something that's not before us right now and something that really I haven't spoken to in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| if Carter gets a school that people can attend, it draws some out of homeschooling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3174)|
| 0:53:03| It draws some out of private schooling because right now everyone in the community knows it's a bad structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3183)|
| 0:53:19| Talking about mold, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| The first day of school there was a big deal on mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Since then some flooring has been taken up and I don't know whether it's been replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| I'm not an expert on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| All I'm doing is saying what people talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| The thing where I was really headed right then was Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| We're looking at Midway Road and we're going to put in a business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| and we're not thinking that it's going to expand anything on the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| I know it's a big deal about whether or not new schools are built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| because when you build a new school it should be for a population that does not currently exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| But to have a policy that is so constructed based on the environment or the lay of the land at Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3242)|
| 0:54:17| I've come to the firm belief that a new school needs to take place or needs to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| The biggest thing that concerns me about the last two or three sessions of commission and school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| is that it has been treated like a football, that we have bounced it back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| and I believe that each time that we talk about it we somewhat get lost in the high weeds of football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3275)|
| 0:54:45| Maybe school board does not understand our concern about the safety of what's being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| Maybe we don't understand the need that they have of keeping their budget intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3292)|
| 0:55:02| The last two meetings of school board, workshop and the regular session, I spoke at both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3302)|
| 0:55:11| All I have asked for is that they reconsider if it would be possible for us to do something different for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3311)|
| 0:55:21| I believe that one school board member has maybe presented that somewhat in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| do we need to get school board and county commission together to talk about that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3326)|
| 0:55:38| That if there needs to be a new school at Carter and we already have $2 million in the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| and that's all that's being spent on this building out there is $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| or $2,700,000 or less than three, whatever number you want to pull out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| What does it take to get to the school building that could possibly be built in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| and could we wait a year or so and do the right thing because the property out there is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3364)|
| 0:56:15| I know that there's concern at the other schools that are currently undergoing renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| and there are two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| There's no property available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| The schools are built on a rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| They don't have drainage issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Cedar Bluff and Powell, the two that were opened and looked at just this past spring or summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3393)|
| 0:56:42| are excellent renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| There's also a lot of tear down at those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Nothing is being taken away at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| We're just putting a coat of paint, moving the transformer, building a parking lot, adding air conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3414)|
| 0:57:04| I sometimes get to the point that I don't know what all is going to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| because every time I say something, something might be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Are we getting sprinklers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Are we in compliance right now by fire code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| That was the question I asked in front of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Then do we get sprinklers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Well, maybe we'll get something that blesses us so that we'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And the drainage issue, something's been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Well, maybe we'll put a swale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| That's a hillside slope development term there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| Maybe we'll get a swale on the upper side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Well, the building is just a roadway away from the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Where are we going to put the swale if we take away the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| This is something that has taken place over months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| when all it took for a new school in the southwest sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| was for two or three people to get together, one or two to disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| and two days later it was an acceptable process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| We need to be able to provide average facilities in the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| and the average facility that this renovation will provide in the Carter community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| will be substandard when it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| The room sizes will be all for small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| I'll prepare what I have seen and heard from the community, from school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| from what I've had to say, from what I've looked at in the media over the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| and try to get that in a format where maybe we can look at it to make this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| if that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| The biggest thing about it is, though, that the people in Carter say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| this has just been a political exercise on some, well, just say it on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3539)|
| 0:59:09| To try to do something to help them when everyone knew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| back when the southwest sector school was introduced, being new and servicing 750 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| that maybe will exist in three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| that nothing will be done for Carter because it's in Sevier County or Jefferson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| we just don't know which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| I appreciate the time to ramble on about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| This has become a cause with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| It needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| There is a significant need for a new school building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| and we need to search every possible way to provide average education at Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3586)|
| 0:59:55| before we get into some other things which are really good ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| that affect Knox County's school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Commissioner, I share the same thought process that Carter does need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| And, you know, before the school board voted the first time, we disagreed with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| We asked them to look at it with the new school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| And the numbers were the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| Disappointingly so, but the numbers were the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| And I think if we gave them $15 million to build a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| I don't think they're going to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| They've decided their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| And I don't know what else we as a commission can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| and I'd like to hear from somebody that does, because their mind is made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| They have an eight to one vote, both votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| One of them actually had three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I thought two of them were unanimous and one was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| It's not good for the people that want to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| The numbers are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Is there anything else this commission, I mean, I think they need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| I think they deserve a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| But is there anything else that you think this, we can't give them the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| but if we gave them $50 million, they're not going to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| And so, you know, I don't know what else we can do to put our opinion out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| other than I would love to have the magic, wave the magic wand, and there would be a school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| You know, really my sentiments are similar to Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| is that if the school board came back and said that on their list of priorities is that having a new school was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3691)|
| 1:01:39| I would vote in a minute for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| It's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| We would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| But I think when they look at all of their priorities, they said there's other schools that are old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| there's other schools that are older, there's other priorities that have to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| Again, I also don't think what more we can do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| When the chairman mentioned, well, we need to decide are we going to build a new school or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| I don't think that's our decision to make, quite frankly, from the way I understand the court ruling a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| and our charter as to the, and the state charter for that matter, state constitution as to the duties of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| and the duties of the commission, that we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| We can give them more money, but we can't tell them how to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| And there's actually, I think, been three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| There was two unanimous votes to renovate, and then there was the recent eight-to-one vote to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| And, I mean, we can send it back to them again, I guess, but it's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| I talked to one of the ex-chairmen of the school board last night on the phone about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| I've talked to the present chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| I really don't think they're going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| I mean, we can send it back a fourth time, but I don't think it's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| And I agree with the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| I think we need to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Really, to me, what the vote would be is not whether to build a new school or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| it's whether to give them the funds to renovate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| And I've talked to some people that live out in the Carter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| and they actually asked me, they said, don't vote for the funds, you know, deny them the five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| And even if we have to do this for a year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| it will then force the school board's hands to make the recommendation to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3803)|
| 1:03:32| But the more I thought about that, I don't think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| We've already heard there may be a mold issue in the present school that they say they can be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| It's not a good facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| It may not be a healthy facility the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| And if we vote to deny those funds for them to renovate the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| we're basically holding the children hostage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| And we're saying that we're going to keep them in an unhealthy environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| until the school board does what the community wants it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| And I don't think that's a good idea either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| I talked to one of the parents that has two kids out there, and she says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| are they going to go to this school for another four years in an environment that I think everyone says is not a healthy environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3846)|
| 1:04:15| Just so we can get a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| She says, I really don't want to sell my child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| and hold my child hostage to try to get the new school by putting them in a bad environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| So I really see what we do is we're either going to vote to give them the funds to renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| or just let it sit and do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| But I don't think sending it back to the school board again to ask them to vote on it again is going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| And I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| I'd like to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| I guess I'll start out with how Commissioner Briggs ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| In terms of process, this issue came before us, I mean, I guess in completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| I think the school board presented a full resolution to us, and we did some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| So I guess, Mr. Law Director, what is the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Can we have the original resolution introduced at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| Can we have it added to the agenda at this point and potentially vote on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| Well, the only action the commission ever took on this was to withhold the monies for Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3920)|
| 1:05:28| So the bottom line is you either put those monies back or you retain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| That's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| And in terms of just how the overall process works, as you know, capital improvement projects are aspirational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| You allocate a certain amount to the school board, and once that money changes hands, it's over in terms of your power and authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| Regardless, and I'm not ever asserting this, but even if the chair of the school board stood there and said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| you give us the money, we'll spend it on Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Once they get it, they can turn around and say, no, we changed our mind, we're going to spend it elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| But in terms of how to get it before us again, can we pull that original resolution back at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| We could suspend the rules and add anything you want to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| So I'm probably going to come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| We talked about political football, and I think that reference was given on a couple of occasions, and it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3980)|
| 1:06:29| But we were playing football with, you know, a soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| They didn't want to play football with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| They voted 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| And we said, no, take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| And we, you know, I heard it called a line item veto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| It was probably a little worse than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| I mean, within a line item, we carved out a piece of it and sent that back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| So we're doing all the kicking and the tackling and the face-masking here in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| It's been us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Then they sent it back to us, and we said, well, no, wait on another commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4026)|
| 1:07:12| I mean, another school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Now it's coming back a third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| And I listened to, I think it was school board member Fugate that talked about, you know, it was unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4036)|
| 1:07:25| It really was unfair for us to send it back, in her opinion, to send it back to the school board because you're new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4045)|
| 1:07:35| That's basically what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| You guys are new, so we're going to send it back to you again, hoping for another outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| And I tend to agree with her in the fact that that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| That's why we sent it when we sent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| And even with that, with all of that, their body, their elected body, who has rights and privileges and powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4069)|
| 1:07:57| came back and said, eight to one, that no, this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| So whether we like it or not, and that's really what I talked about initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| is us trying our best to stay in our lanes, not play political football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| We were the aggressors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| We were the ones that kind of started this issue, this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4098)|
| 1:08:29| So I'm going to, at this point, ask to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| and have the capital improvement plan funded at its original level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| We have a motion first to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Okay, let's roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Will this bring this up, just put this on the agenda for Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Is that what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Well, I think what Commissioner McKenzie wants to do is to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| You want to put forth a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| We'll vote on that motion from the workshop position, but it will not be formally done until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| But this will, is that what you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| You don't want to add it to the agenda for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| Yeah, the first vote is to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| So if you want to suspend the rules, you will vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| If you don't, you'll vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4167)|

| 1:09:37| Commissioner Owenby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4177)|

| 1:09:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Commissioner Brown votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4193)|

| 1:09:58| Commissioner Shouse votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| So the rules are suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Yes, so I'm going to hate to put someone from the school board on the spot here, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| we could, because it was more than Carter, if someone could come up and give a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| brief, okay, I see Dr. McIntyre hiding behind the camera there, it doesn't have to be you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| but if someone could come up and give a really brief kind of synopsis of what the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| resolution was and what all it funded, that would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4229)|
| 1:10:43| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Our address is 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner, I believe the resolution from the school board the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| day was the Knox County Board of Education would respectfully request that the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| Commission fully fund the Knox County Schools Capital Improvement Plan for fiscal year 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| through 13 by appropriating an additional $5 million for capital improvements for fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| year 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| And as I think we've talked about in the past, the $5 million project for Carter campus includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| a new middle school gymnasium, work on the site to improve the traffic flow and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| sort of thing, and then about $2.9 million for a major renovation at Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4290)|
| 1:11:36| School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| That would include new classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| That would include a new entrance, what is now the side entrance of the building, new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| administrative offices, a new secure entrance, and also then renovation to the current existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4307)|

| 1:12:20| do to the Carter Elementary facility to create an appropriate and functional learning environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Okay, so I'd like to move that we fully fund the capital improvement plan by adding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| additional $5 million that we took out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Motion is made and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| I agree with Commissioner Andrews and Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| We need a new school out at Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| I wasn't here when the football started passing backwards and forwards, but that has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| a concern of mine, and I understand that we can't tell them how to spend the money, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| I'm not suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| What I'm saying is that I feel that they need a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| I don't agree with their position on just renovating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| Now, we can argue backwards and forwards, and I'm not telling them they can renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| all they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| They can renovate with the $10 million that they already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| If we're not going to Carter Elementary, the Carter community has been promised a new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| for nearly 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| The land was purchased over six years ago for the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| If we're not going to build on that new school site, then we need to sell the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| If we're not going to build a new school and all we're going to do is renovate and keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| renovating every six, eight, ten years, then we might as well sell that land and put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| back on the tax rolls, let somebody develop it so we can get tax money out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| And that's pretty much all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| Mr. Brawls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| Commissioner Wright, I want to say how much I appreciate what you've done to help us understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4443)|
| 1:14:11| the situation at Carter and how you've advocated for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| I think you've done a really good job for them and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4456)|
| 1:14:25| My feeling is that we just can't tell the school board what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| That's not our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| And if we do come up with extra money and we give them $10 million, then they will do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4475)|
| 1:14:43| renovations to Carter and then they'll start on the renovations on the remaining schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| that desperately need renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| If we were only looking at this in isolation, it might be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| But there's a whole list of schools that desperately need renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| And I think the school board has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| I know Commissioner Wright was at the school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| I don't know if anybody else listened to the meeting or watched it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| but the school board was very clear about what they expect us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4517)|
| 1:15:26| And I think we need to do this and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4526)|
| 1:15:35| I want to get to Commissioner Norman and you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| But, Dean Rice, I would like for you, if you would, does the mayor have a position on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| If so, could you explain what the mayor's and the administration's view on Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| The mayor is upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| He'd be happy to come down and talk about this directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| but he instructed me to talk to you if he was not out of his meeting yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| And this did come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| The mayor understands, has met a number of times on this issue, has toured the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| has spoken with both the school system as well as a number of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| and recognizes the separations, of course, between the bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| But he does feel strongly that the people who have spoken most clearly on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| are the people of the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| And they've been speaking on this issue for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| And as Commissioner Olinby said, the land does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| And, Commissioner Rice, you made that point very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| It does make it different from other situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| The mayor would like to find a way that would be able to build a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| Now, there's constraints there in terms of budgets and bonded indebtedness that we don't want to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4602)|
| 1:16:50| However, if going forward there is a way to include this in discussions of the upcoming capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| that would give time to actually look at building the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| To simply say the school board has told the commission what to do and the commission has to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| would not be something that the mayor would necessarily agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| from either a procedural standpoint or the best interest of the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| Any questions for Mr. Rice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Let's move on to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Doug Dillingham, can you come down and give me some information on these figures and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| I'm assuming you might be the right man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| You or Bob Thomas or Dr. McIntyre are the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4653)|
| 1:17:42| This was going to be your project and whatnot, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| First of all, Doug Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| I'm supervisor of facilities and construction, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| How much leeway do we have with the money on this as far as if you run to something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| I mean, these figures that you've come up with, if we run to anything, we don't have anything else to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| You might come back and ask for more money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| We have based our estimates or guesstimates, you might say, on current construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| And we do have contingency money that's built into this just like we do on every other project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| You mean like a 10% cushion or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| It's not quite 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| We've got roughly a couple hundred thousand dollars built into this $5 million budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| to try to take care of any unforeseen concerns that we might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| Normally, we find those buried underground when we start moving dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| So in this situation, we might find some within the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| But that money is put there for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Can you explain to me just real quick about the heat and air, what you're wanting to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| We're basically going to replace what is there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| The existing gymnasium that's being used by the middle school is not conditioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| so we'll be adding conditioning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Plus, we'll be upgrading the air conditioning throughout the entire facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| You know, I go back to what Dr. Briggs was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| You know, you don't want to hold these children hostage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| We don't want political football with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| But, you know, here's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| We've got Southwest Middle School down here, Commissioner Wright, down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| and those kids are in a great school where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| And you've got the people up here in Carter School right now, and they're suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| They're getting sick, but yet we're taking care of Southwest School first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| Why don't we take care of what needs to be taken care of with our kids that have the more needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| This morning I started off the day with an audit committee meeting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| and when that was over I went to Gibbs Elementary, which had Veterans Day recognition today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4792)|
| 1:20:03| There was one man that I spoke to that had traveled this morning from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| so he could sit for 45 minutes with his grandson, have a bowl of chili,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| listen to the fifth grade kids sing a few patriotic tunes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| and then he was driving back to Nashville because he had to go to work tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| One of the people, though, that was there spoke to me about he was retired from the post office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4825)|
| 1:20:37| and his daughter or daughter-in-law had encouraged him with his knowledge to become a substitute teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4837)|
| 1:20:47| and he said he did it for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| and he named the four schools that he substituted at, one of them being Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4851)|
| 1:21:00| and he said he only substitute taught one year because after every week of being at Carter Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4860)|
| 1:21:13| he had the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Now, that to me is an outlying point of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4876)|
| 1:21:25| The most important points of data that we have before us is the fact that we are not the aggressor in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4885)|
| 1:21:35| The school systems presented through the mayor to Knox County's funding authority, us, a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4895)|
| 1:21:46| which we can either approve or not, and on this particular one, it was almost approved, wasn't it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| except for me saying, which number are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| I complained about the fact that Carter Elementary, for 20 years, has been needing a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| Otherwise today, maybe not today because the scheduling process couldn't have taken place yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| I think they want to build a gymnasium before they build some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| You've got a big, we've got to do this before we can do that, before we can do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| There's a big list of things you have to do in a certain order to get to where we need to be to be exactly like we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4944)|
| 1:22:32| except it's going to have new air conditioning and a new central office and an elevator and paint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| and whatever else it's going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| I didn't complain about Chilhowee, and there's actually, I think, $3 million being spent at Chilhowee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| Really didn't say anything about the Southwest Sector School, except I kept referring it to a new school out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| I kept referring to it as a new school out west whenever its title is Southwest Sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4976)|
| 1:23:07| I viewed it at first being a disparate treatment of Carter, and those people truly believe that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| that they are being treated different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| When you look at the location that I just named a moment ago, Gibbs Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| we don't have the knowledge about how it was funded, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| It wasn't funded by school board, it was funded by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5009)|
| 1:23:38| I've probably got a note here somewhere that talks about how was Hardin Valley funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5018)|
| 1:23:46| which is a later school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| or how was the Pal debt eliminated so that some building could take place there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5029)|
| 1:24:00| I don't know the answer to all those things, but I do know the answer to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| The court ruling was not a court ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| The court ruling was the, help me Mr. Law Director, it was the blessing of an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| Arranged that between county commission and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| No one, well maybe the school system was going to sue county commission, but it never got that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5066)|
| 1:24:34| They arrived at an agreement amongst themselves, and then to make it official it was blessed, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5074)|
| 1:24:42| Yes, essentially sir, it's a consent order where the parties by mutual assent make an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| and the court will then accept it and enter an order accordingly, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| So to say that we, county commission, are trying to force upon them something that they don't want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5092)|
| 1:25:01| really I'm not wanting to do that, I just want to discuss with them the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| And I believe I need to read a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| They had every opportunity to send it back to us with the detailed information stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| they have the funds for a new Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| That's a dissenting school board person that wrote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| And I don't know that dissension the other night was 8-1, was it 7-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5128)|
| 1:25:36| I was told it was 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| It was 8-1 to put the $5 million back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| Okay, so see, we're not talking about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| We're talking about different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| I was at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| I've been to all the meetings of the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| A fellow commissioner was there somewhere else across the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Every time he walked up to me I had to turn around and go the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| This is more than serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| This is the direction that Knox County is headed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| the relationship of the school board and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| I think that we all have been here for at least two and a half years except for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| Oh, we've all been here for two years maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Oh, we've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| You've been here longer than a couple of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| And some have been here longer than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| The thing that bothers me about saying we, new commission, new county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5199)|
| 1:26:47| are waiting on new school board, we are not really new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| We've had some time to look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| and figure out what needs to happen, where we're headed, what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| Things will have a normal transition going forward for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5218)|
| 1:27:05| I believe the statement that was made the other night by one of the school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| that didn't appreciate this being pushed off on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| they had campaigned on those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| They knew where this was headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| Some of them made statements a few months ago that they're unwilling or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| well, I shouldn't go that far, that maybe they've changed their mind, which is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5249)|
| 1:27:36| The thing is, though, that we've never really met head on with what are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| We've twisted one here just a second ago about the 8-1 vote, about which vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| They had several votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| And then I have, after the fact, after that meeting, an email saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| well, maybe commission and school board needs to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| As I said at school board, this is about average education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| If we can't afford average education, then we can't afford above and beyond programs either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5286)|
| 1:28:15| We have to work toward looking for funding, especially if the community of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5295)|
| 1:28:25| has sufficient sway with the mayor to say we need to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| Now, if you all tell me no, if school board says no, if the mayor says no, then it's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5313)|
| 1:28:43| But right now we've not got to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| I know a lot of people have brought up this, that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| But this is a several-month process that's taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| and I don't think that an up-or-down vote is really going to solve the issues at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5337)|
| 1:29:06| We need to be working a little bit harder about finding out what all the facts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| and what the votes have been and really what is it that the school board is looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| because this email interjects a question in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5357)|
| 1:29:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| Just a couple of comments and then a question for Dean Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| One thing that disturbs me in the discussion is that this body has not met with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| and we're in this room together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| We talk about the issue, and then the school board, of course, talks about the issue at a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5391)|
| 1:29:58| It seems like that's a fairly inefficient way to handle a problem that we're both very much involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5398)|
| 1:30:08| And I agree with several of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| It's not our authority to tell the schools what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| It's our job to fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| But without getting into the whole legal issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| there's a longstanding bit of trouble that exists between this body and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5428)|
| 1:30:39| This is decades old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| And so when you get in a problem that's as entangled as this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| it really does seem like what are we doing talking about this separately from the body at hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5448)|
| 1:30:56| I mean, how can that even take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| How can we make a judgment without being in the room with these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| And I don't know how that takes place, whether it could take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| but that's one disturbing aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| I think that as a school board member, if I was sitting in that seat of a school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| I would certainly want to build a new school at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| And I would do everything that I could to build that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| given everything that I know about what's going on there with the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| all those issues and problems and such that Mr. Wright has outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5491)|
| 1:31:39| So these are, you know, I just think we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| there's lots of evidence that there's a turf war going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| The turf war or the battle between authority is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| I don't think we're solving anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| We're still just wrestling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Now I do like the fact that I really did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| I'm very attentive to what Dean just had to say a few minutes ago about procedural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5525)|
| 1:32:13| there's possibly some procedural avenues in terms of future capital plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5533)|
| 1:32:22| So that's what I'm, I just think there's a way to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| And I think there's a way to get it done where the bodies are in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| not where the bodies are telling each other what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| And so I welcome the mayor stepping into the fray and helping out with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5558)|
| 1:32:47| Because I really don't think, you know, we want the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| The Board of Education wants the best for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| They want the best for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| This body wants the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| We don't want to be fighting and fussing and pointing fingers at each other all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| And so I welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| So could Dean or Mayor Burchett, could either one of you all talk about possibilities here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5586)|
| 1:33:15| as you all see them for another maybe a compromise or a resolution here into the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5595)|
| 1:33:24| where we don't just say, okay, we're going to vote up or down Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| Tim Burchett, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| I always say that and Vice Chairman Andrews gets kind of tickled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| I'm not really sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| I think that we need to make this a part of the, defer it, not to defer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5621)|
| 1:33:50| but to make it a part of the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| I want to make sure that the folks out in the Carter community have every opportunity to get this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5632)|
| 1:33:59| I think if we punt it, I think we might miss some opportunities that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5639)|
| 1:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| So in terms of the capital plan, if we don't take action right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| then we're looking at the capital plan for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| So the recommendation, are you all saying let's just hold tight with what we've got for one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| and address it in the coming capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| I think that would be appropriate, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| I think we've got to make sure that we give these folks out in Carter every opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| And so then my question then becomes for the financial gurus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| is this, and I'm sure Mr. Wright is involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| I don't know who else have been in that aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| then is this doable in the next capital year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| Does it look like with all these considerations financially that we have to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| is this doable to start putting into some firmness something that would lead us to a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5716)|
| 1:35:28| Thanks, John, for coming up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| The mayor has told me that he had wanted to take every single item that's on the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| and give it a second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| And so he wanted to have that opportunity before he started to make his priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| And so I think what he is at least discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| or considering is that give him a chance to look at all the different needs the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| and an opportunity to make a recommendation to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| without having a conclusion on what funds are available yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| because he hasn't had a chance to look at all the different needs yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| Okay, that's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| I'd like to make a substitute motion at this point and I'll get to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| The substitute motion is that it is the intent of the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| to provide funding for a new Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| To that end, this commission refers to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| and to the school's future capital plans for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| The wording can be, but basically the intent of this motion is to send it to the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| but also send the intent, that is the intent of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| to provide Carter Elementary, provide a new school for Carter Elementary in subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| It may not be the next capital year, it may be the next one, but as funding becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| So I'll make that in the form of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| So, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| Well, I will reserve the comments I had previous to ask this question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| If we do this, if this motion passes, then we are not going to reinstate that five million into their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5818)|
| 1:37:08| We're going to hold that still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| Question for, I guess, John Troy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5834)|
| 1:37:22| Dean Rodgerson indicated earlier that we're not, indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| that we're not looking to add to our debt service or bond indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5846)|
| 1:37:35| Let me ask, generally speaking, just real general broad strokes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| what percent of our budget comes from our property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| and what percent comes from the debt that we take on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| And that may be an unfair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| You're talking about in dollars or in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Percentage is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Or dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| The budget for debt service is about 66 million out of 647 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| So round number is 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| And the rest comes from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Monies that come in via sales tax or property tax, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Property tax, a round number is about $230 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| I guess what I'm saying, and I'm fine with the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Believe me, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| What I don't want this to be is an exercise that where we know the outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| but we're going to play this political thing on for a year, just to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| So if we're serious about trying to raise additional funds to build a new Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5908)|
| 1:38:35| one, I want to hear the Carter people saying that, hey, I understand that it's debt, it's property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| it's sales tax, that these are the things that runs the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| We can cut and be efficient as to a point, but there's some basic things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| And I want, you know, executive, school board, county commission, if we're serious about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5929)|
| 1:38:57| then we need to look at the whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| What is it going to take to make our schools great?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| What is it going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Are we wanting a good school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Are we wanting a great school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| What are we wanting out of this deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| I don't want to look at this, you know, and a year later we're having this same conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| and we're trying to delay it further or we're trying to move it to a back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| We've done a whole lot of talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| And, again, I'm fine with the substitute motion if we're serious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| You know, everyone wants to say no, no, no when we're talking about ways to generate income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| via industrial parts, via property tax, via whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| But at some point we're going to have to pay for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| As I've heard it said, balancing a checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| You cannot write a check for what you can, but you shouldn't write a check for more than you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| So if we know next year this time we're not going to be there and we have no intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=5999)|
| 1:40:07| zero intention of doing anything about our structure and our income stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| then what are we doing with this substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| I, for one, am ready to have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| But it has to be the whole conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| We have to talk about this in fullness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| So, you know, I'm excited about this, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| I think that it's time for us to have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| Am I talking about raising taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| What I'm talking about is looking at how we're run as a county, what do people want, what must we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6032)|
| 1:40:40| what are some of the things that are driving our costs up, not just, you know, certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| and let's talk about how we can make our schools great, how we can make our community great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| So I will be supporting this substitute motion, but I'll say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| if we're going to come right back here next year or at the end of budget time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| or whenever we have this conversation again with the same answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| being unwilling to look at certain aspects of our county portfolio, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6065)|
| 1:41:13| I just don't see where these monies are going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I really don't at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| And if someone can tell me, hey, I've got $10 million sitting over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| all we have to do is make these cuts, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| But if we're talking about people, then we're, you know, I'm not fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| So, again, let's be really serious about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| and let's not just throw out numbers and timelines to get a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| If we're going to do this thing, let's do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| Let's meet with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| Let's meet with the executive department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| Let's do what it takes, but let's not say we're going to try to defer it for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| in the hopes that something else will, you know, magically fall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| I had just one real quick comment is that we decided to pull the $5 million out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| Roughly $2 million of that, $2.1 million of that, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| was supposed to build the gym in the middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| that really has nothing at all to do with the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Do we want to take that out too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| I mean, we're taking that out if we do the $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| Do they still need the gym if we don't do the renovations at the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| and we're holding for a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| The short answer is the middle school still needs a middle school gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| What I'm saying is do we want to leave the money in for the middle school gym| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| so we're not putting that off a year or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| But where would it be located might be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| if there's no elementary school behind the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| I'm asking you this because I don't have an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| So you're suggesting just hold the whole part out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| It still all needs to be taken together in that where will the middle school gym be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6168)|
| 1:42:56| Right now it's to be slated for where the incoming transformers for the school site are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| Is there anything we need to leave in there that they're going to do out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| that needs to be taken care of immediately that they won't have funds for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| That's Dr. McIntyre maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6194)|
| 1:43:24| Thank you, Commissioner and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| I guess I would submit that there are a lot of things that we need to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| that not funding this $5 million will virtually guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| we'll not be in a position to address for at least another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| I think that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| We've had a lot of conversation about the Carter Elementary School facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| We've recommended a major renovation that will address some of those deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| I think deferring for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| certainly the Commission's prerogative to conduct this business as it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| but deferring that funding for at least a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| means that we won't be able to address some of those issues for at least a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| I think that's pretty unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| The need for a middle school gymnasium still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| I think the need for the site work and making the traffic flow better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| is very much tied up in the renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| because right now the front door to the school is on the front side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| although a lot of folks drop off at the side entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| that would become the main entrance under the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| But it probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense to do the site work piece in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| without doing the renovation at the Carter campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| And I think the other part of that is that there's some efficiencies to doing it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| So it's a difficult question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| I think the biggest challenge for me is if the funding is not included moving forward at your next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6288)|
| 1:44:56| or very soon, it does mean that we're not going to address some challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| with that school facility for quite some time, and I think that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| The other question, we've talked so much about the health of the children out there with the facility the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| If this thing gets put off for a year or two, are we going to be harming the children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| Mr. Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| I'll just say it pretty clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| I think that this is a mistake, the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| I think that we need to move forward with the renovations like the school board has asked us to do on more than one occasion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6334)|
| 1:45:41| We've talked about not wanting to hold the children hostage, but it looks like that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6341)|
| 1:45:48| And there are other schools that also have serious needs that need renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6348)|
| 1:45:59| and if we find extra money, it needs to go to the next school on the list that needs renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6359)|
| 1:46:09| We can't just look at Carter Elementary in isolation from the rest of the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| We need to look at the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| That's what the school board's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| That's how they've come up with this list of priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| and they have told us on more than one occasion and quite strongly that this is their priority list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| this is how they intend to move forward, and they have an excellent track record for doing these renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6391)|
| 1:46:41| And I'm going to support the school board on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| Commissioner Wright for some brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| This is most brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| The statement was we need a prioritized list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6413)|
| 1:47:01| That's exactly what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| The top of the list is Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| If the school board had brought anyone else to which I wanted to complain, I would have complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| I didn't complain about Jill Howie, someone in the middle, or the Southwest Sector School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| This is Carter Elementary, and I firmly believe, and everyone I talk to firmly believes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6437)|
| 1:47:25| that we're not doing the right thing for Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| It's Carter that's on the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| That was one school board member's opinion the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| They had three or four names that they wanted to see something done on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| Let's back up and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| What is the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| It's four schools, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| Carter is the only one we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| In all fairness to the person that wrote the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| they had every opportunity to send it back to us with detailed information stating they have the funds for a new Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6474)|
| 1:48:05| I did not read the next sentence, but I see it's kind of appropriate now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| If the commission wants to give additional funds, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| They have to prove to me how they will come up with the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| and not impact our capital budget, debt service, or general operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| So this unidentified Board of Education member is putting those words in print,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6506)|
| 1:48:37| and I have to take that person at their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| We need to do whatever it takes to make sure we have a full and complete dialogue with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| to see if we can work past this, and we do need to do it rather quickly, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6529)|
| 1:48:55| Not a year from now, but maybe not next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| The substitute motion is to say that the intent of the county commission is to provide the schools with funding for a new Carter Elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| This commission refers to the administration of the schools and the upcoming capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| to examine the options that are available for said funding and for said school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| That's basically the way it would be worded, but you understand the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| Now, today is not the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| This is just to send it on on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| If you would, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| We're really just voting to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| We're voting to send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| Do we want to send it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| Yes, this will be sent on, so this is not a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| Send it to Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| Send it to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| We have to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| We know we have to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| Let's just bring the vote up Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| But I guess you, is there a timeline involved in your, and I guess we'll flush that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| I don't know if we have something written down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| No, the timeline is in the upcoming budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| I mean, they're going to be doing budget discussions here in the next 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| and so my motion is for them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| and this is where we can have discussions with the school board if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| to sit down and talk about the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6614)|

| 1:50:26| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| Aye to send it on for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6627)|

| 1:50:49| Commissioner Schaus votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| The vote is ten to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| Substitute motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| It will move on to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| We've only got one item left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| But if you need to, we can take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| Item 27 is discussion regarding alcohol use in Knox County funded ten-year planned housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| Commissioner Ombi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| I put this on discussion because I brought it up last month in the workshop, which being, I guess, the new guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6681)|
| 1:51:28| and misunderstanding what I thought a workshop was, I tried to open it up for a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6688)|
| 1:51:35| and I apologize for stepping on anybody's toes if I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| This is something that is a concern of the citizens of the 4th District and a lot that I've talked to throughout the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6700)|
| 1:51:50| about alcohol being allowed in ten-year planned buildings like Mendenville, Flanagan, and any future that's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6710)|
| 1:52:02| And I asked the mayor to comment on it, and if he'd like to, I'd like him to come back down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| and state his stance on the alcohol being in the ten-year planned buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6728)|
| 1:52:16| Tim Burchett, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| I'll just restate what I stated before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| I appreciate you giving me this opportunity, Commissioner Ombi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| I think alcohol in these facilities is a deal-breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| I'm not sure what impact the $50,000 we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| and I think there's been some implication that Knox County doesn't do anything for its homeless citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| I think that is entirely in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| I think last year we put in over $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Where's John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| Troyer, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| You don't have to come up here and just nod. It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| It's over $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| So to think that some implication has been made that we're heartless and we don't care for these folks, I think that's totally in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| And I believe that's $6 million that I understand the vast majority of it we're not required to do a lot of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6781)|
| 1:53:10| but we do it because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| But, yeah, I still think alcohol in these facilities is the wrong way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| And if that's some sort of requirement from somewhere, then I would just suggest they do it on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6798)|
| 1:53:26| But I can't imagine that being a deal-breaker and the whole thing for the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| But if it is, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| I appreciate that, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| The reason I brought it up is because I have got tons of phone calls about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| tons of e-mails when I go to homeowner association meetings and talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| That is the thing that they bring up most is the 10-year plan and alcohol being allowed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| I'm not saying that they can't drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| I'm asking for the people that we're assisting that we're trying to help get off the streets and better their life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6837)|
| 1:54:05| that we do more than just give them housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| We need to have treatment for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| We need to find out what their issues are and address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| And just to say, well, one person, they're not an alcoholic, so they can have alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| If you're trying to treat an alcoholic that lives next door to one that drinks that's not an alcoholic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6863)|
| 1:54:30| he's never going to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| He's never going to improve his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| And I speak from experience of family members that are alcoholics and that have bettered their selves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| The thing is that we need to help these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| It's not about just giving them housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| It's about meeting them halfway and saying, okay, if you want help and you want off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6884)|
| 1:54:50| then let's help you quit your drinking or quit the use of drugs or whatever the case may be in your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6890)|
| 1:54:58| And that's the reason I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| It wasn't to step on anybody's toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| And the citizens state to me that if we're going to fund this as Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| and we're funding this, and, yes, it's only $50,000, we contribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| and I'm sitting here looking at the numbers of $5.934 million that we contribute to organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6915)|
| 1:55:23| that have plans in place for dealing with alcohol and homeless and drugs and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6923)|
| 1:55:33| We need to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| It's not homelessness is the issue, but there's a reason why they're homeless, and we need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| And I feel the same way, that if alcohol is going to be allowed in these residents, then that's a deal breaker to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6942)|
| 1:55:51| And I feel the citizens want us spending the money if we're not going to treat these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| and we're not going to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| So that's my stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| We have a citizen who has asked to speak on this, Mr. Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| If you'd like to come forward, give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| I'm here both for myself and also representing an organization that I'm the spokesperson for, TYP Choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6973)|
| 1:56:23| I think this is an interesting development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| First, it's interesting to me that no sitting current commissioner was involved in the passage of the original 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6991)|
| 1:56:39| back in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| And I think we need to put a little bit in perspective what happens around the country with these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| The concept of housing first, which the local 10-year plan is based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| in its purest form HUD refers to it as a low demand approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7013)|
| 1:57:00| That means little or no demands are placed on the formerly homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| that are placed in these housing projects around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| In its purest form, housing first literally means, in some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| as soon as a homeless person comes forward, decides to go into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7036)|
| 1:57:24| they are rapidly put into housing as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| In some areas the guidelines are within 30 days of making that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| Now in Knoxville they did do a little different plan through volunteer ministry center and the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7053)|
| 1:57:42| They altered that and actually provided between 60 and 90 days of transitional training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| which is one of the services that volunteer ministry center provides folks as they're trying to prepare for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7068)|
| 1:57:59| There are other plans across the country, 10-year plans or 10-year plan relatives as I would call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7079)|
| 1:58:07| that do have no alcohol policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7087)|
| 1:58:14| There are many homeless housing and recovery programs in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7094)|
| 1:58:21| and just to mention a few, Helen Ross McNabb, Knoxville Area Rescue Mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| Salvation Army and Steps House, there are, I believe, at least two dozen more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| that all provide services and recovery services for formerly homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| and every one to a T have an abstinence program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| In order to facilitate or participate in their programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| they have a zero tolerance abstinence program established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| Anyone, as Mr. Commissioner Owenby stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| anyone that has family experience with alcoholism knows that it was said recently at another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7139)|
| 1:59:07| that simply the smell of alcohol for a recovering alcoholic could be enough of a trigger to trigger them into a relapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7147)|
| 1:59:18| I think this is a first step in correcting what was done with very few people's true knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7158)|
| 1:59:28| when this plan was initially rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| Quite frankly, I don't believe this is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| I think the current 10-year plan has many more problems than just this abstinence issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| but I find that this is a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| I'd like to address two other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| To say that because this is a federally funded program or federal funds will be used to house these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| that TYP cannot mandate this in their housing is just quite simply incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| HUD itself issued about a year ago a memorandum to all of their permanent support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| excuse me, their public housing partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| and basically it was a request that they look to establish their own ban on smoking policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7214)|
| 2:00:22| at HUD funded facilities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| And, in fact, that memorandum actually went out to all HUD directors in all parts of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7225)|
| 2:00:33| to help establish HUD smoking bans at their facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| So to say that a federally funded program cannot legally ban alcohol or personal choice products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7239)|
| 2:00:49| just quite frankly, is not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| HUD itself has laid down that established policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| and it is there are many HUD programs across the country that ban smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7255)|
| 2:01:05| Well, I could keep talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| I've said enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| I appreciate the idea that this needs to go before commission and needs to be voted on, and I hope you do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| But first I have to say that I'm really kind of disappointed that I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7286)|
| 2:01:35| I'm wondering if this whole concept of housing first, if that's being completely understood as to how that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7295)|
| 2:01:47| that the idea is that, and this has proven to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| that if you are asking people to get clean and kick their addictions before you get them into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7314)|
| 2:02:04| there's very, very little success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| They tend to remain on the streets and the addictions are not dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| But if you give a chronically homeless person a home where they can be supervised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7331)|
| 2:02:20| where they can work with a caseworker who can help them with their treatment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| with their programs, and provide them a safe place off the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| then they do have a great deal of success with coping with their mental illness and with their addictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7351)|
| 2:02:39| So, and our 10-year plan is based on this housing first philosophy, which has been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7359)|
| 2:02:52| So I have great concerns about banning alcohol because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7372)|
| 2:03:02| and I'm not saying that I think they need to be sitting back, you know, popping a six-pack, you know, every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| But these are people with, who are going to be working on these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| who are going to be working on these addictions, who are going to be in treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| And they will be more successful if they are housed during that time than if we leave them out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| I also would like to also point out that KCDC currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7403)|
| 2:03:33| the housing vouchers in KCDC apartments, there is no restriction on alcohol in those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7413)|
| 2:03:45| And with the use of those vouchers, which is how most of these, this housing will be paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7425)|
| 2:03:53| I also wanted to know that if the county does drop its support for the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7433)|
| 2:04:01| are we just talking about the $50,000 that we put in as a line item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| Or are we talking about the five-year consolidated plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| What exactly are we talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| Because that's going to have a big impact on what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7459)|
| 2:04:27| So I would need some clarification on that as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| Has Dean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7473)|
| 2:04:47| Can you repeat the last part of your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| You're looking at what specifically the mayor is referring to as far as funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| You're talking about if the 10-year plan does not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| I'm assuming that what you all are asking is that the 10-year plan ban alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| from all of its permanent supportive housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| Is that what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| The mayor is simply stating that alcohol provided on premises would be a deal breaker for the counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7505)|
| 2:05:13| his support of county funding for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| That it is currently at $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| But if the program feels it is absolutely critical to allow these individuals that are in these developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7520)|
| 2:05:30| to drink while on site, that the county would no longer provide that funding to the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7530)|
| 2:05:38| That $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Are they talking about also the funding commitments that we've made in the five-year consolidated plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7540)|
| 2:05:49| If going forward there's a philosophical difference in the program, the direction the program is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| and the direction that the community feels that it should go in, or a majority thereof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| in a conversation with the mayor, then we'd have to evaluate all of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| Okay, so because that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| It would all be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| It would all be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| I am tremendously disappointed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| Again, there's over $6 million that the county provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Yes, I'm aware of how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| This is the number one issue in my district is chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| And I'm very disappointed that I don't think the administration has done all that they need to do to understand the situation yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7588)|
| 2:06:36| And I would hope that they would spend a little more time working on this with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| with the agencies that are providing these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| I know how much the county puts in because I hear that frequently from city people who work with the city administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7604)|
| 2:06:54| that the county's not doing its share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| The county has been doing its share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Absolutely it's been doing its share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| And that's one thing that I've tried very hard to get people to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| is that the county has put a great deal of money into supporting the chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| And it's money that when we are able to fully implement the 10-year plan and are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| as we have been up until this point, it's going to represent a tremendous savings for the county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7635)|
| 2:07:23| And I'm very much alarmed by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| And I hope that the administration will take a little more time and do a little more study on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7650)|
| 2:07:36| and spend some time with the people in my district talking about how this is affecting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7656)|
| 2:07:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| We've heard a lot about what HUD's rules are and so forth and so forth, that you're not allowed to have it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| But Jenny Weatherstone stood in front of a group in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| and said they allowed it in the rooms, they just could not take alcohol in the hall, but they would allow it in the rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| So where do we have the truth in all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| We've got John Lawyers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| John, would you mind coming and talking about this a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| For those of us that are, you know, we're all affected either directly or indirectly by drug use and alcohol abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7709)|
| 2:08:39| And so certainly this is an alarming type of situation to those of us that are, you know, we're compassionate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7719)|
| 2:08:48| We want people to get well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| We want them to avoid their addictions and get well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7730)|
| 2:08:56| But certainly it is a troubling thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| And I don't, it's another one of these topics that, you know, when you're in our seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| we can't know the details of all the things that are taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| And certainly I don't know the details that involve treatment and stabilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| that has to take place before you place people in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| I remember you talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| I remember you talking about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| And so I guess that's what I'm looking for is an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| How does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| How is it possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| Why is it good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| John Lawler, Director of the Tenure Plan to End Chronic Homelessness, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| Several good questions there, and I'd like to address all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| And if I skip one, you can come back and ask me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| But I think how you begin when you think about the Tenure Plan to End Chronic Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| the goal for every individual that is chronically homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| remember these are disabled individuals who have been homeless for more than a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| or had four bouts of homelessness over a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| The disabling condition falls into one of three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| It's mental health-related, mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| It's addiction-related, alcohol or drug addictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| Or it's physical disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| Or it could be a combination of any three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| So these folks are trapped on the street because of their disabling condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| As Mr. Peabody pointed to earlier, the individuals who put together the Tenure Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| and let me correct him on one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| there was a lot of community input on putting together the Tenure Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| And something that the Tenure Plan had that I think is important for you to consider hearing from is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| they had subject matter experts that came together, the Roger Noe's of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| the Dr. David Patterson's, that knew about the different approaches to ending chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| And we as a community landed on Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| Now Housing First in its purest form, as Mr. Peabody spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| is something we've not been able to use simply because we don't have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| affordable housing available, readily available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| that the partners have control of to where we can move someone rapidly into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| Every person that's chronically homeless that starts moving towards housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| starts that movement because they say to a case manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| I'm willing to deal with the core issue that is the source of my homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| We all realize, the case management community, the service provider community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| realizes the only way you can successfully deal with that core issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| is remove someone from the chaos of the street as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| That's why Housing First does not demand a sobriety requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| It requires you to say I'm committing to a case management relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| I'm committed to a life of accountability and a life of personal responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| And in light of that life, the sooner we can get me into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| away from the chaos and unpredictability of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| the more likely I am to succeed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| Since July 1st of 2008, the homeless service provider community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7932)|
| 2:12:19| has placed over 350 chronically homeless individuals in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| Eighty-five percent of those still remain in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| This is a concept that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| To think because we say we're going to ban alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| I think we're missing the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| We've got a concept that is working right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| in this proving successful for folks that are trapped on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| because of their disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| I think you also have to remember, as you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| 16% of the chronically homeless population report that the reason for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| being disabled is alcohol-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| 84% fall into the other categories of the other disabling characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| So you're talking about 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| So to think that we're housing folks without accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| or personal responsibility is completely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| Every person that has gone into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| and all the housing up to this point primarily has been in KCDC housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| It's only today that the first residents began entering into Menville Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| And then a year from now, hopefully they'll be entering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| into Flinagan Development, South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| But it's personal responsibility, personal accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| helping you through an individual case plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| deal with a core issue that led to your homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| that set you up for not just housing success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| but the ability to successfully reintegrate into the community in which you live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| to reclaim your life and have a whole and complete life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| because you've dealt with that core issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| But we just believe that Housing First allows us to more effectively do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| than any other strategy that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| There may be another question here that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| and I know some of the other folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| As regards your, you feel like you're successful with 85% of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| that you've placed thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Of those individuals, I guess related just to the alcohol issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8060)|
| 2:14:29| for those individuals, 16% of those that had alcohol problems of the 85% or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8069)|
| 2:14:37| do you see, I mean, are you all able to produce some data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| or some evidence of success along those lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8082)|
| 2:14:47| for those individuals that have alcohol-related issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| Well, I've heard Dr. David Patterson from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| who's with us in the School of Sociology, say that the data is very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| that people's consumption of alcohol decreases when you move them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| from the street into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Because remember, when you leave the chaos of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| you're beginning to deal with that core issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| Success isn't just allowing you to deal with the core issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| so you can succeed at housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| You deal with that so you can reclaim your life and have a full and complete life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| within the context of the community you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| We currently are in a process with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| and the Health Department conducting a study to look at folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| that what did they cost the community before they were housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| versus after they've been housing for a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| And what that will show you is, I'm going to guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| a lot of folks who had a lot of public intoxication, arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| while they were outside of housing, it will be interesting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| what happens to them once they get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| But what the nationwide studies show, when you look at city by city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| it reduces drastically because, again, you've got the stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| of a community around you and safe and secure housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| Okay. I guess I have this overwhelming amount of respect for Roger Noe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8167)|
| 2:16:13| And what I've read about him and my discussions with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| I mean, he's obviously just an outstanding individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| and an authority, an absolute authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| And for you to have him in your court says a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8186)|
| 2:16:32| Now, but to this issue of alcohol and abstention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| if somebody goes into a facility and we know that alcohol is their core issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| then how successful are you with these people that you've placed thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8203)|
| 2:16:49| and their core issue of alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| Honestly, it would only be anecdotal if I were to report anything right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| because, again, as you remember, I'm not on the front line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| I'm case managing the individuals who are going into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| So that would be a great question to park and me get good information for you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| But it would only be anecdotal if I start speaking to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| Mr. Rice, if you would come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| I believe you wanted to make a clarification on a statement from earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| I want to speak to you, Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| In terms of the, I said it's all on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| I misunderstood what you were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| I'm not referring to the over $6 million that the county provides in multiple areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| I'm referring only to that portion of funding that is appropriated to the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| and any subsequent funding that would be related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| So only to funding that is designated in the budget as in the line item 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| You're not talking about the five-year consolidated plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| In terms of going forward with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| there's potential for growth of funding requests on that in terms of caseworker funding and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| That is a budget line that could likely grow as these two facilities roll out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| That would be part of the funds that would be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| but only as it's in relation to the 10-year plan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| So not the five-year consolidated plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| Not the PG dollars, not the home or HUD grant monies, not the indigent care funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8304)|
| 2:18:30| not the individual grants that are going to multiple agencies that are doing tremendous work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8310)|
| 2:18:37| And this really is simply looking at the policy of allowing alcohol on the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8317)|
| 2:18:43| not requiring somebody to be completely independent from their substance abuse issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8323)|
| 2:18:50| or have worked through everything in their life to come to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| to allow alcohol on the premises if there's taxpayer dollars going to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| Thank you for that clarification, but I will reiterate that I am a little disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8339)|
| 2:19:04| and I do expect and hope that you and the administration will spend some time in the second district with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8344)|
| 2:19:12| I would like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| I know the mayor would as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| Mr. Lawler, I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| First, if you're for allowing them to drink until they wing themselves off of it, per se, what is a good time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8366)|
| 2:19:39| I know you're not a case manager, but I mean, how many chances are we going to give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8379)|
| 2:19:46| Is it going to be six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| Is it going to be seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Is it going to be eight, ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| I mean, how long are we going to allow this to go on before we finally say, okay, enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| You're not meeting your end of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| I think traditionally how that's handled currently in housing is when whatever core issue is causing a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8398)|
| 2:20:06| to be a burden or bothersome to the community in which they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8406)|
| 2:20:13| that's at the point you start addressing the behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| And if it continues on to the point where they are disruptive and disrupting that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| then I think you have to talk to them about placing them somewhere else that may be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8421)|
| 2:20:28| But it's usually when any behavior is illegal, okay, that's the reason for eviction, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8428)|
| 2:20:36| or is disruptive on a continual basis to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| then what I see is that property managers begin to deal with case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| and figure out a new placement for that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| Yeah, because I mean, I know it's hard to wean off from seeing relatives go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| and I know it's not an easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| The thing is, is all we're saying, it's like at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| I don't drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| I don't allow drinking at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| My relatives know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| If you're going to come over, you live by my rules if you're going to come to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8462)|
| 2:21:08| The thing is, is that I'm not saying that they can't drink and wean themselves off this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| I'm just saying that most taxpayers and most citizens that I've talked to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| if we're going to allow them to drink on premises, that's defeating the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| They're never going to wean off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| And that's the reason I say no drinking on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| They can go to a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| They can go to a friend's house, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| But the thing is, is that we've got to start somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| and there's got to be a middle ground that we can meet where we say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| we're going to meet you halfway and say, okay, if you drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| we're not telling you to go completely off of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| but you're not going to drink in this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| and we're not going to allow anybody else to have that around them to entice them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| Can I respond by raising the discussion up to about 5,000 feet but instead of ground level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| Our office recognizes with the city administration that, boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| it would be silly to drive a stake in the ground about this issue and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| by gosh, if the 10-year plan philosophically can't have this operative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| and they're different in the developments that they're partnering with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| then we just won't take our toys and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| The city administration has been dialoguing with Dean Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| I mean Dean Rice and Mayor Burchett, about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| and talking about what does a compromise look like because we all realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| in order for the 10-year plan to be successful long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| it really needs the county and the city behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| To end chronic homelessness, which is a huge undertaking to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| both bodies are going to have to be firmly behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| So it may be helpful to just talk to Dean Rice about anything he's privy to share about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8567)|
| 2:22:53| to what degree they have talked about what compromise would look like here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8573)|
| 2:22:57| because, again, no one's driving a stake in the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| and saying we've got to have it one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| Maybe there's a middle ground that's a win-win for both groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| And that's what I'm really looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| I'm looking for a compromise here, something that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| But right now there's nothing that I see that's written down that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8591)|
| 2:23:16| okay, if you get caught drinking the first time, it's a slap on the wrist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| If you get caught the second time, you're out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| We need a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| There needs to be something written in this 10-year plan that gives guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8605)|
| 2:23:29| and can give reassurance to the citizens that there's going to be help for these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| and that we're not just wasting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| That's an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| I think that's what I'm trying to say is I don't want to have a conversation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| when I know that there's a bigger policy discussion going on about is there a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| Because the compromise would be made because even if the city affirms a housing-first approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| they still want the county at the table being in support of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| So what might that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| So I know those discussions are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| And so I don't want to sit here and tell you that we're real firm in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| I think it's going to be up to the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| and the county administration coming up with that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| and then this legislative body determining if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| And I understand that, and I see that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| Another question I have, it was stated that if they had a record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| they would not be admitted into housing-first in the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| But yet the first resident that moved into Mimminville stated that he has a criminal record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8670)|
| 2:24:36| Moved in where? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| The first one that was admitted into Mimminville is in the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| Mimvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Mimvilla. Sorry. Sorry. Apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| He stated he had a criminal record, but yet it was stated that they would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| nobody with a criminal record would be entered into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what was stated and who it was stated by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| I know that everyone that's going into Mimvilla first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| is coming from the Jackson Avenue apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| and those folks went through a screening process to get to Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| and they've proven to live successfully there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| So the particulars about that person's history I'm not sure on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8713)|
| 2:25:18| and what statement was made, I'm also not clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| I think the thing that concerns me is I'm new on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| and I wasn't here when all this was approved five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| I don't know how many others were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| The thing that concerns me is that, yes, it's been stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8730)|
| 2:25:33| that the community was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| From my understanding and from going to all the community forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| that's been on the 10-year plan in the last year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8739)|
| 2:25:44| the only ones that I've seen that communities were involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| were around the 4th and Gill and the North Nossua area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| And there was nobody from my standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| and I sit on West Hills Homeowner's Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| we were never entered into this fray, we were never questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| Other communities, Rocky Hill, Dean Hill, other ones in my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8761)|
| 2:26:05| nowhere else out east was in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| And that's the thing that concerns me is that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| you can say that we've got community involvement and support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8770)|
| 2:26:14| but you're talking a small group of community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| You're not talking the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| And I think that those citizens that are paying the bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| have a right to have their voice heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| and be let known what's going on with the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| and have some input on how it's operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| Well, yeah, and we've heard that loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| In fact, one of the public meetings we've been having on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| you've attended several of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| The one that was at the Dean Hill Community Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| dealt specifically with the creation of the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| and to what extent neighborhoods were involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| and how were they invited to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| So I think it was more than just kind of the 4th and Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| and surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| But, again, folks from your own community development department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| Linda Russ could tell you specifically who was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| five or six years ago when it was put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| And what we've tried to do is, against that criticism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| involve the entire community in the discussion about the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| as we've been having these community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8831)|
| 2:27:18| Commissioner Burroughs, did you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| I just wanted to make clear, in terms of the cost of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8842)|
| 2:27:28| and the taxpayers who are paying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| the people who live within the city limits, they pay city taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| They also pay county taxes at the same rate as everybody else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8855)|
| 2:27:40| So we are putting our city tax money into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| We're putting our county tax money into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8863)|
| 2:27:46| So the people who are paying for it, and we're also paying for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8866)|
| 2:27:50| and it's not just the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| It's my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| It's the eight other neighborhoods that are around the urban core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| and probably at least a dozen more beyond that circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| that are paying for this, not only in terms of tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| but in terms of the economic problems this causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8888)|
| 2:28:17| property values, new businesses starting up, all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| We have borne the cost of this for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| and as county and city residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| we're paying taxes to both entities who are paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8912)|
| 2:28:37| And I think it would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| I know that Linda has gone over this before more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| about how neighborhoods were involved in the earliest discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| and I do think that the 10-year plan has made great progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8932)|
| 2:28:57| in being more inclusive as they move forward, and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| and I thank you for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| and I hope that we can continue to have constructive conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8943)|
| 2:29:08| as we move forward, but I want to make sure everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| that city residents pay county taxes, too, at the same rate as everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| So we're paying for this on more than one front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8957)|
| 2:29:23| Did you wish to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| Just a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| From the Dean Hill meeting that Mr. Lawler referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| what came out and was confirmed at that meeting was that of the initial four working groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| that created the 10-year plan back in 2004 and 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| there were approximately 12 individuals that came from neighborhoods in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8984)|
| 2:29:51| and of those 12, they were from either 4th and Gill, Old North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| North Knoxville, or COIN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| COIN representing the inner city neighborhoods, as well as Island Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| and I believe a few others on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| So to say that it's inclusive or that they attempted to make it inclusive at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| I just believe is not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| That's why the majority of Knoxvillians until probably the last six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| if you had asked 100 people in the county what the 10-year plan was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| I'd be shocked if more than eight of them would have been able to even tell you what they thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| and probably less than two of them would have actually known what the plan was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| Very little knowledge of this plan existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| specifically until the last year in the county and in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| I'd like to make one other point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Success by the measure of the current 10-year plan is measured by remaining in housing for 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9044)|
| 2:30:51| It is not based on alcohol or drug addiction recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| It is not measured by job retraining and placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| The single factor, one, that the current 10-year plan uses to measure its success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9060)|
| 2:31:07| is based on remaining in housing after 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| Now that's curious to me and curious to many people that actually understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9071)|
| 2:31:16| because according to the first HUD report that was ever done on housing first concept nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9076)|
| 2:31:23| which was issued in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| it actually says that after a three-year period in housing first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| housing first concept has no better success rate of remaining in housing than the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9091)|
| 2:31:38| or normal continuum of care process which has existed in this country for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| as long as there have been housing or homeless service providers providing recovery services for homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9103)|
| 2:31:53| I think the idea that success rate is based only on housing after 12 months is not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9113)|
| 2:32:01| And as far as the success nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| some estimates say that HUD and the federal government since 2000 have spent close to $200 billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9124)|
| 2:32:12| $200 billion on housing and chronically homeless housing projects across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9132)|
| 2:32:20| Today we see less than, from 2000 to 2010, less than a 6% national decrease in overall homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9140)|
| 2:32:30| I don't know how successful that actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| One of the plans that is typically cited when you talk to many of the 10-year plan officials here in Knoxville is Seattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9154)|
| 2:32:46| Well, the fact of the matter is in Seattle, beginning in 2000 to current days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| they built almost 12,000 both low income and chronic and homeless housing units in both the city of Seattle and in King County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9171)|
| 2:33:01| Today they have, by the last count that was just done in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| almost 10,000 homeless people in the city of Seattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| and countywide they say they have almost 27,000 in King County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9192)|
| 2:33:18| Now, Seattle is regularly used as a success for Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9198)|
| 2:33:24| They have thousands of units of permanent supportive housing, thousands of units of Housing First housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| I don't know who in the world believes that that is referred to as a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| They have almost twice as many homeless in Seattle and King County today than they did 10 years ago when that plan started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9216)|
| 2:33:43| Mr. Peabody, I hate to stop you, but we're talking about, we're getting in now to a whole other realm of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| Those comments were brought up and I wanted to address them, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| Mr. Owenby, we've really gone on this, but I want to be respectful and let you comment on what you want to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9232)|
| 2:34:03| The only other, oh, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| Well, it's not related to this, but it's a general comment whenever it's appropriate, or a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| No, the only thing we have now is audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| Our audit committee members wanted to brief us on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| That's all we have left, so you can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| Well, you know, and we kind of hold the citizens to a pretty strict adherence to time rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9256)|
| 2:34:24| I think today, and I don't know how we want to mold today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| Today may not have speaking limitations, but I do remember some time limits on the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9268)|
| 2:34:38| and the number of times that commissioners could speak to an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| So I just want to get a little clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| And if we don't want to adhere to that in the work session, that's fine with me, but I think we need to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9285)|
| 2:34:56| I think my feeling is on the work session that this is the opportunity for people to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| and I don't want to come in and say, well, you can only speak twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| because something may come up that you really feel the need to speak to again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| So to me, the work session is just one of these opportunities for people to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| and to get any thought process that they have out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9312)|
| 2:35:16| Now, in the regular meeting, if you want to establish guidelines, I will adhere to those guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| but I want to be respectful to my fellow commissioners that if you do have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| if something comes up, that you have the opportunity to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| Also, members of the community, we want to give them the opportunity to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| but I think that one of the things I'm going to start doing is kind of narrowing that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9332)|
| 2:35:37| rather than having discussion over on issues that's not before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| I'd like to kind of narrow that if I can, you know, in subsequent meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| And I only say that because I was hesitant to come back again and speak to an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| I just didn't know what our marching orders were going to be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| I think in the work session, everybody has an opportunity to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| and get their comments out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| Yes, Ms. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| Were you all going to have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| We don't have public forum at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| That's a designated time, but if you'd like to speak, we'll be happy to hear you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| I just wanted to make a couple of comments with regard to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| So if you have some time available after your audit committee discussion, it will only take a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| Is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9383)|
| 2:36:24| Let's do the audit and then we'll be happy to hear you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9384)|
| 2:36:27| So, Commissioner Shouse, Commissioner Wright, anything you'd like to brief us on on audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| We had a relatively brief meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| I guess the two things, the two most important things to me, the solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9396)|
| 2:36:44| Richard, the solid waste audit is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| Probably he didn't give us an exact number, but halfway through more or less, Richard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| It sounds about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| I told him, I was reminded, and I reminded him of the Pam Reeves report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| which was on our agenda for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| I guess it's on for Monday, next week's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| And also the much talked about hotline has been delayed briefly because of a personnel issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9428)|
| 2:37:18| It's actually Ms. Dupes was handling some paperwork on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| Of course, she's no longer with the county, so that's slowed down a little bit, but we hope not over a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| So the hotline where people can report waste, abuse, fraud, et cetera, that issue is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9447)|
| 2:37:37| We didn't have any really hot topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| About half the meeting was devoted to audit of the school's special funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9458)|
| 2:37:43| which really is quite a bit of money, nearly $7 million passes through the school's special activity funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9463)|
| 2:37:50| That's coupon books and ticket sales and high school games and PTA, this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9470)|
| 2:37:56| and just a lot of things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| About half our meeting was devoted to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| And we will meet again on January the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| If Mr. Wright wants to embellish any other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9484)|
| 2:38:10| The thing that I was going to make comment to, the next meeting is January the 18th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9490)|
| 2:38:17| It's the same day as the work session for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| So if you're interested in the audit committee, it's like a twofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9500)|
| 2:38:29| Mr. Jett, have we set a date for the workshop on zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-nov-0810-preview?start=9509)|
