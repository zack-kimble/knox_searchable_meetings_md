| 0:11:17| John Curry with Regal Cinemas, 510 South Gay Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| We've got a development or something really that's, I would say, that would be of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I mean, you see that there's a problem there with the footage, but it has come to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=693)|
| 0:11:43| that there was an ordinance passed back in 2008 that actually did away with, excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| me, 98, excuse me, 98, that actually did away with sight distance within certain boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| And that would include Gay Street, Market Square Mall, the Old City, I don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=718)|
| 0:12:07| Depot, do you have the exact parameter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Okay, we've got a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| I know you can all see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| I'd be glad to pass it around, but essentially it's Gay Street and the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| I've got it upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| It looks better now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| This is the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| This is Gay Street right down here, Market Square over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| That's the shaded section in green, the section that is exempted from the on-premises permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| requirement, the 300-foot distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| For schools and churches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| And does it have any minimum distance or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| Just totally exempted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Because it's a downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Provisions of Subsection A shall not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Could you please speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| The provisions of Subsection A of this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Subsection A says no retailer's permit shall be issued for consumption of beer on the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| where the premises are within 300 feet of any school building, any hospital, any church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| building, or any funeral home as measured from building line to building line by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| shortest distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Then you come down to Subsection D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Subsection D says the provisions of Subsection A shall not apply to any establishment or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| premises which receives and holds a state license for the sale of liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| And, in addition, the provisions of Subsection A shall not be applicable in the territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| of the city within the boundaries described in this subsection, these boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| And essentially that's recognizing, I guess, that it's a center city with a lot of dense development probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=821)|
| 0:13:50| I have a vague recollection of when this was done in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| And I recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| You're a young man, though, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I was much younger then than I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| But my recollection on it is at the time the issue was establishments located in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| But as it was proposed, it included the old city and essentially downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=848)|
| 0:14:18| Is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| We had this debate once before, but we didn't realize there was an exemption for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| I would agree with that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| So with that being said, the question is, I mean, there was a site problem with your location potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| and that's why we went through this exercise, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| So back to regular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| That's the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Seeing no lights, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=898)|

| 0:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Ms. Martin, if you don't mind, if you would make sure that all the members of council have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Yeah, I was just curious, how is the Westtown Theater doing as far as serving beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| It's actually proven to be very well for the theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| It's certainly a great incremental item for that particular crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Could I ask as long as he's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Are you serving it like in bottles or just cup containers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| What are you doing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| We actually pour them from bottled containers, so single serve item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| into a plastic cup that can be easily seen in the auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| We also wristband everyone who's purchasing that's of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| So they don't pass it around, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Correct, so that we can watch that inside the theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Plus we have a two drink maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| Who monitors it inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Our internal staff, management, ushers, concession attendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| I wondered, how did that come to our attention, that development, the 1998 ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| How did we find that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| How did that come to our attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Ms. Martin called it to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| I don't know how it came to her attention, to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| We had mistakenly thought that that had been repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| And for what reason, I'm not sure right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| And then we had looked at it and it had not been repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| So for any confusion that may have ensued, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| My confusion was I had seen it there on a number of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| But my recollection of that was that the described area was an area limited to the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1016)|
| 0:17:04| Frankly, I had not remembered that it included a much wider section of the city than the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| And so my memory failed me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| That's the first thing to go is everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Saveway number 10 is asked to be withdrawn from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| And that will take a motion from the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| All those in favor of the withdrawal, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1054)|

| 0:21:49| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| And there's no building for the measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Why don't we go ahead and address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Yeah, we're at the corner of north of Mabry Hood and Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Of course, we have a contract to buy the property subject to getting a billing permit and beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| There's no church or school within 50 foot of our property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| Mr. Swanson, let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Of course, it would be through, yeah, 50 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Mr. Swanson, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| It's subject to approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| I mean, would it be, could that be a circumstance here to where we could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| That's entirely up to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| If you want to approve it subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| that final documentation certainly would include the creation of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| and the measurements required for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Well, I was going to ask the same question in terms of if we do it subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| does that then prevent them from being able to purchase the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| In other words, do they have to have a building on the grounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| In order to purchase the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Well, I think it was, that's what you're, is that not what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Yeah, what we do is we can't, we don't build a store without a billing permit and a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| We don't buy the land until we're approved for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| And it is subject to approval of meeting all requirements after the store is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Again, that's entirely up to the beer board if you want to do it that way or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Just because they do it that way doesn't mean you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| I know, but how have you done it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| It doesn't mean you don't have to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| How have you done it in the past for us newbies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Well, I mean, that's, I don't recall, you know, in the last year that we've had a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| But, again, it's, you know, it's really they're at risk because of, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| I would feel pretty confident as many Weigel stores as there are that they're going to meet the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1437)|
| 0:24:05| you know, the site distance anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| And if they didn't, then it would be, you know, it would be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| It never was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| It never was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| I mean, it's, I don't have a problem moving forward with it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| As long as it's, you know, subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| I'll move we recommend pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110628?start=1462)|
