| 0:07:40| You'll state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| Kevin Tilbury, Kimley Horn & Associates, Tenley Avenue, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Well, thank you for the opportunity to come and address you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| If you'll recall, I came before you, I believe it was about two months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| and I sort of told you about the things that we were going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| and I'm pleased to share with you tonight that we've done a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| So today I'm going to give you a briefing on what we've been up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| over the last couple of months, have some interesting information to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| We've had a lot of conversations with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| So we'll share that information with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| and then we'll let you know where we're going from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| and I'll be happy to entertain any questions that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| So just as a quick refresher about what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| Advance Knox is a comprehensive plan for transportation and land use for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| And so this is going to be sort of the guiding document or the blueprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| that's going to help you all make decisions over the next several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| It's one of the most important, or if not the most important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| planning effort that your staff has ever undertaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| And so this has been their top priority for the last several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| and they put a lot of time and effort into having public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| and doing the analysis in partnership with the consultant team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| So this is a really important document and really important process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| So speaking of process, if you could go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| This is where we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| So we're still at the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| We've organized Advance Knox around three major outreach efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| and you can see that they're listed there, rounds one, two, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| And so we are in the process of wrapping up round one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| where we're doing more listening to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| And so I'll share a little bit of that with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| But that's not the only thing that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| We also did some analysis on where the county stands today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| and that's called the state of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| And so that's one of the things that I wanted to share with you first is what we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| So we spent the last several months analyzing the existing lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| If you want to go to the next slide, and we'll talk a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| So before we can start looking at our future, we need to understand where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| And so we looked at the state of the county in terms of four major areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| in terms of the people, the places, prosperity, and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| And we thought that was a good way to kind of size up what we think some of the issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| as a way of communicating to the public as we move forward with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| and as we can update this document every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| So I'm going to share with you a few of the highlights just to whet your appetite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| By no means am I going to be able to convey everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| We're in the process of wrapping up the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| and I would encourage every one of you to go in and read the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| so you can get the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| If you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| So let's start with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| So this looks at demographics, household characteristics, education, all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| And so a couple of things that stood out to us when we were looking at the data is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| one is that the average household size continues to steadily decline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| and it's been that way since the 1990s, so over the last several decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| and it's lower than the national average, so about 2.37 people per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| And that's a result of a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| It's our aging population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| So as people downsize and they no longer have families, it gets smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| So it's a number of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| So that's one of the things that stood out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| And then I don't think this would come as a surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| but Knox County is also on average more highly educated than the nation as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| So about four out of ten residents, 25 and over, have a bachelor's degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| which, of course, is due in large part to being home to the University of Tennessee here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| So those are a couple of things that stood out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| If you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| The other thing that we found interesting, too, this slide talks about cost of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| and it's reflected as a ratio to the overall national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| So you see Knox County is right at about 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| So that means if something costs on average across the nation a dollar, you're paying about 89 cents here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| So generally speaking, the cost of living here is lower than the national average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| and it's also generally on par with the surrounding counties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| So we're keeping it affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| The contrast to that is our median income is significantly higher than the national average, or rather state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| So the median income is about household income is just over $73,000 per year compared to the state median income of about $55,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=750)|
| 0:12:40| So significantly higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Those are a couple of things that stood out to us about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Let's turn the page and talk about place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| So this place talks about how we treat our land, so land use, how we develop the land, what's been preserved, all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=768)|
| 0:12:59| Yep, there we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| So what you see there, the green on the map represents the amount of undeveloped land in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| And so while we've certainly seen a lot of growth happen over the last few decades in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| there's still a good bit of undeveloped land as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| About 52% of the land is undeveloped still, and that's about 134,000 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| which you see represented in green there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| And the chart that you see is how that breaks down in terms of parcel size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| So the vast majority of that undeveloped land are in smaller parcels, less than 10 acres, about 80% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| And then it goes up from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| The average vacant parcel size is just under 24 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| That will give you a sense of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| And so one of the things that we'll think about as part of the comprehensive plan is how we want to treat that land in green moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| So that's one of the questions that we're going to ask as part of the planning process, and we'll talk more about that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| And I don't think this will come as a surprise to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| This chart shows the year-over-year number of new housing starts in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| And as you can see, year-over-year, it increased every year since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| We're not quite at pre-recession levels, but we're definitely getting there, and you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| It's actually, you know, that rate of increase has accelerated in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| So we know that housing is definitely a hot property in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| So, you know, let's talk a little bit about prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| This chart is the gross domestic product, which is sort of a dry graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| It's a measure of overall economic output in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| The chart itself is not necessarily, or the data is not as interesting as the fact, is if you look at the individual lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=900)|
| 0:15:08| you see that the county, the metropolitan statistical area, and the state are all represented there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| And there's a dip that you can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| That's obviously COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| But what's interesting is that the county, you'll notice, is tracking a little bit better than the state and the MSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| And so what that tells us is that Knox County on whole has been more resilient than the rest of the state in terms of recovering from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| So we thought that was really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Now, the flip side of that is affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| So we know that Knox County is a prosperous place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Our income is higher than average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| But we also want to make sure that it stays affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| I'm sure you've all seen the news about inflation, concerns about inflationary pressures nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| And so that's something that we're concerned about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| The map that you see here are called cost burdened households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| And those are households that spend more than 30% of their income on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| The darker green are the areas that spend progressively higher percentages of their income on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| So that's something that we want to pay attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| The Knoxville Association of Realtors released a report that said in 2022 the home prices right now are about 2.2 times the average wage of the average resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=979)|
| 0:16:31| So that's something that we want to continue to pay attention to in terms of affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| That we want to make sure that when we make decisions about transportation and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| And by the way, we also looked at how much each household spends on transportation in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| And they spend about 30% of their income on transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| So if you take household and transportation costs combined, it's just under 60% of household incomes are being spent on those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| So that's one of the things that we want to pay attention to as we make decisions about transportation and land use in our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| Is making sure that we're resulting in places that are affordable to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| So hand in hand in that is infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| So let's talk just a minute about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| We've got about 62 miles of greenways and 140 miles of sidewalk in the unincorporated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| One of the things that we heard in public outreach is that people want to see more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| So we'll talk more about that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| But we also looked at roads and bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| And so right now there are about 1,700 miles of roadways and 130 bridges in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| Jim Stoden can take a bow and pat himself on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| We also looked at the quality of those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| And 88% of the roads are classified as being in good or fair condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| So that's great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| And 100% of the bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| So we are doing as a county, we are doing a great job of keeping our infrastructure in a good state of repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| But one of the things that a trend that we stood out to us that we want to pay attention to is how much liability we're taking on into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1083)|
| 0:18:14| So in 1993, about 29% of all roads in the county were subdivision roads that are maintained by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| Fast forward to 2020, that number is 44%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| So a higher proportion of that infrastructure is now going to have to be maintained by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| So from 1993 to 2020, we added 370 lane miles of subdivision roads that the county had to maintain compared to about 15 lane miles of arterials and collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1114)|
| 0:18:48| So we thought that was a really interesting statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| So as we continue to build places in the future, we need to think carefully about the maintenance liability that we're also incurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| If you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Another way of looking at infrastructure is not just the actual facilities, but how people use those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| So this map shows the average commute time to work in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| So this is the percent of commuters that I think are more than 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| And you can see the further out you get into the county, the darker that becomes, meaning those people have to travel further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| But the average time is just over 22 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| And if you compare that to the national average, which is 28 minutes, we're still doing a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| So our commute time on average is still less than the national average, which is a quality of life issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| And so one of the things that we want to pay attention to in the future is to make sure that we continue to maintain that lower than average commute time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1181)|
| 0:19:52| So that was just a sampling of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| There was a lot of interesting stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| So I would encourage you all, when it's ready, to read the State of the County Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| And it will be ready I think later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| So I would encourage you to dive into that a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| But now I want to shift gears just real briefly and talk about what we heard for public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| That was the other big thing that we've been up to over the last couple of months, if you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| And so we called it Ideas Week, and it was more than just a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| It encapsulated a lot of different activities that we got into, if you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| And as I mentioned before, it was one of three rounds of outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| So this one dealt with ideas, and then the next one will deal with choices, and then finally priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| But this one was all about listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| So we didn't really have much to show people or to tell people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| It was about us listening to stakeholders and to the public to get feedback from them that we could then use as a strong foundation for the planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1240)|
| 0:20:49| So if you go to the next slide, we'll talk a little bit more about what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| So we started in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| As I mentioned, I was here before you to give you a briefing, to give you an overview of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| We also went to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| We went to the planning commission, the town of Farragut, and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| So we briefed all of those entities to bring them up to speed on the process so they're all aware of what we're doing and what we've been up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| So that was one of the first things that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| If you go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| We also communicated with stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| So we mentioned the schools, the development community, health and social services, all the different types of stakeholders in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| We had conversations with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| We've also convened two committees that we will continue to engage throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| As a matter of fact, we're having meetings with them tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| And that is an advisory committee made up of citizens, professional associations, developers, realtors, community and civic organizations, all the different entities that should have a voice in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1302)|
| 0:21:55| And then also a technical committee that's made up of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| And so those two bodies we briefed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| We had meetings with them, and we'll actually have more meetings with them tomorrow as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| And then finally, we had engaged members of the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| If you want to go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| So this is where the concept of ideas week came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| The last week in March, we went out to I believe it was about eight different locations across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| And the locations that we chose were specifically because they were accessible and highly recognizable in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| And for the most part, it was high schools, in a few cases, middle schools and elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| And so one of the things that we're doing as part of the process is learning what worked and what didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| And so when we go back out and do outreach in the future, we can fine tune that approach and make sure that we're at the best locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1362)|
| 0:22:50| Most of those meetings were in the late afternoon slash early evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| But we also provided other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| So we did a virtual town hall during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| So if people were not able to come out in public, they could go online and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| And then we also had a meeting on Sunday afternoon in Gibbs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| So we tried to spread it out and give people many different ways to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| So your staff worked extremely hard to get the word out through news articles, press releases, e-blasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| The mayor had a weekly video where he made it aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| We made everyone aware in the briefings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| So it was really an all-hands-on-deck approach to make sure that everyone had an opportunity to participate that wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| The idea is that we'll continue to build that base moving forward so that we can get more people involved as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| But it was a very comprehensive effort to make people aware of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| And so, as I mentioned, if you want to go to the next slide, this was about listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| So we asked people for feedback in three very specific ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| We asked people at these meetings, what do you love about Knox County today that we should pay attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| and make sure that we preserve moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| As we grow as a county, what would make places better in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| What would you like to see change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| So how would you improve how people get around in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| And then we had a fourth category that was sort of a catch-all that wouldn't be captured in those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| So that's the way that we engaged the public and got their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| If you go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| We had over 300 participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| We gathered over 1,000 ideas, and almost 400 of those were map-based ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| And so there's data, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| But there's also we had a lot of personal conversations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| So there was a qualitative and a quantitative component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| I was out in Carter, had a great conversation with a woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| She said she was tired of driving into Knoxville to get groceries, so she wanted to see more opportunities out in Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| My colleagues were on the other side of the county in Hardin Valley, and they had a much different conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| That was more about concerns about school impacts and about future growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| I even had a couple of conversations with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Commissioner Schoonemaker, we had a nice conversation at North Shore Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| So I would love to have more conversations with you all too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| So I would encourage you to come out in future rounds of outreach and participate in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| So what did we learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| If you go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| So this is what people said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| This is why we came to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| This is why we chose to stay here is the natural setting, open space, parks and recreation, the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| Those are things you can't get elsewhere that draw people to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| So those are the things that really stood out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Directly tied into that was the small-town feel, that when you're in the county, you feel like you're still living in a small town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| even though you've got a lot of the amenities close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| And that's the other thing that people said that they liked is the fact that even though we can be in a small-town atmosphere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| we've got a lot of great cultural amenities very nearby, whether that's events, festivals, activities, all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| I'm not sure if UT football games would qualify as a cultural amenity, but that would be an example, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| And then people, the sense of civic pride, friendliness, neighborliness, all those types of things are what we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| We also – next slide – we have that graphically available in maps, too, so you can see where the comments came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| I won't go into a lot of detail today, but we do have a summary where you can see specifically where some of the comments came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| and you can see some trends that popped out on the map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| So we are – as I mentioned, we're sort of – we're wrapping up that phase, but we're not quite done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| I would encourage all of you on your networks to share the website, advanceknots.org, that you see up on the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| or take a picture right now with your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Please get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| We still have opportunities to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| on the website and other forms of information, so please help us get the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| All right, so we're now in the process of shifting gears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| and we are wrapping up this first round where we learned about where the county has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| We talked to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| If you go to the next slide, we are now, as spring and summer approaches, we're going to shift gears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| and we're going to start thinking about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| And so that's what is going to happen next is that we're going to start to look at future trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| and we're also going to start to ask specific questions about our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| And if you go to the next slide, the way that we're going to do that is through what's called a scenario planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| And so this is where we get an opportunity to play a what-if game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| So we can figure out if we keep making the same decisions that we are today into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1689)|
| 0:28:15| what kind of future does that bring us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| What if we change the way that we build places in the future or that we provide transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| What would happen to our future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Does Knox County become more affordable or less affordable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Does my friend in Carter have an opportunity to shop there without going into Knoxville or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| How will schools be impacted in Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| All those types of things that we get to answer through a scenario planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| That's the next step that we'll be entering into in the spring and into the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| And then in the fall we're going to have that next round of outreach once we get the findings from that scenario planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| So we're really excited for that, and we hope that you will be too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| I believe that's the end of my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| So I'm going to stop and thank you first for your time and see if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| Thank you very much for that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| It was very helpful and informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I'm going to recognize Commissioner Jay, and then Daly, and then Buster just right down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| It looks like we're on the right track so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| It's a long process to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| My question is, at least the sessions I attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| the attendance, although engaged, is pretty low compared to the greater depth of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| Even if you add up everybody, I would say you probably had less than, what, 200 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| Maybe close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Would that be ballpark for the whole week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| We had between 300 and 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| Okay, so let's assume everybody tonight watching at home clicks on their phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and we even double that number, and it might be 1,000 people that participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| In a county of 480,000 people, how do you balance those who showed up and participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| and gave feedback versus other variables that sort of take in the larger community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| I'm a big proponent if you want to participate and you want to have your voice heard, great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| but it also – the reality of it is there's a whole lot more people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| So how do you – when you get through your report, how do you sort of balance the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Because if you only ever took into consideration the 500 to 1,000 people that showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| you might skew one hard direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| If you didn't listen to them at all, you might skew the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| and somewhere there's a fine balance in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| So first, I think the first thing is that we – this was the first of three rounds of outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| so we'll learn and refine, and as people learn more about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| our goal is to double that number in the future to get more people out and engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| It's generally hard to get people to come out to a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| unless it's an issue that immediately affects their near term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| it's really hard to get people to come out and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| But that said, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| We need to balance that with the fact that that represents a very small percentage of the overall population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| So we're using it very qualitatively to help inform the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| and we're also balancing it from feedback that we get from you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| that we get from the advisory and technical committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| which also hear from their constituents outside of the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| So we balance that with trying to get feedback from a range of different sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| That's why we presented the numbers here to you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| so you would have the context to know how many people actually participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Could you send this presentation to Drew so she can share it, so I can share it on my pages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| And I think you guys, you have it back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| so I don't know if there's a way we can distribute it to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| I was trying to figure out how you could get more participation in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and I was looking at some things that I go throughout in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| And I have two communities out there, one's Powell, one's Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| and we have an active business and professional association in both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| In fact, tomorrow at 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| we'll be having a business and professional meeting at Beaverbrook Country Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| where we can get information out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| And then Powell's already happened this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| So there's things out there we can get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| And once you get to those people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| they can put signs up in their businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| and probably reach and touch more people than we would with normally newspaper ads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| and these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| and get these business professionals out there pitching this deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=1965)|

| 0:39:21| I don't have a lot to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| My resume is in the hands of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| and I think that if there is any questions based off of my resume or my curriculum vitae, I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| My community involvement is vast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I run a nonprofit in east Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| We do a lot of community work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I've been in the community for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| I'm a former Tennessee State Trooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I was with the Highway Patrol for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| I worked in youth development for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| I'm currently Rule 31 as a mediator with Tennessee Supreme Court here in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| both in civil and general mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| and we have, through our nonprofit, done a lot of mediation for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| a lot of mediation through Knox County schools, communities that are looking for advocates to speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2415)|
| 0:40:25| And so, again, I don't have a lot to offer other than what my resume speaks for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| my community involvement, my awards that I've received throughout the years for my community participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| I think I'd make a great addition to the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Having served as an officer with the Highway Patrol, having been in that position for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| I think I understand what Knox County employees in that position would be wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| and how best to serve their interests and how best to protect their interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| So I'm open for questions if there's any from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you, Mr. Dingus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Mr. Dingus, thank you for your service as a State Trooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| We actually opened a new headquarters today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| and I wanted to know in your time as a State Trooper, did they have a similar type of program on a statewide level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2477)|
| 0:41:27| and have you ever been involved with that or had any interaction with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| How would it be similar or different from, you know, experience on the local level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| So during my tenure, and I think it's changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| but you were an employee of the state which you had rights that allowed you to process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2505)|
| 0:41:55| and you could go before a panel, and whether or not they had a merit system at that particular level, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| And so I couldn't answer that with any validity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Mr. Dingus, what would be your approach to handling any grievance that would come before you as a Merit Council member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| Well, I think it's important that any grievance that comes before anybody about employment first goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2539)|
| 0:42:29| it should first go through its chain of command.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| And so they should be able to work it out at the lowest level before it becomes an issue where it is a formal complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| At such time that that complaint came before me, I think my decision-making would be based off the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| of whatever both parties said, and being able to weigh that with my council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| I think the decision could be made going forward on whatever we decided to do at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| It's important to have due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| It's extremely important to have due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| No one should be dismissed from their employment without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| Everyone has a voice, whether right or the wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| There's always two sides to the story, and then there's the truth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| And so we want to be able to weigh through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| As a mediator, I often tell people when we go into mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| everybody wants to 100% expect not to walk out with what you want when you walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| And so there's a mediation process to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| And so I'm sure that all grievances being looked at from a merit council position has to weigh what the career employee is bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2612)|
| 0:43:46| to the table in terms of his grievance and his supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| And so those things will have to be weighed out as they come before the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Mr. Dinkins, I'm going to ask this question of all the applicants tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| I'm going to ask these questions of all the applicants tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Have you ever ran for public office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Do you intend to run for public office in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| That would be the honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| I don't have that in my wheelhouse right now, but I have run for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| I do believe that part of serving your community is standing out in front of it and taking charge and taking on those hard issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2663)|
| 0:44:32| I did run and run unsuccessfully, but I don't have that in my wheelhouse to run at this particular moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Have you ever been a paid employee or a volunteer on someone else's campaign besides yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| Not a paid employee, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Volunteer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Many campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Commissioner Dirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I thought of one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Are you aware of the pending litigation that is currently facing the merit council, and would you be willing to put yourself on a lawsuit if you were a part of, did become, in fact, a member of the merit system council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2700)|
| 0:45:16| I don't understand that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Let me rephrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| There is currently a pending lawsuit against the merit system council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Are you willing to be named in a lawsuit as a respondent if you were, in fact, appointed to this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2723)|
| 0:45:35| In other words, you would be listed on a pending lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| If it's part of the merit council board and we are on there as a respondent, the answer would be yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2740)|
| 0:45:50| Any further questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you, Mr. Dingus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Next, we have Paul Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| Good evening, Mr. Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Sir, if you would state your name and address for the clerk's record, and you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| My name is Paul Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| I'm living at 6906 Newbert Springs Road in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| Could you move just a little bit closer to the microphone, Mr. Huff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Paul Huff, 6906 Newbert Springs Road, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| I'm an engineer by trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| I've been in the engineering and construction business for 41 years, five years with Jack Flint, six years with Barge Wagner, and the last 30 years with Bechtel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2792)|
| 0:46:43| I've designed and constructed projects all over the country and in four continents across the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| Every project I've ever been involved in is based on merit, so I'm not a stranger to decisions based on merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2811)|
| 0:46:59| So that's pretty much second nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| In my 30-plus years with Barge Wagner and Bechtel, I was involved in a number of dispute resolutions with contractors, owners, internal with employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2823)|
| 0:47:19| I've had to hire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| I've had to fire people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| I much prefer to hire people than fire them, but I understand the pain that that causes, and I'm sympathetic to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2844)|
| 0:47:33| But again, those decisions are based on merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| I bring no agendas to any issue that I look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| I look at things from a purely logical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| I don't know if I can tell you much else about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| I've recently moved back to Knox County from out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| I want Knox County to be my home from now on, and I am applying to this appointment because of my deep respect for law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2879)|
| 0:48:11| and the sacrifices that law enforcement employees make on my behalf and on behalf of everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| And I guess I can take questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| Thank you, Mr. Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Hello, Mr. Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| I'm going to ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| Have you ever ran for public office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Do you have any intentions of running for public office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Have you ever worked on any campaign as a volunteer or paid employee in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Commissioner Durich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Hi, Mr. Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| I also am going to ask the same questions that I asked the previous candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| What will be your approach to handling grievances that come before the Merit System Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| I would look at the facts, the issues, the facts, the merits of the arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| and the rules that everyone is playing by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| And I would weigh those against the issues that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| and make a decision that hopefully will be – it will be like most mediations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2959)|
| 0:49:28| Not everybody will be happy, but it will be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| And are you aware of the pending lawsuit that is currently facing the Merit System Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| So there is the possibility of you being named in said lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| if you were to be appointed to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Are you willing to still remain as a candidate for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| I don't want to appear cagey, but I would have to look at the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| I would have to look at the issues around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| and determine what liability would be placed on me as a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| having no idea whatever what the lawsuit is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| I couldn't say yes or no at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you so much for your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Thank you, Mr. Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Next is Chris Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3023)|
| 0:50:35| Good evening, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| If you'll state your name and address for the clerk's record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Christopher John Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| I live at 7000 Westland Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| I believe I bring a unique experience to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| I served as a police officer for 35 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| unfortunately, in the state of California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| We moved here six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| During that tenure, the department I worked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| the employees is what's referred to as a closed shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| In other words, you have to be a member of the union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| That represents from the sergeants down to the officer rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| And at one point, excuse me, for seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| I served on the board of directors of the union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| I actually served in the capacity of president for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| Three of the years I served as a grievance chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And in the process regarding discipline and demotions in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| there's a grievance procedure where you're represented by a union member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| and also an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| So I had a lot of opportunity to learn about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| And as my career progressed, I served in management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| and was involved on the other side where discipline was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| And then at certain times I was directed to go ahead and deliver the discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| I always viewed that job as the aspect of reasonableness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| I don't believe discipline is about punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| It's about training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| And you want to correct the behavior and train the officer in such a manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| that they will follow the proper procedure in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| and not have to be dealt with in a disciplinary manner in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| So my attitude was always to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| or recommend a reasonable amount of corrective action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| so that that result would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| And I'm available for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Thank you, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Commissioners, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Welcome back, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| You applied last time we made an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| And you bring a significant amount of experience to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Since that time, have you had a chance to observe, engage with the Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| and watch any of the hearings proceedings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| I just wanted to see what your ñ I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| I have watched a couple of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| but quite honestly in the last year I've had the opportunity to become involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| with the second grandchild,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| so I'm providing day care 8 to 5 Monday through Friday with my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| So, honestly, I haven't seen as many as I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I'm not sure who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Hi, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| What would be your approach to handling grievances that come before the Merit System Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| What would be your approach to handling any grievances that would come before the Merit System Council if appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| So I believe the council's charge is to weigh all the aspects not only of the appeal or grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3233)|
| 0:54:03| but also of the management view of what they're trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| and basically just apply a level of reasonableness to the weighing of the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3249)|
| 0:54:22| As one of the other candidates mentioned, my idea, you want to try and build a consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| which means that pretty much nobody's happy with the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| They don't get exactly everything they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| And you said you have watched a couple of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| Are you aware that there is a pending lawsuit against the Merit System Council at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| I am aware that there is a pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| but I didn't have all of the information regarding the aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Would you be willing to be named in said lawsuit if appointed to this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Thank you, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I'm going to ask you basically the same questions and then one additional question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| Have you ever ran for office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Do you have any intentions of running for office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Have you ever worked as a paid employee or as a volunteer on any campaigns in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| I volunteered for Eddie McManus' mayoral campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| As you said, you have a new grandchild, and as Commissioner Jay pointed out, this is your second time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| What is your driving motivation for coming back and wanting to be a part of this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| Well, I have an obligation to serve the community that I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| I mean, I did that for 35 years as a paid person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| but I also believe that your obligation doesn't stop if the paycheck stops you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| If you want to contribute and make it a better place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| you participate where you can put your skill sets to work and make the county better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| And looking at your resume, this is an area that you are definitely qualified for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3373)|

| 0:56:27| Evening, Mr. Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| You'll state your name and address for the clerk's record, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| My name is John Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| I live at 6408 Springview Lane in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| I've resided there for over 37 years with my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| We have three grown kids and four grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| and they're in the Gibbs community attending schools there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| I'm fully retired at this time, so I have no other obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| So I'm able to give full time to this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| I come from a law enforcement family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I think many of you already know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| My father was police chief here in Knoxville during the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| My great-great-grandfather was a sheriff of Ray County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| So I'm fully aware of the law enforcement community and what their needs and things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| I spent ten years when I got out of school in the insurance industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I've attended the ATF School for Arson Investigation, so I'm aware of all the investigating needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| I've been serving on the Merit Council as an alternate member for the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| so I'm up to date on everything that's going on with the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| I've attended every single meeting, and I've participated in several officer reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| In 1982, I was part of a team of three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| and we handled all the loss management for the World's Fair here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| So I'm used to working with organizations and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| I spent ten years in the Tennessee Air National Guard 119th control flight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| NCOIC, in charge of stand-eval for that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| Stand-eval, we gave the testing and took the testing results up the chain of command for people's promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| so I'm aware of that procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| In order to better understand the workings of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| I have completed the Elected Officials Academy Level I with Municipal Technical Advisory over at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| and I intend to take more of those classes to help me understand how to work with government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| I feel that politics has no place in the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| I think all the decisions that the Merit Council makes should be fact-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| based on what the situation is, what's presented for the grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| You all have got my resume. That's basically it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| Thank you, Mr. Marshall. Any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3521)|

| 0:58:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| Thank you, Mr. Marshall. I'm going to ask you the same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Have you ever ran for office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3535)|

| 0:58:58| I have no intentions of seeking office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| Have you ever volunteered or been a paid employee of a campaign in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| I have volunteered in many campaigns in Knoxville over the years, never as a paid individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| Okay. How recently? How recently have you volunteered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3550)|

| 0:59:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Mr. Marshall, you basically answered my question of how you would handle a grievance with looking at facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| and going with a fair approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| And I do know since you are the current alternate member of the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| that you are aware of the pending lawsuit against the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| However, you are not currently named in the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| so would you be willing to be named in the lawsuit if you were appointed to a full member position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| If that is the appropriate legal position, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Mr. Marshall, as an alternate member for the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3606)|
| 1:00:14| is there a way you might summarize what's the most important thing that you've learned as an alternate member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| that you would apply if you were installed as a full voting member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| Follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| That's basically it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| Do you want to elaborate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Well, the Merit Council has a set of rules and regulations that need to be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| in reference to how a grievance procedure is supposed to be handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| and those things are there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| It's there to make sure that there is no outside influence on decisions made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| whenever a member of the Sheriff's Department comes forward with a grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| and I feel that when a grievance is accepted to be heard, it needs to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| not taking a year or longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3673)|

| 1:01:59| and before I sent my resume in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| I decided I would go ahead and read the Knox County Merit Board's rules and regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| as well as the Knox County Commission's resolutions and rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| because if you're going to judge, you have to be fair and open when you're hearing both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| but you also have to follow the instructions set down in the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| After leaving the police department, I did a couple of years as a chaplain with Chaplains USA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3750)|

| 1:04:05| Thank you very much, Mr. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3845)|

| 1:04:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| Mr. Mitchell, thank you for applying in your service as an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| When you spent two terms on the Civil Service Merit Board for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| what is one or two things that you took away from that that you feel like are the most important things you could bring to our Knox County merit system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3861)|
| 1:04:35| One of the big things I remember surmising is that generationally there is a different interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3875)|
| 1:04:47| and a different feeling on rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| Some generations are very strict about this is the way it's written and this is the way it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| Others are more lenient and willing to bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| Part of that still has to go back to listening to both sides, finding out why the rules and regulations were set in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3904)|
| 1:05:14| and doing some investigative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3914)|

| 1:05:28| and then you need to be able to sit down and decipher was this really an answer to this complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| or was this question answered fully or just partially and do a little more investigation if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3937)|
| 1:05:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3951)|

| 1:06:07| I don't know if you'd call it volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| It wasn't in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| When I was in high school, my dad ran for city council in Nashville, and we were put to work, my brother and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=3971)|

| 1:06:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| And are you willing to be named in that lawsuit if you are, in fact, appointed to this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| If appointed to the board, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4009)|

| 1:07:50| I've worked three years in patrol, three years as an SRO at Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4070)|

| 1:08:22| I think in order to be fair, you have to have understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| You have to have life experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Without going into details, you know, I grew up poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4108)|

| 1:08:43| the men and women of the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4123)|

| 1:08:55| so you need to look at all the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| But I think we need a system in place to let those officers, those fine men and women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| understand that they have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4144)|

| 1:09:54| My question is do you feel that you would have an inherent conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| or be put in a hard position being a current officer in an agency that's quite close together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4200)|
| 1:10:09| and cooperates across jurisdictional lines and be put into a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| where you might be too far inside of the bubble there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| That's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I've thought about that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| I've talked to my wife about it, and that's something that could possibly come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| I am familiar with people at the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4225)|

| 1:10:40| That's a possibility that could arise, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4240)|

| 1:11:01| You've got to take a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4261)|

| 1:11:07| Sometimes they say if you want to be fair, sometimes you've got to go the TV and eye affair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| That's off of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| But honestly, you've got to look at both sides of the fence, and you've got to be impartial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| There's no way in the world we should ever bring politics into the decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4283)|

| 1:13:06| So I deal with dealing with problems on a regular basis on a different level with a lot of legalities that are involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| and I'm a firm believer, yes, there are two sides to every story, but in reality, there's three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| and working together to get to the honest truth and finding out what needs to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| Most recently for me, not only taking care of Turkey Creek, I've become a U.S. citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4402)|
| 1:13:30| So in 2020, I was naturalized as a U.S. citizen from Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| I have family background in the police area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Although I'm a citizen, I have not been involved with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| My uncle was the commissioner of the OPP in Ontario, as well as the chief of police in Windsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| and each, as you've read my resume, I've had the opportunity of living and working in different marketplaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| including Manhattan, Cleveland, Ohio, Reno, Nevada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| and in each marketplace, I realized that you need to develop a relationship with local authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| and working with them, not only in the things that we do, but in working with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| And in the last six years, we developed a relationship on the property with the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| and all of their team, as well as KPD, with a substation, which is located in our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| And I value those relationships with those officers because they put a lot of time and effort into the property and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| And the bottom line is we work together to develop an area, and understanding those problems, we figure them out together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4466)|
| 1:14:35| So, any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, Mr. Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you, Mr. Whitehead, for replying, not to sound like a broken record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| However, I will ask you the same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Number one, what will be your approach to handling any grievance that would come before the Merit System Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| It's looking at each side of that grievance and understanding the merits of the grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| and applying the direct approach to understanding what needs to happen and getting – you're not going to make everyone happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4500)|
| 1:15:10| But at the same time, there is the right way to do it, and you have to understand all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| There's three sides to that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| And are you aware of the pending lawsuit that is against the Merit System?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| And would you be willing to be named in that if you are appointed to this full member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I just want to – great question, Commissioner Durrett, on the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| Once you Google your name, you will find that in the past I've been sued on PCA and other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4540)|
| 1:15:48| It's kind of weird when you Google and you see your name under a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| I just want to thank all seven of you for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| In today's atmosphere and the negativity and you will not – the two that are appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| you're probably not going to be alive for any of that on certain issues, certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| But I am just amazed that we had seven candidates to come out and be willing to take on this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4570)|
| 1:16:19| to serve the community, and I applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| Well, let me tell you, one of the statements you made about in the current times we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| that's one of the reasons why after – I'd have to do my math, but in 1983,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| when I received my green card and moved to the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| why did it take me so long to be a citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| It takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| You have to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| It's really easy to make the comment from the cheap seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| It's tougher to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| And on the legality side, I've been named in several lawsuits in my line of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| It's kind of the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Thank you, Mr. Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I'm going to ask you the same questions, and I have an additional question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| based upon the information you provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| Have you ever ran for office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| No, I couldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| I knew the answer to that question before I asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| Do you have any intentions of ever running for office in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Have you ever volunteered or been a paid employee of any campaign in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| You said that the property that you manage houses a substation for the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| Do you see any conflict with that with you serving on Merit Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| None whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| They're my tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Mr. Whitehead, congratulations on your citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| And when I first got on commission in 2015, one of my first goals was to find a satellite office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| for the Knox County Sheriff's Office in the Farragut community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| And I was going in one direction, and some folks were going in another direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| and it's a good thing that they landed on your doorstep because that's been a great improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| to have that office out there in the Turkey Creek development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| So I just want to personally say thank you for allowing that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Every one of them up there is a wonderful asset to not only the community but to our centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| This is not of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| Thank you, though, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| This is directed to Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Following up on Commissioner Durrett's questions about the legality lawsuits, twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4721)|
| 1:18:50| Would someone who is newly appointed to this board automatically be a part of a lawsuit that has already been filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4730)|
| 1:19:00| And number two, would you explain the blanket liability or general liability that those of us that serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4740)|
| 1:19:10| who have been appointed in elected positions have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| Well, I understand the lawsuit that's being referred to is a declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| There's no liability that would accrue to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| This is a lawsuit asking a court to declare whether or not the Merit Council, as it's currently constituted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| is a legally constituted body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| So there is no liability that would accrue to any member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| The members of the board are named because they are considered to be indispensable parties as members of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| But they're named only in their professional, their official capacity, not in their individual capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| So there's nothing for anyone on that board to fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| Speaking to your second question, generally speaking, when you're acting in your official capacity as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4793)|
| 1:20:03| or as an employee of the county, you're covered by the governmental court liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| which the county as the employer would be the entity if there was any liability in a situation that would be exposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4808)|
| 1:20:17| generally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Civil rights action is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| But I just want to make it real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| This litigation does not imperil any member of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| There's no liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Nobody's suing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| They are merely named because they are members of the body whose existence is being questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Is there anything that distinguishes an appointed person from an elected person as far as the governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| No, not from a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Moyers, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| Thank you, Mr. Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4858)|

| 1:21:05| I think I want to do something I should have done about 30 minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| and entertain a motion to move this item forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4869)|

| 1:22:27| youth sports activities and related concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| And in exchange for the use of Bower Field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| Knox County will pay an amount equal to the yearly Knox County property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| on the undeveloped property adjacent to Bower Field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4959)|

| 1:23:08| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| Motion to approve by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| Commissioner Daley, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| I'd like to introduce John Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Come on down, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5001)|

| 1:23:26| He can tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| I know it's Bower Field and the Last Resort Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| I'm not sure what the third F is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| John is our new president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| And I'm going to brag on John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| John and Austin and the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| I've been to several of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| They're doing a fantastic job, so I'm not going to steal his thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| I'm going to let him tell you what's happening at Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Sir, if you would, for the clerk's record, just state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| John Lane, 216 Abner Cruise Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| That's in South Knoxville, approximately seven minutes from Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Like Mr. Daley said, I appreciate you all allowing me time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| I'm the president of Bower Field Athletic Association, BFAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| which was established in the fall of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| I oversee a board of nine people, including myself, a field director, secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| treasurer, community liaison, and four age commissioners based on our youth groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| Bower Field has six fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| We have, this season, over 360 ballplayers, which represents South Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| Blount County, and Sevier County, based on the proximity of the ballpark at 8744 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| One thing that we wanted to ensure happened when we took over in the fall of 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| is that the local kids had a safe and fun experience at Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| We wanted to make sure it was a place where they could establish memories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| Growing up, I was a huge fan of baseball, playing baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| and the best memories of my childhood is how that game made me feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| It wasn't about wins or losses or how many times I struck out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| but the feeling I had leaving the ballpark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| that's what we want our children to have at our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| We're also trying to make sure that we're transparent with any funds that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| We are 100% giving back to our ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Since we've taken over in the fall, we have given back over $25,000 through field improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| new dirt on our fields, new scoreboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Sorry, not scoreboards, but score signs for our fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| New concessions, Wi-Fi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| We're trying to make it a good experience so when the families come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| they see that their money is being used and put back inside what we consider to be our ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| One thing we did find, I've been at Bower since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| I have four sons that have either played or continue to play there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| My twin sons are 21. They umpire now at Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| My 13-year-old plays for South Dole Middle School, and my youngest still plays at Bower Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| We wanted to make sure that we were transparent with any funds that we brought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| so we regularly update the public with what we are working on and what we're working towards with our ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5162)|
| 1:26:10| Thank you very much, sir. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| We have a motion. Oh, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| This is really a question for Commissioner Daley. I think you have the most knowledge on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| Can you explain the relationship between Bower Field and Thunder Mountain Properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| This is not a new lease agreement, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| This has been a well-established relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| It is. Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| It's a new agreement between Thunder Mountain and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| because in the previous, it was under the Seymour athletic, Seymour women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| From my understanding, Bower Field was leased to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| Knox County then sublet it to the Seymour Optimist Club, which ran the baseball and softball organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| And then in 2020, Arch and Rick decided that they're going to change some things around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5223)|
| 1:27:11| and the Seymour Athletic Association went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| They had a vote, a membership vote, and these nine commissioners come on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| Which in turn, since it was a new organization, we had to update the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Which took us a pretty good while, back and forth, with lawyers getting together and ready to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| So we finally got that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| So to answer your question, Mr. Ben Bowers leased the property for taxes since 1976, 74, 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5254)|
| 1:27:45| And then the new lease agreement since the property was sold is between Thunder Mountain Realty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| or Thunder Mountain Corporation, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| Which is still connected to the Bower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| Yeah. Chris Arnold is the grandson of Ben Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| I'd say Commissioner Daley probably can answer this question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| Because Knox County does not own the property, that is why we're able to give a 10-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| I mean, they can do a 10-year lease, and Knox County Parks and Recreation will allow them to do sporting events on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5303)|
| 1:28:33| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| I'm going to say correct, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| Because my other question is if – oh, I didn't see –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| Here comes Joe, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Okay. I couldn't see the other chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| We as Knox County can't use the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Yes. Okay. Joe, do you mind coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| I didn't see Joe here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Good evening, Mr. Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| Good evening. Joseph Mack, Senior Director of Parks and Recreation for Knox County, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| To answer your question, basically the way the lease agreement works is that the nonprofit organization then enters into a user agreement with Knox County for the length of the lease to use the property for youth sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5348)|
| 1:29:26| Okay. But hypothetically, if Knox County owned that property, we would probably only give an association a five-year lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5366)|
| 1:29:36| Actually, the lease is – the user agreements actually run no longer than the length of the mayor's current term is what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5376)|

| 1:31:01| This is resolution 802. Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5461)|

| 1:31:13| Yes. I would like to ask Tim Hill to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5473)|

| 1:31:27| Good evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Tim Hill, 6505 Orchard Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| I know this project has been getting a lot of media attention, and I just kind of want you to discuss what you're doing and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5494)|
| 1:31:42| Well, gladly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| To summarize the project, it's approximately $27 million, replacing a surface parking lot with mixed-use development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5504)|
| 1:31:52| approximately 53 residential units, four of which will be workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| and then we'll have approximately 22,000 square feet of restaurant retail space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5519)|
| 1:32:06| and a pedestrian thoroughfare through the center of an outdoor space in the middle of the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5526)|
| 1:32:16| We have one facing Gay Street, the pedestrian thoroughfare running north and south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| and then we have the residential building backing up to the Crown Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5541)|
| 1:32:29| I'm definitely in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| I'm very proud that there will be some affordable, I guess, housing, workforce housing in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| and it makes me very proud, and I hope that other projects like this will happen downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| especially when we have a stadium coming and giving people the opportunity to live downtown who can't afford it otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5561)|
| 1:32:50| And just one more question, just for my feel-good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| Why did you name it Caldonia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Well, I tell you, I thought that we were doing a nice, respectful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| We were naming it after Cal Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| We've gotten some mixed feedback about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| Hopefully, we can continue with that name, but if it appears controversial, we may choose to rename it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| just so that we can satisfy the masses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Yeah, well, for people that don't know, that's where Cal Johnson had his loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| Loan Tree Saloon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Loan Tree Saloon, and Cal Johnson was one of the first black millionaires of post-slavery in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| That's exactly right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| So that was a nod to Cal Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| And I would just add one other thing about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| If you went out into many of the suburbs and tried to put, let's say, 53 residential units out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5620)|
| 1:33:48| and 22,000 square feet of retail, it would probably take approximately 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| So we're doing this on a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| I don't have any more questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5641)|

| 1:34:04| I think this is a great opportunity to take a parking lot and now turn it into residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| particularly one on such a vocal corner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| Has the City of Knoxville already signed off on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| They'll be voting at City Council tomorrow night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5659)|

| 1:37:41| The reason for that is sort of the background of how the Merit System Council came into being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| It originally was created by private act, and that was perfectly fine, but then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| state legislature in 1974 established a statewide program for Merit System Councils for sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| Anybody who had a private act, like Knox County, was grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| When the charter government came around in 1990, however, the private act went away, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| instead an ordinance was adopted that provided for the Merit System Council and all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| local rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Both Knox County and Shelby County have those Merit System Councils created by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| They're not operating under the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| The issue has arisen because after 1974, the allegation is that the power to create a Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5905)|
| 1:38:33| System Council was only under the state law, and in order to adopt the state law for Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| System Councils, the county commission of a given county has to adopt that law by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Knox County Commission has never done that because it was believed that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| replaced the need for that state law to be adopted, but the law director came forth with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| an opinion that he believed that the Merit System Council was not appropriately constituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| Therefore, because the law director's office was representing the sheriff who brought the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| lawsuit in the cold matter, I was brought in to represent the Merit Council due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Subsequently, it became apparent that the county was going to need to be added to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| lawsuit because its ordinance was being questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| Normally in a lawsuit, if an ordinance is being questioned, whoever adopted the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| as a body gets to come and be a party to the lawsuit to defend itself or to state its position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| regarding its ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Approximately two weeks ago, the law director's office answered for Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| and said, yes, we agree with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| The ordinance is not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| And so that puts the Merit System Council in a difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| We still can certainly provide a defense, and I think we have a good one in the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| but when the very body that promulgated the ordinance says that it's not valid in a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=5996)|
| 1:40:03| it makes it difficult for us to say, no, no, no, you're wrong about your own ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| It is valid for these reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| One thing that could cure this would be if this commission did adopt the state law, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| is TCA 88401 at SEC, and that's the state law providing for Merit System Councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| And if that were adopted, this whole problem about whether or not the Merit System Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| in Knox County is legal would essentially be resolved moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| So that's one thing I just wanted to let you know is out there as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| It's also been mentioned by the law director's office as a good possibility to get this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| The concern would be that if we move forward with the lawsuit and with Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| through the law director's office agreeing that the ordinance is not good, if the court agrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| and strikes the ordinance, then there is no Merit System Council for Knox County in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| because it doesn't exist under state law and it would not exist under ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| So, again, we think we have good defenses, but now we're in a bit of a box because of that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| that's been taken, saying that, yes, we agree as the county commission that our own ordinance is not good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| and was not properly adopted back in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| Because, basically, at that point, if you were going to have a Merit System Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| it had to be done under state law because that's what that 1974 law provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| as to how to have a Merit System Council in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| So that's the quandary that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| Recently the Merit System Council had a meeting and decided to no longer have hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| until such time as this case has been adjudicated because they're afraid if they do not have power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| that they don't want to move forward with that question hanging out in the air to continue to hear cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| So, right now, they're not proceeding with any new cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| They're completing a case or two that they had in the hopper already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| but any new cases are being postponed until that case can be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| So that's sort of an update about the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| I think it would be good if the county commission could, at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| look at adopting that state law so that this is no longer a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| There are different rules under the state law than what are under the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| and I would think you would want an explanation of what the changes would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| But there is a way to get out from this problem and to make sure that moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| there's no longer a question about the validity of the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| Commissioner Durrett, is it okay with you if I recognize the other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| or do you still have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| I apologize. I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| A couple of questions for Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Thank you again for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| So when you say that Knox County Commission has, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| agreed that we think the merit system is invalid, what made you come to that assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6175)|
| 1:43:01| An answer was they basically filed a motion now saying this was not the proper procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| and that's pending before the court, but they purported to intervene in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| They are, I agree, a necessary party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| We question whether they should have filed a motion to intervene as opposed to just intervening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| And then an answer was filed to the complaint by Knox County that said, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| we agree with the position of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| So there was a filing in the lawsuit that set forth that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| So even if we get through the procedural hurdle that I'm talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| I have no reason to believe that that won't be ultimately the position that is taken by the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| for the county and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| And the reason for that question is because we as a body have not voted to invalidate the merit system at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6220)|
| 1:43:48| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| I know of no such action by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| I just wanted to make sure that Ms. Davis was aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| And so you are saying by the answer in the amendment, including the term Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6241)|
| 1:44:10| that Knox County Commission is, in fact, included as the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| Well, it's now a, it would be a defendant because the sheriff's office is the petitioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6255)|
| 1:44:23| and they would have additionally needed to name the county commission because its ordinance was at issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| You may address another, other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| I'll come back. I'll come back to you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Could you, I'm sorry, could you repeat your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Melanie Davis, and I'm an attorney at Kaiser and Black in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| And I have a lot of governmental experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| And you said you're the counsel for the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| Yes, it's the merit system counsel for the employees of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Which is essentially the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Yes, exactly, and that's because there was viewed to be a conflict where the sheriff's office was represented by the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| and then they were suing the merit council, which is also normally represented by the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| that if you had the law director's office on both sides that that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| So I was brought in as independent counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| By the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Yes, David Book is who hired me, but I'm independent as far as all of my judgments and decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| My understanding is that commission authorized that hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| Not me specifically, but hired an attorney for, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| I'm just trying to understand, so who hired you to represent the counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| David Book asked me to do it, and I represented the counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| And that is, I'm assuming, then paid for out of his budget of outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6349)|
| 1:45:56| Would that be it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| I don't know who's paying. I suspect that we are, but I don't know for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| Thank you. I just wanted to start back at the beginning because we haven't all met you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| Yeah, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| So we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| But that's who I represent, and it's just in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| The law director's office still represents the merit counsel on a day-to-day basis in their hearings that they were having before the decision was made a couple weeks ago to stop those hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6372)|
| 1:46:21| So I just represent them on these cases, not generally, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| I'm just representing them in the lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Okay, just in the lawsuits, not the grievances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Not the grievances. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| That's still the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| So the law director and the law department still would be their counsel as it relates to the grievances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Which I know is still a point of convention because they still hired additional counsel when their own counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| So we have a third counsel now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Okay. But, yes, I represent them in the two lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| And then we have the legal counsel that the counsel hired when they didn't agree with their own counsel, and now we have a third counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6417)|
| 1:47:07| So I'm just trying to better understand who's doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| I'm just trying to stay in my lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| So my big question is who's representing us since we're named in this lawsuit, the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| Are you representing us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| No, definitely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| It would be the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| So the law director is suing us and also representing us in response as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| The law director represents the sheriff and represents the county on both sides, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| And then answered for us without even talking to any of us as a representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| I'm unaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| You're unaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| I'm unaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| I know that the county law director's office represents the county and all its component entities in every legal matter that transpires for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6463)|
| 1:47:53| How this came about, I'm unfortunately not aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| So who is aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| Mr. Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| He's the only one aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| I'm sure there are other people in the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| Remember, I'm recently back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| Houston Havestay, I believe, has been intimately involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| So when were we going to be notified that we're getting sued by our own county as the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| And then when we're going to be notified about answering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| Because I don't know what anybody's going to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Has this come before anybody that we said, hey, we're not following our own ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| We don't care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| I mean, it's a little bit ‑‑ I don't know what the right word is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| I don't want to ‑‑ I mean, embarrassing, corrupt, ridiculous, I don't know which word you want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| But there's a couple of them I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| And I'm a little hot, so I'm going to take a deep breath and let you guys talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| Well, I'm going to recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker and Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| But no, the first I heard of this being stated as the opinion position of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6528)|
| 1:49:00| us being the legislative body of Knox County, was when I received a copy of the filings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6540)|
| 1:49:08| So I don't know as ‑‑ I understand that county commission is not a ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| we're not the legal counsel for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| And this is a legal proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| But we are the legislative body, and I don't know if it's customary for the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| to state something as the position of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you, and then back to Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| I mean, the law director's office has the option to hire additional counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| when they feel there's a conflict in house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| And I'm assuming that's what's transpired in your case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| But the law director's office is going to, on any ordinance that we pass whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6593)|
| 1:50:03| they're going to defend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| They don't come to commission and say, hey, we want to defend this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Can we have your permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| I don't think I've ever heard of that in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| They're not defending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| They're not defending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| They're saying it doesn't rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| So, again, we probably need to wait until next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| when the law director is here present to get these answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6628)|
| 1:50:38| Commissioner Durrett, we're back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| Director Moyers, you were in the law department in the 90s and in the 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| Yes, a long, long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| So in 1990 is when the ordinances were, in fact, adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| That created the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| So what is your take on all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| I put him in a bad position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| I am an employee of the Knox County Law Director's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| and I take my direction from Law Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| I appreciate your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| I've been in politics for a while, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| So Ms. Davis referenced the County Sheriff's Civil Service Law of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| Regarding that issue and us adopting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| if we did, in fact, rule that the ordinances that created the Merit System Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| that we as a body created once we became a charter government are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| invalid due to the charter being ruled de facto, because that's really the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| The validity of the ordinances that created the Merit System Council is because we operate as a de facto charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| No, not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| As I understand the litigation, and this is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6713)|
| 1:52:00| there is a provision in the charter that says that the county does not have the authority to reduce the powers of the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| Only the legislature can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| The powers of the sheriff are as set forth in the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Now, under common law, the sheriff has an absolute right to transfer, terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6731)|
| 1:52:19| Tennessee is an at-will employment state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| In the absence of a merit council, the sheriff would have the absolute power to terminate, transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| do whatever he wanted with any employee just like any other private employee would have the right to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| When the charter was adopted, there was a provision in the early part of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6751)|
| 1:52:38| that basically says that all private acts in Platanox County are repealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| and then those private acts were replaced with ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| The question that arises here is when the county commission or when the charter adoption repealed the private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6767)|
| 1:52:56| and then the county commission passed an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| was that an act by the county commission to limit the powers of the sheriff in a way that's repugnant to that provision of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6779)|
| 1:53:06| that says that the county commission cannot limit the powers of the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| That's where the issue comes, and I think she's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| That's my understanding of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| And the issue about the power to enact it at all given the 1974 act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| Right, and that's exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| That once the private act was extinguished by the charter, that if we wanted to carry forward a merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| what this commission should do is adopt the 1974 Merit Council Act by two-thirds vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| and that would make the whole question go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| And I believe that that's what the merit council would like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| Frankly, I think, as I understand it, that's what the law director's office would like to see happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| is do that to put the act or the merit council on a good, solid legal footing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| so that it could not be changed or questioned going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| The reason for my question is because we have, in previous commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| been told that in Jordan v. Knox County in 2007 when it was ruled that, yes, in fact, we have been operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6843)|
| 1:54:13| I don't want to say illegally, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| Is it de facto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| We are a de facto charter, and therefore we are a de facto county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| and all ordinance that have been created since then are, in fact, de facto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| I can read you the summit summary if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| It's okay. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| So then my question then becomes if that is the actual reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| and we do declare the Merit System Council invalid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| wouldn't other ordinances such as the term limit amendment that was also a part of Jordan v. Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6884)|
| 1:54:52| also be considered invalid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| First of all, this is way more in the weeds than I was ready for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| My understanding is after the Jordan case was ruled on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| the county set to work fixing the charter by the adoption of several charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6907)|
| 1:55:14| that actually established the offices that the chancellor found were the reason that the county was lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6914)|
| 1:55:23| I don't know that it's been challenged, but I believe that in enacting those ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| we went from being de facto to being de jure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| At that point, I think that the county would address all the issues that the chancellor found to be wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6932)|
| 1:55:40| So I don't think that as we operate today, we would be considered a de facto county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| Secondly, the term limits provision was enacted not by the county commission but by a vote of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6947)|
| 1:55:56| It was an amendment to the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| So it stands in a completely different situation than the adoption of an ordinance as we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6959)|
| 1:56:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| I want to make sure I have this part correct because John said that the law department defends our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6979)|
| 1:56:28| In this case, they're not defending our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| They are saying that our ordinance is invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| I haven't seen that amendment, and honestly, Commissioner, I can't answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=6996)|
| 1:56:42| I wish that I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Commissioner Buch or Law Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| Is it not normal to give knowledge to those named in a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| I'm wondering if anybody here had been given knowledge that the commission had been named in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7011)|
| 1:57:00| And I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| You're saying now that the Mayor's Council's solution is for us to adopt a 1974 Act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| That's one of the solutions, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| One of the solutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| What are the other solutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| One other solution might be if the law director's office were to get separate counsel for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| I don't know if they would take a different stance in the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| But that would be something that would take a long time to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| And meanwhile, the Merit System Council is idle, as we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| It would be expensive, and in the end, you might get back to the same place where you would be anyway, adopting the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| The law department brought an ordinance to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| We were unsure here on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| We asked for an attorney general opinion, and we were informed that the attorney general would not be able to give us an opinion if there was a pending lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7066)|
| 1:57:58| You say there are things that are different between the 1974 Sheriff's and Merit Council Act and our current rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7078)|
| 1:58:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| Could you please give me – because we were told there was no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| There are just particular differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I would need to go through and list those and compare the two, but they are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| Can you highlight what the major difference is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| Just some of the procedures as far as who does appointments, who is the chair, how the chair gets appointed, those types of procedural things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7102)|
| 1:58:32| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| I remember a little bit about when Law Director Boot brought the solution to this problem to this body, and it said we would do away with the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7119)|
| 1:58:55| If I remember correctly, when I sat down in his office, I wanted to make sure it was true, and I'm just – this is from memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| It said if we would have done that and accepted the 1974 solution, which he had as a resolution before us, this would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7140)|
| 1:59:12| And we decided we wanted to hear from somebody else because we didn't think that that was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7152)|
| 1:59:20| But you're saying that was right, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| It is right as long as you understand, and I would maybe like to chart out the differences so that they were transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| But, yes, that would solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| And we decided no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| You remember we wanted to get somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| So we're here now that our law director gave us a solution to take care of the problem that we're having right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7178)|
| 1:59:46| And it's costing us money every day that we do that, and that could have been taken care of some time ago is what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7186)|
| 1:59:57| And I sat down – I don't know if any of you went up there and sat down and talked with David after we had that situation before us to find out what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7197)|
| 2:00:06| It was kind of confusing when it was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| And he sat down and explained it and showed me those different things that was going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| It may not be a legal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| I went, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| So we had this one way to do it, and I thought, well, so I just left it alone because it was convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7217)|
| 2:00:26| So it was convoluted to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| It was hard to understand that you had to do away with it to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| Yes, you would need to repeal the old ordinance and adopt the new state law in its place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| Well, the old state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Well, it's new – yeah, adopt the 1974 law, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| So we had to do away with what we had to get the old one, and it would have taken care of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| So that's where we're at really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| If you really think back on it, that's what we discussed then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| Commissioner Ward, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| Certainly, Commissioner Skinnecker, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7264)|
| 2:01:05| That was in November of this past year that he – was that November he brought that to us or December?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| December, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| December meeting, and then it was – he pulled it because people didn't want to do that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| I disagree with you, Commissioner Bussler, and I wish we had a more in-depth talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| The part that – I'm fine with creating a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| If we have a solution at hand, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| The part that I don't like is somebody answering – our own lawyer answering for us without defense of us is the part that I have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7293)|
| 2:01:43| Not whether we should adopt it or not adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| That doesn't matter as much as – that's the part that does not sit right with me is you're suing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| and then answering for us in a sense to weaken our own defense of ourselves, which is just kind of like –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7311)|
| 2:01:58| it's like if me as a business owner be hiring a lawyer to sue me and then also defend me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| but when he goes to defend me, he then goes and says, well, hey, we don't believe in our defense anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| so don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| And I lose the lawsuit because my own lawyer, who's – that's how convolutedly crazy that is in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| That being separate from this mayoral council in general, my opinion, that's what I put on public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| is we should probably – this thing has been a disaster since I've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| It is – it's probably one of the worst things we've had to deal with, and it's just such a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| I have a personal opinion that we should just make this mayoral council a subcommittee of commission at one point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7353)|
| 2:02:39| I know that's not going to happen right this second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| but that might be the best solution is to eventually just have this another subcommittee like our other subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| I have three to five commissioners appointed to it every year when we do our appointments in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| and it's dealt with that way instead of – it's been such a political disaster getting people to serve on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| and all the lawsuits that are, and then we have all these kinds of issues where we're not defendable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| and there's all these questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| If we make it a subcommittee, it makes it a lot more clear-cut and at least a lot more easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| The people that we'll be serving on are already been elected by the people that serve in the best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| That might be a best solution going forward, but besides that, that's all I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7395)|
| 2:03:23| Mr. Buster, did you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| The way it was explained to me, Mr. Board, and like I said, I'm not a lawyer, so bear with me here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| but this had been going on before David Boock or Law Director Boock was elected to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| When this came up, he went back and researched all of this, but in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| the Merit Council wanted to sue the law director because he was not going on with this litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7426)|
| 2:03:55| because he felt there was something wrong with the act itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| He found out what that was, and he wanted to correct it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| but since they're part of the county, the Merit Board, people come up here to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7443)|
| 2:04:10| can we get a lawyer, and the only one that can supply a lawyer for those different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| is under the charter by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| He is the one that hires lawyers for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| So they wanted to have that lawyer, and they're spending more taxpayers' dollars for doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7462)|
| 2:04:29| and so if a department comes to this body and says it wants a lawyer for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7469)|
| 2:04:37| I think the only one that can hire a lawyer for those departments is the law director, not even this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7477)|
| 2:04:43| We can, as a body, can hire a lawyer without going through the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| but no one else can in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| I understand that. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| So there's where you get the convoluted things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| When they come and ask for a lawyer, you can tell them they don't need it because we'll take care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| and they won't listen to you because it becomes passionate and becomes political,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| and so what we're doing now is we're sitting up here talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| and we're wasting taxpayers' dollars every day that we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| We ought to do something when it comes back and take care of it as soon as we can so this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| So that's the way I understand it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| My understanding is the policies and procedures are by the Merit Council Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| So how is that different from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| Just the way that it's set out is there are differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| There's actually more power for the Merit System Council under state law than there is under the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| So the way to really solve this is for you to get together with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| work out a—adopt a setting for Merit Council, and it's done, like we wanted to do back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7554)|
| 2:06:01| It's all set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| So it seems like it's simple to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Why don't we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| I will be glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| Just—we know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| Let's just go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| Commissioner Hill, before we go back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| If we were to take this action, really addressed to both of the attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| what does that do to the actions that the Council had taken prior to the time we adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7591)|
| 2:06:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| I think the same, like, de facto argument that you had in the prior case involving Black Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| would apply to those types of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| And I don't think that we would necessarily get a ruling from the court one way or another in the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| I would suggest that it should just be dismissed and dropped so that there's not a final decision on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| And then, you know, you just take the position that whether the ordinance was legitimate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| de facto those hearings were done by a de facto board and that the results remain in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| just like they did for County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| Do you agree, Mr. Moyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| It would be a similar concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| So I don't think that it would upset the entire apple cart because of that de facto argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7637)|
| 2:07:24| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| Okay, I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| Don't play one on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| So someone tried to explain this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| If we go back and we adopt the 1974 Merit Council Act, everything magically goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7659)|
| 2:07:46| or just this one single lawsuit about does the Merit Council actually exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| It will have nothing to do with the plaintiff's lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| Well, what I would envision, and we'd have to negotiate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| would be that County Commission would repeal the prior ordinance and adopt the new act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7679)|
| 2:08:06| I don't know which would go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| One of those would happen at the same meeting as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| And then the lawsuit would just be dismissed, like I said, prior to there being any ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| It could just be, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| But that's the singular lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| That's the singular lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| It only deals with the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| But it won't do anything for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| Can you correct me if I'm wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| One of the lawsuits is does the Merit Council, can this be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| Is that being filed because the Merit Council doesn't exist or because the Merit Council rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7710)|
| 2:08:37| It's being done because there has been a question raised in a lawsuit about whether or not it is properly constituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| So the Merit Council just decided, in order to be conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| that they wanted to stop having hearings until that issue was determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| Just because in case it turns out that after this came to their attention, they still continued to have hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| maybe that would be a problem with the whole de facto argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| How many lawsuits are there here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| There's this one lawsuit about whether Merit Council exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| No, there is a lawsuit about whether or not it could be heard according to did they follow their own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7746)|
| 2:09:15| Right, and that's been ruled on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| I can't keep track of all the lawsuits these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| Yeah, there is a lawsuit with Ms. Dooley, and it is proceeding, and then there's the Cole lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| I thought Chancellor Haggerty said that could move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7766)|
| 2:09:32| I have a supplemental question to Commissioner Smith, if I can jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| That's a supplemental question? I'm still looking for my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| Okay, I believe that now that I think about it, I still help the Merit Central Council with Dooley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| but I believe it actually was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| It's just subject to being brought back up after the proper processes are followed, and I would be representing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| So really the only lawsuit that would effectively adopt this is the lawsuit on whether the Merit Council is de facto or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7792)|
| 2:10:01| Yes, and there was, like I said, a fellow named Cole who was involved in that lawsuit initially who's been dropped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| so we'd have to look at how the whole thing would impact his case because his case was heard under the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| So we'd have to figure out how his particular situation would be dealt with in a compromise like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7812)|
| 2:10:18| That's good enough for me, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| Thank you. I'm going to add some more mud to the clarity factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| If there's a current lawsuit that is before Hagerty that is all about is this – does this exist in real form or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7825)|
| 2:10:42| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| Let's say he says it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7844)|
| 2:10:47| It isn't existing legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| Let's say the ruling comes out and goes this was never done right from the beginning, this is a nonexistent thing, and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7851)|
| 2:10:58| Does that mean that all of the current pending grievances then go away because those would all be grievances against something that doesn't exist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7858)|
| 2:11:08| Potentially that would be what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| Let's say this body decided to – having not fully read it, we're talking about a hypothetical 1974 structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7871)|
| 2:11:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| Let's say this body had said on Monday of next week we want to adopt the 1974 and we deem all other ordinances having anything to do with this world, adios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7881)|
| 2:11:32| Would all current pending grievances then go away and we would start all over with a brand new slate, brand new officers, brand new structure, brand new staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7892)|
| 2:11:43| We would literally reconstitute this from zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| You could appoint the same people that you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| We could, but we could also not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| You could also not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| We could say we want to take the 1974 agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| We want to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| Thank you very much, staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| We will get back to you if we require your services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| Thank you very much, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| We'll get back to you if we want to reappoint you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| We're going to start back at zero and we're going to go this is what we want or this is what we're going to adopt as our noxicality protections for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7924)|
| 2:12:14| Yes, you would start over with the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| Now, what happens with pending cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| We would have to, again, look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| That is the biggest question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| We have currently three grievances, I think, that are in permahold, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| We have three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Three that are sitting in la-la land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| I believe a lot more than politics than legal structure, but those have to – those are real cases from real officers that are sitting in this sort of middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7952)|
| 2:12:45| So I would like – I would formally like to request a copy or – because I looked up 88401 and it has about a two-word description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7965)|
| 2:12:54| I would like to see the 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| And I would also like to see the – have the resolution that Director Book sent us in December re-sent to us for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7978)|
| 2:13:05| Sure, and it's 401 through 419 of that TCA code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| The 401 is just like the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| I just couldn't find it with a quick –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| But if I could get – whoever wants to give me those two things, I'd like to see the resolution and then the 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7992)|
| 2:13:18| And then, Mr. Moyers, I would like to ask the question of our lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| If we did adopt that, what would be the procedures for the Merit Council board members, the grievances that are pending, and the staff that currently works for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8004)|
| 2:13:37| I agree with Ms. Davis that it would – the commission would have to appoint members of this committee and the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8017)|
| 2:13:46| Now, my understanding is what we want is for basically everything to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8026)|
| 2:13:53| We just don't want the Merit Council to be able – I guess subject to collateral attack based on this question of whether or not it was properly constituted in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8033)|
| 2:14:05| Well, I'm not sure this body wants to have it be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8045)|
| 2:14:12| This council and the structure and the way it's set up, we've had multiple discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| This all happened, I think, before everyone was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| It was put in place well before all of our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| We've had discussions – last year we had a budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| Who authorizes payment and raises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| Who oversees the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Who determines the rules of the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| We know how the appointment process – I mean there's layers upon layers upon layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| We're just – all of us have sort of looked at each other and said, who's responsible for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| We've talked about do the staff nest under the mayor's office, and that was talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| We've talked about do the council – of course we had some ordinances that I proposed that – some that didn't fail about expanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| I'm not sure we want everything to be exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| I think in general this body has constantly expressed a commitment that we want a fair process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8099)|
| 2:15:08| in which our officers have a process in which to file grievances according to a certain set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8108)|
| 2:15:15| But I think that – I feel like there's a lot of ideas of how we can make it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| because ultimately we want a system that protects our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| We want a system that's fair, open, transparent, and is without question without politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8124)|
| 2:15:31| That's how it all started 50 years ago, and I'm not sure we're there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| But that's just a commentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| I think we've got a long way to go to get there, but in the short term I'd just like to review kind of whatever options on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8137)|
| 2:15:43| We'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| And a site map might be helpful as well of what lawsuits are who and who represents who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| A general like who's in the game, that might be helpful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8149)|
| 2:15:55| Mr. Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| Ms. Davis, so at the present time it is your recommendation that this body should consider adopting then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8158)|
| 2:16:07| the County Sheriff's Civil Service Law of 1974?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| But it has to be done by a two-thirds majority, so we just needed to make sure that it had that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| The one big thing that I think when you all were talking came back into my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| by doing what we're supposed to be doing, you do have to do away with the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8186)|
| 2:16:32| but you can reappoint it just like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| And that was the big scary part of this for the protection of the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8194)|
| 2:16:40| So we can't guarantee how everybody else is going to vote on here if it goes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8200)|
| 2:16:48| So that's the scary part for the merit council and the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| There's no guarantees that it would revert to the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| And there's 11 of us, and sometimes we can't even agree on what we want to eat for lunch at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| or when we have those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| But what we've got to do is assure the merit council, the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8226)|
| 2:17:14| the sheriff's employees that we want to protect them and we're going to do what's right to protect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8234)|
| 2:17:20| and to give them, and this will give them more power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| Would this not give the merit board a little bit more power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| My understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| So it would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| And how are you going to assure them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| I don't know until we step into it, take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| and put the merit council back out what they're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| And I hope we do the right thing from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| But that's what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| We've got the merit board that can be sued either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| And, again, we're still spending taxpayers' dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| by not acting on this as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| If we adopt a 1974 sheriff's merit council, civil service, put an acronym on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8284)|
| 2:18:17| does it have a specific set of rules that we could not variate from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8297)|
| 2:18:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| It's not a situation where you can be all creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| You can be much more creative with an ordinance than you can with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| So as Commissioner Jay is saying, we would have to follow that state statute as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| Yes, and you would have much more structure than what you have under an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| As to the grievances that are currently in the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| I would imagine they would have to go away and be refiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| That's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| Is there any liability for the county for due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| and making someone go through this for this long and then saying, hey, you've got to start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| I'm not aware of any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| I may muddy the water, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| It seems like there was a ‑‑ and, again, I noticed Ms. Oyster is sitting back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8362)|
| 2:19:34| and she may need to address this, that there was a document going around that stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8374)|
| 2:19:44| contrary to if we adopted the 74 ruling, that they would have more power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8384)|
| 2:19:52| when, in fact, the statement was that that is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8392)|
| 2:19:59| In fact, they would have less power and less ability to protect our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8399)|
| 2:20:07| Did anyone else see this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Am I the only one that saw this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| Was something like that put out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Gina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8417)|
| 2:20:28| She said it wasn't by the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| So the one put out by the law director's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| Are you talking about the statement that was made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| Do you mind coming to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| Do I need to state my name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| Gina Oyster, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Are you talking about the statement that was made by the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| There was a few statements going around, I think, by the law department, the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| What I recall hearing is that if we were to adopt the 74 ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8462)|
| 2:21:09| that that, in fact, which the sheriff's department maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8469)|
| 2:21:15| would actually give us more, I mean, give the board more authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8475)|
| 2:21:21| And it was because there's so much mistrust going on, it was believed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8481)|
| 2:21:29| and I thought that came from the merit board, that that, in fact, was not true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| that there were specific items that would be lost to the merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8495)|
| 2:21:42| that they currently now are able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| I think that there's a lot of misunderstanding about the whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| There are more powers that are given in some aspects of the 1974| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| than what we have currently right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| There could be some other things, which I think Ms. Davis is going to be able to give to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8520)|
| 2:22:05| maybe next week, if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| So I think that's kind of where we are, trying to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| I don't think, and I think Paula said, we didn't send anything from the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| We really just tried to go through Ms. Davis and just tried to figure out where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8537)|
| 2:22:22| and that's why I made the decision last week as the board that we just stop all hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8542)|
| 2:22:28| and stop everything right now because we're in this limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| And with lawsuits being filed at us at rapid pace, it's kind of hard to know what to do and what not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8552)|
| 2:22:43| And so Ms. Davis gave us legal counsel, and it's probably better to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| and just sit tight right now until we can figure out what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| But I do know that 1974 is going to give us a little bit more power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| It may possibly give the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| Maybe it's interpretation, and I think law is a little bit of interpretation of everything, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8577)|
| 2:23:02| But that's kind of where we are, so we're really just seeking our legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| and trying to just figure out what's best for merit right now and what's best for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8586)|
| 2:23:14| And who is the plaintiff in this lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| The sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| So the sheriff could also drop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8599)|
| 2:23:26| The sheriff could also drop the lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| I mean, what we are is we're just sitting here in the middle of a power struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| If the commission adopted the 1974 law, this lawsuit would be moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8614)|
| 2:23:41| I would love for everybody to drop it because I've never had my name in the courts before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8621)|
| 2:23:46| and it's all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| So, yeah, you can Google me and find it all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| So I'm happy with dropping the lawsuits altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| I think what you're going to find if you compare the two, the 1974 and the ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| there's going to be some give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| So there will be some more powers on one hand and then some given away on another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| So I don't think it's necessarily a situation where it's just more power or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| There's going to be more power in some areas and taken away in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| Commissioners, I hate to say this, but we have two more discussion items on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8652)|
| 2:24:18| and we have other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| And at the moment, I am the only chair or vice chair on this dais.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| And if we don't take a break, we're going to have a bigger problem than what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| So let's take a quick break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| We'll reconvene at around 730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8669)|
| 2:24:35| Call this work session back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| We are still on discussion item 46 regarding the lawsuits facing the Merit System Council for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8677)|
| 2:24:45| And I believe Commissioner Durrett, your light is on, and so I'm going to turn the floor over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8685)|
| 2:24:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| I just want to remind my colleagues that, you know, we have this discussion about lawsuits and grievances and all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| but it's not just about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| The Merit System, especially the staff, is what has created the hiring process as well for the sheriff's employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8702)|
| 2:25:10| and the merit-covered position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| And so we need to keep that in mind when we're talking about this and talking about if we get rid of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8713)|
| 2:25:18| and all of those things and the potential that we are essentially –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| we could potentially get rid of four livelihoods of the staff members that work for Merit System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8723)|
| 2:25:31| So we need to tread carefully as we go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| It is a very sticky situation that we have found out, but at the same time, people rely on this for their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8736)|
| 2:25:45| This is their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| We don't – I have not reviewed the 1974 Act well enough to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| and I know when it was brought before us before in December, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| there was a particular question that sticks out in my mind because I was worried about our executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8760)|
| 2:26:06| maybe being able to be demoted or even lose her position because it said –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8766)|
| 2:26:15| and I am recalling from December, so this could be incorrect phrasing –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| that the sheriff would be able to choose a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| And at the moment, the secretary is in fact the executive director, a.k.a. Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8785)|
| 2:26:32| So again, I just want to remind everyone that this, while maybe it sounds simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| I don't think it's as simple as we want it to be when we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| Thank you, Ms. Davis, for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| And I've just been informed by Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| I don't want to misrepresent anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| He believes that it was not Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| If you don't mind to just speak into the microphone and have the last word, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| Mr. Moyers was just informing me that he believes that, according to David Buke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| it was the county that intervened and not County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| My understanding was it was supposed to be County Commission because that was who was going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8829)|
| 2:27:14| you know, stand up for its ordinance potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| But if I'm wrong about that and it's the county, then that was a misunderstanding on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| That's what David just told me on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| I haven't seen the filing, so I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| So if it were the county, then I apologize for telling you it was the commission because that was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8845)|
| 2:27:33| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8853)|
| 2:27:34| I didn't want to tell you wrong information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| Commissioner Durrett, did you have a question for Ms. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| Just more of a request, and I think everybody would want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| Would you do us a favor and do a comparison between the 1974 Act and the current merit system as it is right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8862)|
| 2:27:50| so we can see the similarities and the differences if we were to, in fact, pass the 1974 Act state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8870)|
| 2:27:58| I would be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| Madam Clerk, would you please read the next – I'm sorry, Commissioner Ward, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| Commissioner Jay, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| While I also want to see the comparison, I don't think we can direct Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| She doesn't work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| She works for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8898)|
| 2:28:19| I don't think we can give her instructions and decide to spend her time and the taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8899)|
| 2:28:25| She's not at our direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| So while I would like that, I'm not sure we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| I mean, I didn't take it as a directive, but Ms. Davis, would you like to respond to that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8913)|
| 2:28:38| Mr. Moyers, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| I mean, I just don't want to circumvent this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| This council does not work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8923)|
| 2:28:47| Okay, here's the way this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| Once we hire Ms. Davis, Ms. Davis is out of – we do not supervise her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| She works for the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| So she is not under anybody's direction but theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| But I would be glad to, in representing my client, provide that to you because I feel like it's in their best interest for you to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| so that you have the information necessary to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| So I see that within the scope of my representation to provide that information to try to get this matter resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| And then I'll be glad to share that with the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| If they differ, they can let you know with my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| Commissioner Ward, did you have a question for Ms. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| I'm sorry to keep running back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| I have a question that I promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8966)|
| 2:29:31| We in court have already said that we don't believe in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| If we don't accept this, are we just without anything at that point to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| It just makes it difficult for me to come in and defend an ordinance when the body that passed the ordinance says it's no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8980)|
| 2:29:48| And or the county that has the commission says it's no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8988)|
| 2:29:52| It's pretty much the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| It just it makes it much harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| Not impossible, but much harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=8995)|
| 2:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| Thank you again, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9001)|

| 2:30:14| Commissioner Daly, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| Yes, it's my pleasure, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| We have a new director at the KKB who's calling, and she's come from Beardsley Farm, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9018)|
| 2:30:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| My background is environmental education, so I spent 12 years at Beardsley Farm as a farm manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9029)|
| 2:30:38| and then as urban agriculture director, and then I left Beardsley to work at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9038)|
| 2:30:45| recycling and managing its waste and doing zero-waste football games and all that trashy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9045)|
| 2:30:53| So, yes, I feel like this new role is a perfect fit for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9053)|
| 2:31:01| It's very natural grounds for me to be in, working with volunteers and working with nonprofits and government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9061)|
| 2:31:12| both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| It's really exciting work for me, so I'm really happy to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| Are all of you familiar with Keep Knoxville Beautiful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9080)|
| 2:31:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| So, yeah, we've been here since 1978, came about because we were deemed the scruffy city by the Wall Street Journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9086)|
| 2:31:34| So before the World's Fair Park began, the World's Fair began, a group of people decided to beautify Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9094)|
| 2:31:43| and eventually that group became Keep Knoxville Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| So we've grown a lot over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| In its 43 years, we're known for our three pillars, clean, green, and beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9111)|
| 2:31:57| so really known for our litter eradication practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| We're an affiliate of Keep America Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| There's greening, there's our plantings and environmental education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| and then there's beautiful public art and murals and placemaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| So just an example of some of our successes is we're doing the Great American Cleanup right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| So this Saturday, April 23rd, we've got 438 people signed up to clean up South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9140)|
| 2:32:29| It's a pretty impressive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| Last year, we removed 6,000 pounds of trash, and I don't know if litter and trash, if you all see it as much as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9152)|
| 2:32:40| but it's everywhere, and it's about to get mowed and chopped down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| so we won't be thinking about it as much, but it's there, and it doesn't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9164)|
| 2:32:50| It really has become part of our landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| Whether you see it or whether you don't see it, it's in everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9173)|
| 2:32:59| It's in sea salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| It's in our fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| It's just really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| So I'm really passionate about this issue and just excited to do work with our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220418?start=9186)|
