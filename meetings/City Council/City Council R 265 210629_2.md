| 3:45:43| in that particular regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13543)|
| 3:45:46| And I do ask because previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13546)|
| 3:45:49| or I guess a few years ago, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13549)|
| 3:45:54| but these were poles that previously the city managed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13554)|
| 3:45:57| and now are being transferred, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| That's actually referring to the Streetlight Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13561)|
| 3:46:02| which you all have taken over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| That was part of that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13564)|
| 3:46:05| but that's not the case now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13565)|
| 3:46:06| And I want to be clear, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13566)|
| 3:46:07| as far as the reason we haven't formed out that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| We've worked with our local peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| here at Comcast and Theory every day in our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13571)|
| 3:46:14| and I'm not casting blame one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13574)|
| 3:46:17| Mr. Mackey and Mr. Bolles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13577)|
| 3:46:18| have both had conversations recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13578)|
| 3:46:20| and both have committed to come back to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13580)|
| 3:46:22| So we look forward to that process and dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13582)|
| 3:46:26| The pandemic threw a lot of things off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| and Waver will just blame it on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| but if indeed you want to be back to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13590)|
| 3:46:31| with Comcast on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| Just a little poll 101, and Mr. Bolles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| you may jump in, or one of your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13595)|
| 3:46:36| So there are poles owned by KB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13596)|
| 3:46:39| there are poles owned by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13599)|
| 3:46:40| there are poles owned by Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13600)|
| 3:46:42| Actually, I don't mean-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13602)|
| 3:46:43| Poles owned by AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13603)|
| 3:46:43| Comcast does not own any poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13603)|
| 3:46:44| AT&T owns them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13604)|
| 3:46:45| AT&T, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13605)|
| 3:46:46| So access to the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13606)|
| 3:46:48| has lots of federal control, state control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13608)|
| 3:46:52| How you attach the poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13612)|
| 3:46:54| that is the individual owner of the pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13614)|
| 3:46:56| negotiated with people attaching to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13616)|
| 3:46:59| including the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13619)|
| 3:46:59| We've had our own discussions about attaching to KB poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13619)|
| 3:47:03| There is a desire to minimize the number of poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13623)|
| 3:47:06| that we have oftentimes in our right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13626)|
| 3:47:08| cluttered in our right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13628)|
| 3:47:09| but there are poles owned by multiple people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13629)|
| 3:47:12| within our right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13632)|
| 3:47:13| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13633)|
| 3:47:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13636)|
| 3:47:17| Those are all my questions on this call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13639)|
| 3:47:22| By the way, I was just standing up to stretch my back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13642)|
| 3:47:25| I didn't mean anything by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13645)|
| 3:47:26| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13646)|
| 3:47:29| Yeah, so my colleagues have asked a lot of great questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13649)|
| 3:47:32| so I get to take some off my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13652)|
| 3:47:34| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13654)|
| 3:47:36| Mr. Mackey, I have a question for you real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13656)|
| 3:47:40| You're talking about the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13660)|
| 3:47:41| that you guys are working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| and I wanna, well, I'm gonna ask you a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13663)|
| 3:47:46| then I'm gonna make a comment about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13666)|
| 3:47:48| Are you proposing symmetrical with this expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13668)|
| 3:47:51| or asymmetrical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13671)|
| 3:47:52| We are proposing a fiber build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13672)|
| 3:47:56| and that is certainly capable of symmetrical speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| So what people currently have in their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| some of the business owners that are commenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13682)|
| 3:48:05| about not having symmetrical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13685)|
| 3:48:07| is that because it's just not available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| Because the build-out that you have in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| doesn't allow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13691)|
| 3:48:12| So I think there's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13692)|
| 3:48:14| a little more clarification required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13694)|
| 3:48:16| So first, from a business standpoint in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13696)|
| 3:48:19| we offer up to 100 gigabit per second symmetrical speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13699)|
| 3:48:26| We also have a two gig symmetrical product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13706)|
| 3:48:29| that is available in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13709)|
| 3:48:33| Most of our customers are served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| over a cable modem-based network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13715)|
| 3:48:39| and that service, which Mr. Bowles referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13719)|
| 3:48:43| is 1.25 gigs downstream, 35 megs upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13723)|
| 3:48:49| So it impacts people's upload speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13729)|
| 3:48:51| So like what Mr. Roy was speaking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13731)|
| 3:48:54| his business requires him to upload large files,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13734)|
| 3:48:57| and it's faster for him to drive across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13737)|
| 3:49:01| Well, I would say that certainly from an upstream standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13741)|
| 3:49:05| if you look at independent sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13745)|
| 3:49:08| you could have 16 simultaneous Zoom calls within a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13748)|
| 3:49:14| and still be able to facilitate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13754)|
| 3:49:19| without any interruptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| Zoom calls, but not necessarily uploads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| It depends on what it is you're uploading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13763)|
| 3:49:26| If you're uploading a 4K movie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13766)|
| 3:49:29| there might be a little bit of a delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13769)|
| 3:49:30| but outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13770)|
| 3:49:32| Digital files, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13772)|
| 3:49:36| I'm not trying to be rude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13776)|
| 3:49:37| or hanging out the dryer or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13777)|
| 3:49:38| It's just one of the things as council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13778)|
| 3:49:40| that we talk about when we run for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13780)|
| 3:49:43| to serve our communities, to support businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13783)|
| 3:49:46| and that impacts jobs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13786)|
| 3:49:48| And I'm looking at, this is out on the internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13788)|
| 3:49:52| and I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13792)|
| 3:49:53| because a lot of people don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13794)|
| 3:49:59| One of the broadband providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13799)|
| 3:50:02| not Comcast or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13802)|
| 3:50:04| describes symmetrical and talks about why you would need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13804)|
| 3:50:07| It says if you're in the cloud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| which many of us do things in the cloud these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| instead of save to our local hard drives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13811)|
| 3:50:14| or have a lot of VPN users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13814)|
| 3:50:15| or demand consistent reliability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| a symmetrical connection may be a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13817)|
| 3:50:21| If you need reliable 99% plus connection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13821)|
| 3:50:25| which many of us needed that in this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| and the pandemic, whether it be for school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13828)|
| 3:50:30| or for being on a Zoom meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13830)|
| 3:50:35| or multiple Zoom meetings, that was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| since we're talking about building out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13839)|
| 3:50:41| I will say one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| If I could add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| that we, with regard to symmetrical speeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13845)|
| 3:50:48| and I mentioned that the network is continuing to evolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13848)|
| 3:50:51| and we're continuing investing in new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13851)|
| 3:50:54| And we actually are currently testing in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13854)|
| 3:50:58| symmetrical gig speeds in markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13858)|
| 3:51:01| and anticipate that we will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13861)|
| 3:51:06| to offer that via cable modem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13866)|
| 3:51:09| certainly inside of KUV's build out plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13869)|
| 3:51:12| Okay, and pardon me for being ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13872)|
| 3:51:15| So a service model is like in my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| I have Comcast and I have a cable modem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13877)|
| 3:51:20| and we have one gig service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13880)|
| 3:51:21| because my husband views a lot of videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13881)|
| 3:51:24| and has to do his work 24, not 24, seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13884)|
| 3:51:27| seven days a week till midnight many days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13887)|
| 3:51:31| by watching video and transcribing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| and making notes on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| Um, I lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13895)|
| 3:51:39| So what you're saying is the difference is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13899)|
| 3:51:42| the technology is like fiber directly to the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13902)|
| 3:51:45| versus coming in through a cable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13905)|
| 3:51:48| and plugging into them, coming out of a modem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13908)|
| 3:51:52| I think there are different delivery mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| and we offer multiple delivery mechanisms in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13915)|
| 3:52:00| and it's somewhat a function of price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13920)|
| 3:52:02| and evolution of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13922)|
| 3:52:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13925)|
| 3:52:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13927)|
| 3:52:07| Okay, the only other thing I, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13927)|
| 3:52:10| I wanted to also comment when I met with Mr. Andres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13930)|
| 3:52:13| I don't have any more questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13933)|
| 3:52:14| I just wanted to clarify the build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| that you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13936)|
| 3:52:17| When I met with Mr. Andres and I really appreciate his time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13937)|
| 3:52:21| I asked if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13941)|
| 3:52:22| will you guys still do what you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13942)|
| 3:52:26| And the answer was yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13946)|
| 3:52:28| if for certain things and funding with other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13948)|
| 3:52:32| municipalities and funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13952)|
| 3:52:35| So I think one thing to note is there's a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13955)|
| 3:52:38| of still being a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13958)|
| 3:52:41| Like we go back to Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13961)|
| 3:52:44| you know, did broadband in 2010, I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13964)|
| 3:52:47| and Comcast is in that market, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13967)|
| 3:52:50| So these things still exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13970)|
| 3:52:52| and still are competitors with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| So I think that's important to note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13974)|
| 3:52:57| that it's still a possibility and it's still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13977)|
| 3:53:02| It's important to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13982)|
| 3:53:03| the discussions that we've heard from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13983)|
| 3:53:06| not only by email, but who came here and spoke tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13986)|
| 3:53:10| to talk about how to support the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13990)|
| 3:53:12| And it's not just the businesses that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13992)|
| 3:53:15| it's also the businesses that we've lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13995)|
| 3:53:17| to other markets like Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=13997)|
| 3:53:20| Sometimes businesses coming here are to support businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14000)|
| 3:53:23| that are already here and be complimentary to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14003)|
| 3:53:25| This is very important for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| or whether it be, I believe Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14007)|
| 3:53:30| the mayor from Union County, maybe if I have that correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14010)|
| 3:53:33| the same thing for them to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| to meet those rural markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| I grew up in a rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| and we didn't have access to cable TV, which was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14019)|
| 3:53:44| My dad still doesn't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| And I couldn't force him for me to give it to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| with an iPad during the pandemic, he didn't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14029)|
| 3:53:52| But it wasn't an option and it was just rabbit ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14032)|
| 3:53:56| And so I understand what that's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14036)|
| 3:53:58| to not have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14038)|
| 3:54:00| At that time, school wasn't available through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14040)|
| 3:54:03| you know, it wasn't an impact for me, but it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14043)|
| 3:54:06| Another example that I got was that my husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14046)|
| 3:54:10| was sharing with me how the speeds available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14050)|
| 3:54:14| to their office, which is very close to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14054)|
| 3:54:17| they actually can't, from their equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| download the videos for patient monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14059)|
| 3:54:23| So this impacts healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14063)|
| 3:54:26| And so they actually have to go to the individual machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14066)|
| 3:54:30| So if you imagine when you go to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14070)|
| 3:54:31| many of us have probably had an MRI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14071)|
| 3:54:34| When you go through the MRI machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14074)|
| 3:54:36| it's uploaded and it goes off to another room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| somewhere in the hospital and the radiologist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| is over there reading that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14080)|
| 3:54:43| You would think it would be quite weird| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14083)|
| 3:54:44| if you go through the MRI machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| they load, you know, five patients before lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14086)|
| 3:54:47| or something and have their scans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14087)|
| 3:54:49| And then afternoon, the radiologist has to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14089)|
| 3:54:52| and read it locally at the machine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14092)|
| 3:54:54| because there isn't the ability to upload that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14094)|
| 3:54:56| That slows down patient care and makes it less reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14096)|
| 3:55:01| So this does impact us all in many different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14101)|
| 3:55:04| whether it's a business that serves us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14104)|
| 3:55:06| a business that might come to town and provide jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| and increase wages, or if it's service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14108)|
| 3:55:12| for your own healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14112)|
| 3:55:15| I understand and I am very concerned about the rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14115)|
| 3:55:18| and I want to continue that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14118)|
| 3:55:20| I think it's really important to make it clear to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14120)|
| 3:55:22| that the rate difference is just that $3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14122)|
| 3:55:26| and something that is tied to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14126)|
| 3:55:30| But the, sorry, it's getting late, folks, I'm retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14130)|
| 3:55:35| For the folks who feel that this doesn't impact them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14135)|
| 3:55:38| because they don't want broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14138)|
| 3:55:39| or they don't want internet, it does because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| for example, I work at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| The nurses and the students that we're training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14143)|
| 3:55:46| whether it's nursing or welding or English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14146)|
| 3:55:50| they have to have internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14150)|
| 3:55:51| My students come into my library and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14151)|
| 3:55:55| at the beginning of the semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14155)|
| 3:55:56| they'll come in because they've enrolled for school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| and then they find out when they get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| that in order to stay in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14160)|
| 3:56:02| they have to have internet or reliable internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14162)|
| 3:56:05| and they don't have it for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| And I did reach out to Pellissippi today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14167)|
| 3:56:09| to ask if we've surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14169)|
| 3:56:11| what are the barriers keeping them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14171)|
| 3:56:12| And the person that might have that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14172)|
| 3:56:14| is on vacation this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14174)|
| 3:56:15| so I don't know why they don't have internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| if it's a price point thing or if it's an access issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14177)|
| 3:56:21| So for example, the folks that spoke here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| and talked about not being able to get access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14183)|
| 3:56:25| they could not be a student at Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14185)|
| 3:56:27| or UT or other places and say, get a nursing degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14187)|
| 3:56:30| and then turn around and offer care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14190)|
| 3:56:31| to people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14191)|
| 3:56:34| We have shortages of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14194)|
| 3:56:36| who work in the healthcare community, so we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14196)|
| 3:56:39| So this supports people getting an education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| whether it's K through 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14201)|
| 3:56:42| or it's people that are getting higher education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14202)|
| 3:56:45| or they're gonna turn around and take care of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| no matter what our age is or what our health issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14207)|
| 3:56:50| And I think that's super important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14210)|
| 3:56:51| It's very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| And it's something that we talk about daily in my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14213)|
| 3:56:57| because my husband's in the healthcare industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14217)|
| 3:56:59| So we've got to be able to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14219)|
| 3:57:02| and we've got to be able to support businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14222)|
| 3:57:04| to keep them here and bring them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14224)|
| 3:57:06| And so I understand that this is a competitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14226)|
| 3:57:11| but I'm just gonna say those are reasons that I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14231)|
| 3:57:13| I certainly can't go back and look my students in the eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14233)|
| 3:57:16| and say, I had the opportunity to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14236)|
| 3:57:18| but I chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14238)|
| 3:57:20| And I'm sorry you're dropping out of school now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14240)|
| 3:57:22| And the last thing I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14242)|
| 3:57:23| and then I'll be quiet and pass the torch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14243)|
| 3:57:25| is I have my wrong notes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14245)|
| 3:57:27| You know, one of the arguments is about local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14247)|
| 3:57:31| and utilities shouldn't be into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14251)|
| 3:57:36| We're looking at it, for us to be healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14256)|
| 3:57:38| for us to have educations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14258)|
| 3:57:40| we need to have not a market failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14260)|
| 3:57:42| but we need all of the markets to be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14262)|
| 3:57:45| And there are people that aren't being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14265)|
| 3:57:47| And of course, we all got binders with all the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| for people that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14270)|
| 3:57:51| piles and piles of people who support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14271)|
| 3:57:54| And this was really interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14274)|
| 3:57:55| because if this person's not literally in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14275)|
| 3:57:57| they're certainly quite close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14277)|
| 3:57:59| There was somebody who, one of their emails was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14279)|
| 3:58:02| that they live on one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14282)|
| 3:58:04| they live basically off Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14284)|
| 3:58:06| They said on one side lies Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14286)|
| 3:58:08| the other side, Beverly Road, both places in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14288)|
| 3:58:12| Both are 3,500 feet from my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14292)|
| 3:58:14| and both are eligible for gigabyte fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14294)|
| 3:58:16| courtesy of Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14296)|
| 3:58:18| My house, zero access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14298)|
| 3:58:21| Comcast never ran a lounge down my road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| and after almost 15 years of asking and pleading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14303)|
| 3:58:26| I do not think they ever will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14306)|
| 3:58:28| I've emailed countless times, talked to many representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14308)|
| 3:58:31| and I regularly get flyers from Comcast saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14311)|
| 3:58:34| to call in and switch service to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14314)|
| 3:58:37| They were quoted $15,000 to run a line to their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14317)|
| 3:58:40| on a business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14320)|
| 3:58:42| And then they would have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14322)|
| 3:58:44| they would be able to pay for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| to use that line after they paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14326)|
| 3:58:50| They have no other landline options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14330)|
| 3:58:53| There's, I guess, some DSL but AT&T is no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14333)|
| 3:58:56| hooking people up for new service to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14336)|
| 3:58:58| and AT&T is not an option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| So this is someone who just doesn't have an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14340)|
| 3:59:03| and they literally live right there in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14343)|
| 3:59:06| And so for these many reasons, I have to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14346)|
| 3:59:09| I would call for the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14349)|
| 3:59:10| but I have colleagues that wanna speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14350)|
| 3:59:12| so I'm not gonna do that to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14352)|
| 3:59:13| and I'm gonna be quiet now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14353)|
| 3:59:15| Before I go to the next speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14355)|
| 3:59:17| I just wanted to, Council Member Ryder mentioned healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14357)|
| 3:59:21| and we haven't had a recess in over two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14361)|
| 3:59:24| I wanna be sensitive to our health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14364)|
| 3:59:27| If Council wishes to take a brief recess, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14367)|
| 3:59:31| We can do that and we can invite the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14371)|
| 3:59:33| to make sure we don't speak about the agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14373)|
| 3:59:36| or we can just plow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14376)|
| 3:59:38| Mayor, let's take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14378)|
| 3:59:39| Okay, let's take, how about five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| Five minutes, members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14382)|
| 3:59:44| if you wanna monitor our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14384)|
| 3:59:45| and make sure we're not talking about anything, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14385)|
| 3:59:48| We'll reconvene now, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14388)|
| 3:59:54| Councilman Roberto, I think your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14394)|
| 3:59:59| I mean, if you wanna take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14399)|
| 4:00:01| No, it's back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14401)|
| 4:00:02| Okay, back on and then we'll go to Council Member Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14402)|
| 4:00:06| and then Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14406)|
| 4:00:07| Thank you, Mayor and thank you for the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14407)|
| 4:00:09| I think that was helpful for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14409)|
| 4:00:11| But I also wanted to thank you for bringing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| to Council today and I wanna thank your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14413)|
| 4:00:15| for working on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14415)|
| 4:00:17| I just wanna say that I'm not against this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14417)|
| 4:00:21| I'm actually far from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| This is something I would actually expect to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14423)|
| 4:00:26| My hesitation here centers around the timeframe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14426)|
| 4:00:30| that Council has had to notify and engage our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14430)|
| 4:00:34| in the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| KUB did their process and they did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14436)|
| 4:00:41| I think this is a good plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14441)|
| 4:00:44| and a good plan can stand up to notice and public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14444)|
| 4:00:51| Council doesn't set the schedule for agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14451)|
| 4:00:54| However, as I detailed out earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14454)|
| 4:00:56| there's a path to have written notice and a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14456)|
| 4:01:02| and accomplish all that by August the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14462)|
| 4:01:06| Again, I'm not opposed to this project at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14466)|
| 4:01:11| But I do believe we need to have notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14471)|
| 4:01:15| and we need to have a public workshop before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14475)|
| 4:01:20| I would ask why would we risk such an important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14480)|
| 4:01:24| when we've already had discussion from Council members today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14484)|
| 4:01:27| about having a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14487)|
| 4:01:29| Why would we risk losing votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14489)|
| 4:01:32| that we would otherwise get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14492)|
| 4:01:34| I would just emphasize a few things that we heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14494)|
| 4:01:40| It's been 12 days since KUB passed this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14500)|
| 4:01:46| There is no pot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14506)|
| 4:01:48| We're waiting on Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14508)|
| 4:01:50| There's no reason to not have public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14510)|
| 4:01:55| There's no reason to not have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14515)|
| 4:01:58| There's no reason why we can't do this in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14518)|
| 4:02:02| If it's a good idea today, which I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14522)|
| 4:02:05| it's a good idea in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14525)|
| 4:02:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14527)|
| 4:02:11| Council Member Fugate, is your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14531)|
| 4:02:14| Yes, I had one more question about the jobs issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14534)|
| 4:02:19| So I heard something about if KUB does FIBER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14539)|
| 4:02:24| it'll create about 200 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14544)|
| 4:02:28| Do we have enough people in town qualified to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14548)|
| 4:02:33| So that's one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14553)|
| 4:02:34| which then also goes into my next question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14554)|
| 4:02:39| what is a realistic, I'm trying to manage expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14559)|
| 4:02:45| what is a realistic time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14565)|
| 4:02:48| that somebody might actually see this at their house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14568)|
| 4:02:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14572)|
| 4:02:54| I think we all know the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14574)|
| 4:02:55| of the job market right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14575)|
| 4:02:56| That's not unique to whether it's FIBER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14576)|
| 4:02:57| and electric alignment or a customer support representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14577)|
| 4:03:00| Well, I was talking about trained and qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14580)|
| 4:03:03| not can you pay them and find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14583)|
| 4:03:06| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14586)|
| 4:03:08| We already have folks that have some of this skill set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14588)|
| 4:03:11| because we already have that FIBER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14591)|
| 4:03:12| we already have electronic networks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14592)|
| 4:03:13| so we've gotta get a little bit of a head start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14593)|
| 4:03:15| in that particular regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14595)|
| 4:03:17| As it relates to when we hope to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14597)|
| 4:03:19| we hope to last somebody in calendar year 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14599)|
| 4:03:23| So if we are able to get in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| effectively starting July 1, there's a lot to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14605)|
| 4:03:28| We hope sometime in 2022 to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14608)|
| 4:03:32| maybe as early as summer would be a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14612)|
| 4:03:34| But again, we've gotta get some of those detailed plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14614)|
| 4:03:37| that really are still formative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14617)|
| 4:03:38| at this particular point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14618)|
| 4:03:39| but our best estimate and goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14619)|
| 4:03:42| would be to like somebody in 2022 with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14622)|
| 4:03:45| Okay, I just, people act like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14625)|
| 4:03:47| it's gonna be at their house tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14627)|
| 4:03:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14628)|
| 4:03:49| And I just think that we've got to manage expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14629)|
| 4:03:53| that whether this passes today or a month from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14633)|
| 4:03:58| or whatever, that it's gonna take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14638)|
| 4:04:02| And to that point, I think some of the cave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14642)|
| 4:04:08| that existing providers, employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14648)|
| 4:04:13| would be very concerned that they might lose their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14653)|
| 4:04:17| if you get into this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| But what I'm hearing is you might need people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14659)|
| 4:04:22| So perhaps the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14662)|
| 4:04:26| who provide that skillset would be employable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14666)|
| 4:04:31| regardless of the providers doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14671)|
| 4:04:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14674)|
| 4:04:36| I would assume that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14676)|
| 4:04:38| You know, the same skillsets that serve in the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14678)|
| 4:04:43| are not unique to the individual entities in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14683)|
| 4:04:46| So I really can't speak to their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14686)|
| 4:04:48| because I don't know what all is served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14688)|
| 4:04:50| out of Knoxville per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14690)|
| 4:04:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14691)|
| 4:04:52| And so I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14692)|
| 4:04:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14694)|
| 4:04:54| Person to person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14694)|
| 4:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14696)|
| 4:04:57| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14697)|
| 4:05:01| Thank you, Madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14701)|
| 4:05:03| I'm tired, so to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| My concern is about the gentleman that was over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14705)|
| 4:05:10| from Business Forward was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14710)|
| 4:05:14| that so often broadband has first gone into areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14714)|
| 4:05:17| that were already being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| When I think about the third district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| there are a lot of people who are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14721)|
| 4:05:23| gig economy, selling baseball cards online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14723)|
| 4:05:27| and just trying to figure out how to make a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| and the internet assists them in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14729)|
| 4:05:33| I don't, how, so my only hesitation with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14733)|
| 4:05:37| is moving forward without knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14737)|
| 4:05:40| how we're going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14740)|
| 4:05:42| I know that, as the Vice Mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14742)|
| 4:05:44| that we have the advisory board with KUV now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14744)|
| 4:05:49| But I don't want to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14749)|
| 4:05:51| and then have people in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14751)|
| 4:05:53| that are already being served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14753)|
| 4:05:55| that that's where it goes into first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14755)|
| 4:05:57| and then everybody else that may need it more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14757)|
| 4:06:01| may not be able to afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14761)|
| 4:06:02| is just paying on something that other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14762)|
| 4:06:06| can't, that don't, that they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14766)|
| 4:06:10| Yeah, that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14770)|
| 4:06:12| How do we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14772)|
| 4:06:16| you know, and then there's the whole conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14776)|
| 4:06:18| about if, I don't remember the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14778)|
| 4:06:21| but there were like 3,000 cutoffs last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14781)|
| 4:06:27| There were a lot of cutoffs, let's go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14787)|
| 4:06:30| What's gonna happen if they can't pay their internet bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14790)|
| 4:06:35| Totally separate bill, totally separate entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14795)|
| 4:06:37| will not be connected in the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14797)|
| 4:06:39| that if you don't pay the internet bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14799)|
| 4:06:41| we just shut off your internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14801)|
| 4:06:42| Does not affect your utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14802)|
| 4:06:43| any of your utility services for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14803)|
| 4:06:45| That will be independent of those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14805)|
| 4:06:48| So if you don't pay your broadband bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14808)|
| 4:06:50| then that will be cut off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14810)|
| 4:06:52| but it's not gonna affect your electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14812)|
| 4:06:53| Yes, separate bill and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14813)|
| 4:06:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14816)|
| 4:06:57| Council Member Singh, I was gonna see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14817)|
| 4:06:59| Board Chair Jerry Askew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14819)|
| 4:07:01| looked like you wanted to speak about equity issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14821)|
| 4:07:04| I know it's really been important to the KUB board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14824)|
| 4:07:07| and when I appoint members and council confirms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| members to the KUB commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14829)|
| 4:07:12| equity is the number one thing I ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14832)|
| 4:07:14| Equity and fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14834)|
| 4:07:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14836)|
| 4:07:17| Wanna make sure everybody cares about equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14837)|
| 4:07:18| and municipal fiber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14838)|
| 4:07:19| So tell us how, if you could address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| Council Member Singh's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14841)|
| 4:07:22| about how we can assure the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14842)|
| 4:07:25| that if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| that you will be offering fiber in an equitable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14847)|
| 4:07:31| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14851)|
| 4:07:32| My name is Jerry Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14852)|
| 4:07:33| I live at 701 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14853)|
| 4:07:38| And you're chair of the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14858)|
| 4:07:39| And I'm chair of the board, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| There's no way in the world that I can convince somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14861)|
| 4:07:47| who's not going to be convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| that we are committed to an equitable path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14869)|
| 4:07:53| All I can say is that in every single conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14873)|
| 4:07:58| we've had at the board level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14878)|
| 4:08:01| we have talked about equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| At the meeting we had at the Change Center two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14883)|
| 4:08:08| I made the comment that for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14888)|
| 4:08:11| this is a head issue, surely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14891)|
| 4:08:14| because it's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14894)|
| 4:08:16| There are tough business decisions we have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14896)|
| 4:08:18| but for every single one of us, it's also a heart issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14898)|
| 4:08:22| The real reason most of us have gotten really concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14902)|
| 4:08:26| about this issue in a way that has been energized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14906)|
| 4:08:29| so much over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| is because we have seen the inequities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| that we knew existed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14913)|
| 4:08:35| but have been magnified immensely by COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14915)|
| 4:08:40| We have children who are falling further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14920)|
| 4:08:44| We've got seniors who are dependent on the internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14924)|
| 4:08:49| for their telemedicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14929)|
| 4:08:51| We have businesses that can't do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14931)|
| 4:08:55| and so they're never going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14935)|
| 4:08:57| to get past that glass ceiling of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14937)|
| 4:09:00| to get enough revenue coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14940)|
| 4:09:02| that they can really start to employ more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14942)|
| 4:09:04| I could go on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14944)|
| 4:09:07| From my own personal perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14947)|
| 4:09:09| we saw people who, in the midst of the worst pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14949)|
| 4:09:12| that we've had in 100 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14952)|
| 4:09:16| they couldn't participate in their worshiping communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14956)|
| 4:09:19| and that, for many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14959)|
| 4:09:20| that was the only source of their hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14960)|
| 4:09:22| and they were cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14962)|
| 4:09:23| And so if you talk to any one of our members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14963)|
| 4:09:27| we will tell you that it's the heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14967)|
| 4:09:29| that's driving our interest in this as much as the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14969)|
| 4:09:35| And I can also tell you that in our public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14975)|
| 4:09:40| we've made the commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14980)|
| 4:09:42| In our official public meetings at KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14982)|
| 4:09:44| we have made the commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14984)|
| 4:09:46| that one of the primary criteria in deciding where we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14986)|
| 4:09:51| is going to be where the people are least well-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14991)|
| 4:09:55| In our public open forum meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14995)|
| 4:09:58| that we had with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=14998)|
| 4:10:00| we promised, we put our names on the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15000)|
| 4:10:02| that this is going to be one of our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15002)|
| 4:10:05| What you'll likely see is a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15005)|
| 4:10:09| where all at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15009)|
| 4:10:12| there will be somebody over there and somebody over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15012)|
| 4:10:14| and somebody over there and somebody over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15014)|
| 4:10:16| getting service in the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15016)|
| 4:10:18| And then the second round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15018)|
| 4:10:19| there'll be somebody over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15019)|
| 4:10:20| and somebody over there and somebody over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15020)|
| 4:10:21| So it's not just a matter of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15021)|
| 4:10:23| we go to an underserved part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15023)|
| 4:10:27| and we do all of that there and make everybody else wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15027)|
| 4:10:31| It doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| And we can be in many places at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15033)|
| 4:10:36| but I'll give you my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15036)|
| 4:10:39| I can speak on behalf of every member of our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15039)|
| 4:10:43| that equity has been at the center of our conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15043)|
| 4:10:47| and will continue to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15047)|
| 4:10:49| And if I might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15049)|
| 4:10:52| Council Member Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15052)|
| 4:10:54| I appreciate both what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15054)|
| 4:10:57| and Council Member Puget said about workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15057)|
| 4:11:01| I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15061)|
| 4:11:03| And I appreciate that in your normal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15063)|
| 4:11:08| especially for something this big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15068)|
| 4:11:10| you would have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15070)|
| 4:11:11| But this situation is distinctive in one important way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15071)|
| 4:11:15| Our mayor has appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15075)|
| 4:11:17| and each of you has approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15077)|
| 4:11:20| every member of our commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15080)|
| 4:11:23| And you have charged us with leading the public utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15083)|
| 4:11:29| that are in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15089)|
| 4:11:32| And we have carried out that charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15092)|
| 4:11:34| We have done the due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15094)|
| 4:11:36| We have, I feel like I've been in a workshop for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15096)|
| 4:11:41| You can count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15101)|
| 4:11:42| Because of the structure that you set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15102)|
| 4:11:44| you have an advantage that is probably not true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15104)|
| 4:11:47| in the other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15107)|
| 4:11:49| the other issues for which you would have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15109)|
| 4:11:51| You have an appointed and approved group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15111)|
| 4:11:54| that you have charged with carrying out this responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15114)|
| 4:11:57| And we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15117)|
| 4:11:59| I appreciate your compliments about our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15119)|
| 4:12:00| But that, I think we can stay here all night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15120)|
| 4:12:04| to answer as many questions as you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15124)|
| 4:12:06| But we've done the workshop work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15126)|
| 4:12:08| And I think you can rest assured that it's been done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15128)|
| 4:12:14| Thank you, Mr. Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15136)|
| 4:12:18| Well, Mayor, I was asked a question by Mr. Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15138)|
| 4:12:21| So, Mr. Askew, I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15141)|
| 4:12:24| I think KUB did their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15144)|
| 4:12:26| That's not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15146)|
| 4:12:28| The issue is this process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15148)|
| 4:12:31| And I don't need to restate what I had said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15151)|
| 4:12:35| You did your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15155)|
| 4:12:36| I'm asking for Council to have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15156)|
| 4:12:39| and notify the public about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15159)|
| 4:12:41| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15161)|
| 4:12:42| So, I do appreciate what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15162)|
| 4:12:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15164)|
| 4:12:46| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15166)|
| 4:12:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15168)|
| 4:12:50| A few things, just based on the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15170)|
| 4:12:54| You know, from pure economics and looking at this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15174)|
| 4:13:00| you know, it's the cost, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15180)|
| 4:13:03| I know it's a significant investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15183)|
| 4:13:08| However, looking at the cost of providing broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15188)|
| 4:13:14| is really less than 2% of KUB's billion-dollar annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15194)|
| 4:13:18| And if you're looking at the entire cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15198)|
| 4:13:20| you know, it's a $45 million capital investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15200)|
| 4:13:23| which is 5% of their annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15203)|
| 4:13:27| And if the electrical grid upgrade moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15207)|
| 4:13:31| without the opportunity to provide broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15211)|
| 4:13:34| rates will increase because of that investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15214)|
| 4:13:38| and infrastructure, but with zero revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15218)|
| 4:13:42| to offset that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15222)|
| 4:13:43| And so, that's where I really, you know, struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15223)|
| 4:13:48| And, you know, from a business perspective too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15228)|
| 4:13:52| it will ultimately create, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15232)|
| 4:13:55| $45 million a year for both the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15235)|
| 4:13:59| 5 million of that being realized in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15239)|
| 4:14:03| as this project is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| And those are substantial dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15245)|
| 4:14:09| to go toward any myriad of priorities that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15249)|
| 4:14:16| And, you know, I'm one of those who has experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15256)|
| 4:14:20| the inability to accessible, reliable internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15260)|
| 4:14:25| You know, to provide an internet service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15265)|
| 4:14:28| to a property I currently own from a pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15268)|
| 4:14:31| I could see 50 yards into my driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15271)|
| 4:14:33| was gonna cost me nearly $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15273)|
| 4:14:38| I can't afford that, and I can't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15278)|
| 4:14:40| that many people can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15280)|
| 4:14:43| And if you could, I'm not sure, you know, would you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15283)|
| 4:14:48| And that's not to disparage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15288)|
| 4:14:51| I mean, it's just been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15291)|
| 4:14:52| I understand that, you know, it's been the state of affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15292)|
| 4:14:55| but as a result, I've had to settle for a satellite option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15295)|
| 4:14:59| that's costing me the same as any other ISP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15299)|
| 4:15:02| and impeding the ability to work remotely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15302)|
| 4:15:05| or enjoy live entertainment or et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15305)|
| 4:15:11| You know, I'm very much a capitalist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15311)|
| 4:15:15| and I believe in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15315)|
| 4:15:17| And I have an inordinate amount of respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| for the players on both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15319)|
| 4:15:22| many of whom I call friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15322)|
| 4:15:25| And so it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| It's hard, but this is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15327)|
| 4:15:29| But I also perceive this investment in infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15329)|
| 4:15:34| as an investment toward our future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15334)|
| 4:15:37| for education, for our workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15337)|
| 4:15:39| for professional development, for economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15339)|
| 4:15:43| And I think we can all agree, and I've said this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15343)|
| 4:15:46| that broadband is no longer a luxury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15346)|
| 4:15:50| but a basic need to functioning and being productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15350)|
| 4:15:53| in today's society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| It's not just about being connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15355)|
| 4:15:57| it's about creating opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15357)|
| 4:16:01| And, you know, it's access and options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15361)|
| 4:16:04| and I'm a believer that this doesn't have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15364)|
| 4:16:08| about either or, and I think Councilwoman Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15368)|
| 4:16:11| said it extremely well earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15371)|
| 4:16:14| You know, I equate options and healthy competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15374)|
| 4:16:16| to a rising tide that lifts all boats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15376)|
| 4:16:19| and creates a mutually beneficial landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15379)|
| 4:16:22| that fosters innovation and changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15382)|
| 4:16:25| that for every player in this game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15385)|
| 4:16:30| to be the best version of themselves that they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15390)|
| 4:16:34| So, you know, with that, I mean, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15394)|
| 4:16:38| I've spoken to, I've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15398)|
| 4:16:42| I think we've all tried to do our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15402)|
| 4:16:44| and educate and ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15404)|
| 4:16:47| but, you know, those are my thoughts on where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15407)|
| 4:16:53| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15413)|
| 4:16:54| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15414)|
| 4:16:56| Yeah, I'd like to ask Ms. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15416)|
| 4:16:59| what are the opportunity costs of postponing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15419)|
| 4:17:04| Well, I think several of us in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15424)|
| 4:17:06| could probably give you a couple of different answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15426)|
| 4:17:08| but again, when I think about the opportunity costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15428)|
| 4:17:11| of postponing, I think about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15431)|
| 4:17:15| to be blunt, misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15435)|
| 4:17:17| that has already started to circulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15437)|
| 4:17:19| and I think about the continual confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15439)|
| 4:17:23| that may perpetuate should that misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15443)|
| 4:17:27| continue to fester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15447)|
| 4:17:29| I think about the grant opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15449)|
| 4:17:33| both those in the future as well as those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| that are more stable and more solid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15455)|
| 4:17:38| that KUB needs to align themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15458)|
| 4:17:40| and be positioned to pursue and cannot pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15460)|
| 4:17:44| with any real viability until they are authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15464)|
| 4:17:48| to be a broadband provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15468)|
| 4:17:50| And I also think about, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15470)|
| 4:17:52| the real human technology access cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15472)|
| 4:17:58| of wanting to fill this gap as quickly as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15478)|
| 4:18:02| and so I think, again, we've heard about potential ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15482)|
| 4:18:06| the private market can step into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15486)|
| 4:18:07| and I hope that that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15487)|
| 4:18:08| but I also think that when we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15488)|
| 4:18:10| about the basic need, positioning our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15490)|
| 4:18:12| to pursue this option rapidly is going to be very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15492)|
| 4:18:17| and I also know that as soon as we make this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15497)|
| 4:18:20| there's going to be a new feather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15500)|
| 4:18:23| in our economic development cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| so I'm not the expert on economic development at this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15505)|
| 4:18:28| but I think that, again, this is going to be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15508)|
| 4:18:30| that we can immediately begin to leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15510)|
| 4:18:33| when it comes to our economic viability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15513)|
| 4:18:35| and competitiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15515)|
| 4:18:37| Council Member Ryder, if I could have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15517)|
| 4:18:39| to address that question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15519)|
| 4:18:42| I'm so excited about this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15522)|
| 4:18:43| I've been deeply involved in a number of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15523)|
| 4:18:46| facing our community for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15526)|
| 4:18:49| including some very contentious issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15529)|
| 4:18:51| around schooling, around land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15531)|
| 4:18:53| and I've never seen an issue that has united people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15533)|
| 4:18:56| in such a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| Rural, urban, east, west, north, south parts of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15538)|
| 4:19:03| surrounding counties, small business people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15543)|
| 4:19:07| large, big people, big business people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15547)|
| 4:19:10| who employ hundreds of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15550)|
| 4:19:12| university professors, gig economy workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15552)|
| 4:19:15| advocates who want to help bridge the digital divide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15555)|
| 4:19:19| advocates for sustainability, advocates for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15559)|
| 4:19:24| At one of the meetings of our community advisory panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15564)|
| 4:19:27| Mike Odom from the Knoxville Chamber said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15567)|
| 4:19:30| if this decision is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15570)|
| 4:19:32| if city council approves this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15572)|
| 4:19:33| he would start promoting this to attract business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15573)|
| 4:19:37| and noted the importance of this for education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15577)|
| 4:19:38| and the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15578)|
| 4:19:41| It's rare, it's really rare to have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15581)|
| 4:19:43| that has so much unity around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15583)|
| 4:19:46| So it's something that's popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15586)|
| 4:19:48| and the right thing to do for so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15588)|
| 4:19:51| So I think one thing that benefits us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15591)|
| 4:19:53| from voting on it tonight is momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15593)|
| 4:19:56| We have a lot of positive momentum in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15596)|
| 4:19:59| and this is just going to enhance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15599)|
| 4:20:01| in a really positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15601)|
| 4:20:03| And so I encourage you and the rest of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15603)|
| 4:20:06| to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15606)|
| 4:20:08| So in addition to being able to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15608)|
| 4:20:11| and start marketing ourselves as having that capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15611)|
| 4:20:17| we also will be poised and in the front of the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15617)|
| 4:20:21| for the potential dollars that are coming from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15621)|
| 4:20:24| and potentially the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15624)|
| 4:20:27| which will then make this potentially a lower priced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15627)|
| 4:20:32| less than $3.60, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15632)|
| 4:20:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15635)|
| 4:20:35| Discussing to clarify that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15635)|
| 4:20:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15637)|
| 4:20:38| Okay, I just want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15638)|
| 4:20:41| I remember this being a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15641)|
| 4:20:43| I think it was the 2009 mayoral election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15643)|
| 4:20:46| I believe there was conversations about broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15646)|
| 4:20:49| when Rihero and Padgett ran, I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15649)|
| 4:20:53| Maybe somebody in the media will later tell me I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15653)|
| 4:20:55| but I do believe there being some conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15655)|
| 4:20:58| And I know in elections after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15658)|
| 4:20:59| there were conversations and I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15659)|
| 4:21:03| when I got elected in 2017, lots of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15663)|
| 4:21:07| like Daniel back there were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15667)|
| 4:21:09| you guys have got to do this, you got to push for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15669)|
| 4:21:12| And I met with Mentha Roach at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15672)|
| 4:21:16| and it was no way, no how, never going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15676)|
| 4:21:18| We missed the boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15678)|
| 4:21:20| Well, why did Chattanooga get to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15680)|
| 4:21:21| And we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15681)|
| 4:21:22| Chattanooga was shovel ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15682)|
| 4:21:24| We weren't shovel ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15684)|
| 4:21:25| We're shovel ready now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15685)|
| 4:21:27| And that similar type of funding, love it or not, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15687)|
| 4:21:31| If you're upset about the funding options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15691)|
| 4:21:34| it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15694)|
| 4:21:35| The pandemic happened and the funding's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15695)|
| 4:21:37| We're shovel ready this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15697)|
| 4:21:39| And I don't want to see us miss the boat again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15699)|
| 4:21:42| I'm not trying to rush something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15702)|
| 4:21:43| but we have the opportunity to not miss the boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15703)|
| 4:21:46| and be shovel ready and potentially make this cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15706)|
| 4:21:49| less than the $3.60 that's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15709)|
| 4:21:52| So that is why I feel ready to vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15712)|
| 4:21:58| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15718)|
| 4:21:59| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15719)|
| 4:22:00| Yes, on the subject of delay, I can only speak for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15720)|
| 4:22:05| but I don't feel rushed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15725)|
| 4:22:08| This is something that's been on my mind for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15728)|
| 4:22:11| And also the access to information that I've been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15731)|
| 4:22:15| I didn't ask any questions tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15735)|
| 4:22:17| because quite frankly, all the questions I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15737)|
| 4:22:21| were asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15741)|
| 4:22:24| And this goes to both KUV and officials from Comcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15744)|
| 4:22:27| who were very, very generous with their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15747)|
| 4:22:30| They answered every question I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15750)|
| 4:22:34| went out of their way to provide me any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15754)|
| 4:22:36| that I needed to make my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15756)|
| 4:22:39| I've heard extensively from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15759)|
| 4:22:43| and weighed everything to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15763)|
| 4:22:47| So personally, I don't feel like I need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15767)|
| 4:22:51| I don't know that anything else would add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15771)|
| 4:22:54| to the information that I've been provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15774)|
| 4:22:57| and the questions that I've had answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15777)|
| 4:22:59| So I'm, as Council Person Ryder, I'm ready to vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15779)|
| 4:23:05| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15785)|
| 4:23:06| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15786)|
| 4:23:11| Just one point that I wanted to bring up and caution us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15791)|
| 4:23:17| Because there's obviously a lot of support around this step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15797)|
| 4:23:24| this table for public broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15804)|
| 4:23:28| But I'm not opposed to the proposal that Andrew Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15808)|
| 4:23:33| Council Member Roberto has lifted up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15813)|
| 4:23:37| and who I believe is also a major supporter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15817)|
| 4:23:39| of public broadband, because this is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15819)|
| 4:23:42| We have lifted up increasing access in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15822)|
| 4:23:48| to internet as one of the main reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15828)|
| 4:23:51| for expanding to broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15831)|
| 4:23:55| But we've yet to create a plan for how we're gonna do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15835)|
| 4:23:58| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15838)|
| 4:23:59| My concern is that since there's no dollar figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15839)|
| 4:24:05| we're not saying we will commit the pilot payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15845)|
| 4:24:10| to a low-income program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15850)|
| 4:24:12| We haven't made that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15852)|
| 4:24:13| We've left that open and flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15853)|
| 4:24:15| And so my concern is, and what I will continue to push for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15855)|
| 4:24:20| from this day forward, is that this doesn't turn into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15860)|
| 4:24:23| well, we can only afford to subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15863)|
| 4:24:27| 500 households per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15867)|
| 4:24:29| And it becomes this tiny program that is completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15869)|
| 4:24:33| different than what our community expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15873)|
| 4:24:35| And because we haven't had robust conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15875)|
| 4:24:38| because we haven't been looking at numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15878)|
| 4:24:41| and projections and figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15881)|
| 4:24:43| we can't make those promises to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15883)|
| 4:24:45| All we can go back to our community and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15885)|
| 4:24:48| is that we are committed, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15888)|
| 4:24:51| the administration has committed to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15891)|
| 4:24:54| in a conversation with KUV, a good, safe conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15894)|
| 4:24:58| about how to implement this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15898)|
| 4:25:01| And so, you know, that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15901)|
| 4:25:02| And so that's where I will continue pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15902)|
| 4:25:05| One thing I said to KUV, Gabe Bolus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15905)|
| 4:25:09| is when I'm thinking about a low-income program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15909)|
| 4:25:11| I'm imagining 50,000 households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15911)|
| 4:25:14| because we are a city with at least a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15914)|
| 4:25:17| of our population living in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15917)|
| 4:25:20| So if we're thinking about 50,000 households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15920)|
| 4:25:23| if we're thinking about those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15923)|
| 4:25:26| will still be charged at $65, then that's a good chunk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15926)|
| 4:25:31| if not all of the pilot payment that's coming from KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15931)|
| 4:25:36| And so that's, I just want to put that on record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15936)|
| 4:25:39| and put that out there, that we have to make the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15939)|
| 4:25:42| to our low-income community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15942)|
| 4:25:44| which is a quite large community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15944)|
| 4:25:46| When Mayor Kincannon ran, one thing she reminded us of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15946)|
| 4:25:51| is that we are majority renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15951)|
| 4:25:54| And so I want us to, as a city, make that commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15954)|
| 4:25:58| knowing that it's gonna be a substantial commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15958)|
| 4:26:01| and work towards truly providing the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15961)|
| 4:26:06| for our low-income residents at a significant level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15966)|
| 4:26:10| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15970)|
| 4:26:13| Oh, and one other thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15973)|
| 4:26:14| because I keep forgetting to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15974)|
| 4:26:17| Earlier when I was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15977)|
| 4:26:18| I keep confusing the two programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15978)|
| 4:26:20| and it's because one question I had for KUV going into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15980)|
| 4:26:28| was an update on the relief program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15988)|
| 4:26:31| because we're relying on members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15991)|
| 4:26:35| having access to utility relief programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=15995)|
| 4:26:40| But I have, you know, you sent me a list of programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16000)|
| 4:26:43| and when they were implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16003)|
| 4:26:45| and how much money they were implemented with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16005)|
| 4:26:48| but I don't know how much money remains in those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16008)|
| 4:26:51| And so I'm concerned because the CURE program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16011)|
| 4:26:55| which I believe has 7 million committed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16015)|
| 4:26:59| that 7 million was gone in six weeks or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16019)|
| 4:27:03| It was a really quick time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16023)|
| 4:27:05| And so we do have programs that were introduced in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16025)|
| 4:27:09| but without an update on those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16029)|
| 4:27:11| I'm not sure how much money remains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16031)|
| 4:27:13| and how much the city might need to budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16033)|
| 4:27:16| in future budget years to ensure that assistance continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16036)|
| 4:27:20| Thank you, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16040)|
| 4:27:22| Tiffany Martin, 1825 Avershire Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16042)|
| 4:27:28| and I'm a vice president here at KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16048)|
| 4:27:31| You've valid questions, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16051)|
| 4:27:34| So the CURE program was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16054)|
| 4:27:36| So that was a KUV program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16056)|
| 4:27:38| We used our TVA pandemic credit to serve customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16058)|
| 4:27:42| And you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16062)|
| 4:27:43| There was a great need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16063)|
| 4:27:45| And that's really ultimately why we started the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16065)|
| 4:27:48| We understood that the need was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16068)|
| 4:27:50| At the time that we implemented the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16070)|
| 4:27:53| which technically happened in late December, early January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16073)|
| 4:27:58| we actually started promoting the program in early January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16078)|
| 4:28:02| We've spent about 6.2 million of those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16082)|
| 4:28:06| And so we've about 300,000 left that is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16086)|
| 4:28:10| What was unique about that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16090)|
| 4:28:12| is we were offering that to residential customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16092)|
| 4:28:16| as well as small and mid-sized businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16096)|
| 4:28:18| There was not a program at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16098)|
| 4:28:20| and there still isn't a program to serve businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16100)|
| 4:28:23| So there was an intent to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16103)|
| 4:28:25| that both of those populations were served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16105)|
| 4:28:27| So there's about $300,000 left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16107)|
| 4:28:29| at this point of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16109)|
| 4:28:31| that we have available for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16111)|
| 4:28:35| because they didn't use the program as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16115)|
| 4:28:38| Close to about 9,000 residential customers participated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16118)|
| 4:28:43| almost 8,900, and then about 250 businesses were helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16123)|
| 4:28:50| To address your question related to funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16130)|
| 4:28:53| that is available outside of the CURE program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16133)|
| 4:28:57| we work with a tremendous network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16137)|
| 4:28:59| of partners in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16139)|
| 4:29:01| You all are probably familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16141)|
| 4:29:02| with the Knoxville Housing Assistance Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16142)|
| 4:29:05| that was launched recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16145)|
| 4:29:07| My understanding is that program was launched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16147)|
| 4:29:09| with about $14 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16149)|
| 4:29:11| We've reached out to some of our resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16151)|
| 4:29:13| and I don't have the figure of what's left as of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16153)|
| 4:29:17| but I would tell you that there's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16157)|
| 4:29:18| a significant amount of money left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16158)|
| 4:29:20| because the program was just begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16160)|
| 4:29:23| That program is intended to help with rental assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16163)|
| 4:29:27| so we do have a large renter population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16167)|
| 4:29:29| in the city of Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16169)|
| 4:29:33| It's also to help with utility payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16173)|
| 4:29:35| so it's intended to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16175)|
| 4:29:36| It's intended to serve both those needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16176)|
| 4:29:38| so I suspect that's pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16178)|
| 4:29:41| There are also other funds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16181)|
| 4:29:43| so the Project HELP program that KEB manages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16183)|
| 4:29:46| that program is also available right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16186)|
| 4:29:48| and I think there's about $300,000 available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16188)|
| 4:29:52| And then, as I said, we just have a host of networks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16192)|
| 4:29:56| local churches, other non-profits that serve customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16196)|
| 4:30:01| that generally provide assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16201)|
| 4:30:03| So those funds are kind of spread about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16203)|
| 4:30:05| It's hard to get a total, but I say all that to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16205)|
| 4:30:08| there are funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16208)|
| 4:30:10| As you are helping serve your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16210)|
| 4:30:12| help us get the information out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16212)|
| 4:30:14| because we want those dollars to be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16214)|
| 4:30:16| and for people to be helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16216)|
| 4:30:19| And do we know, we know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16219)|
| 4:30:23| recently KEB entered a new contract with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16223)|
| 4:30:27| and through that there's $10 million coming from TVA per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16227)|
| 4:30:32| Has that money been considered at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16232)|
| 4:30:34| for the broadband work, the low-income program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16234)|
| 4:30:39| So, as far as weatherization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16239)|
| 4:30:41| we've, you know, that's something we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16241)|
| 4:30:43| it began with KEEM a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16243)|
| 4:30:44| and it was kind of a kickoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16244)|
| 4:30:46| to the Knoxville area getting funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16246)|
| 4:30:48| We have since committed $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16248)|
| 4:30:50| in the next 10 years for weatherization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16250)|
| 4:30:52| This year alone, $3.3 million to help weatherize homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16252)|
| 4:30:56| So to go to your question, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16256)|
| 4:30:57| we appreciate your conversations we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16257)|
| 4:30:59| We have a, as Jerry said, a heart for the low-income folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16259)|
| 4:31:02| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16262)|
| 4:31:03| And so part of that money from TVA, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16263)|
| 4:31:05| is going to weatherization of homes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16265)|
| 4:31:11| Ms. Gill, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16271)|
| 4:31:13| Only that I wanted to kind of acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16273)|
| 4:31:16| that your point was, you know, administrations change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16276)|
| 4:31:19| and I think that's part of the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16279)|
| 4:31:21| why we wanted to bring an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16281)|
| 4:31:23| knowing even though there's lots of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16283)|
| 4:31:25| still to be worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16285)|
| 4:31:26| that we felt it was important to bring an agreement to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16286)|
| 4:31:30| that would be on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16290)|
| 4:31:32| because we didn't want to rely simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16292)|
| 4:31:34| on the verbal commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16294)|
| 4:31:35| but we instead have proposed on paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16295)|
| 4:31:37| that 10-year agreement so that it is in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16297)|
| 4:31:40| it is on the books, it is a contract signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16300)|
| 4:31:42| by the mayor and our lawyer and CEO Bolas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16302)|
| 4:31:48| And so again, wanting to see something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16308)|
| 4:31:50| that would stand through potential administration changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16310)|
| 4:31:55| even while recognizing that there is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16315)|
| 4:31:56| a lot of conversations still to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16316)|
| 4:31:58| about what resources are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16318)|
| 4:32:00| and how we can maintain that eligibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16320)|
| 4:32:03| and how to define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16323)|
| 4:32:04| But again, that's partly our intention was to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16324)|
| 4:32:07| we didn't want to bring you one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16327)|
| 4:32:09| without at least putting a firm agreement on paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16329)|
| 4:32:11| for the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16331)|
| 4:32:12| But I appreciate that perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16332)|
| 4:32:13| because it was something that we felt a lot about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16333)|
| 4:32:15| And council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16335)|
| 4:32:18| we have this thing on the next agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16338)|
| 4:32:20| to put this in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16340)|
| 4:32:22| but I'll tell you right here on our public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16342)|
| 4:32:25| equity is part of everything this administration does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16345)|
| 4:32:29| it's part of everything this council has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| You can see items saturating our every agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16351)|
| 4:32:34| including this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16354)|
| 4:32:35| that is dealing with addressing disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16355)|
| 4:32:39| addressing opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16359)|
| 4:32:40| making sure we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16360)|
| 4:32:41| the African American Equity Restoration Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16361)|
| 4:32:44| the disparities issues that we're funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16364)|
| 4:32:48| the funds we do to help with transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16368)|
| 4:32:50| and job opportunities and workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16370)|
| 4:32:53| Everything we do is about extending opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16373)|
| 4:32:56| to the people of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16376)|
| 4:32:57| and addressing issues of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16377)|
| 4:32:59| And I promise that I will do everything I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16379)|
| 4:33:02| to make sure that this is not just about sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16382)|
| 4:33:05| and the symmetric uploads and downloads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16385)|
| 4:33:08| although that's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16388)|
| 4:33:09| it's also about bridging the digital divide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16389)|
| 4:33:12| And I think I say that publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16392)|
| 4:33:14| I'll say it repeatedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16394)|
| 4:33:15| and I know you all stand with me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16395)|
| 4:33:18| And so let's do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16398)|
| 4:33:19| and we can achieve those goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16399)|
| 4:33:21| bridge those digital divides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16401)|
| 4:33:23| and serve all those other positive outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16403)|
| 4:33:26| that you've heard about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16406)|
| 4:33:31| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16411)|
| 4:33:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16412)|
| 4:33:34| We just had our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16414)|
| 4:33:37| and I think the community is here and has weighed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16417)|
| 4:33:40| and I think I've heard overwhelming voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16420)|
| 4:33:44| from the people in the first district, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16424)|
| 4:33:46| that we should be bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16426)|
| 4:33:48| And bold doesn't mean reckless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16428)|
| 4:33:50| and I feel like KUB's done their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16430)|
| 4:33:53| Comcast has bent over backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16433)|
| 4:33:56| The ISPs have played a role in this community for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16436)|
| 4:34:00| and I'm grateful for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16440)|
| 4:34:02| but I think it's time that we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16442)|
| 4:34:04| in this new direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16444)|
| 4:34:07| I think what I've heard from folks is to be bold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16447)|
| 4:34:11| but I think at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16451)|
| 4:34:12| bold would have been 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16452)|
| 4:34:14| and I think we're at a point now where we're behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16454)|
| 4:34:16| And so I'm ready to proceed with a vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16456)|
| 4:34:19| I feel like I've heard enough from these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16459)|
| 4:34:23| from the constituents in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16463)|
| 4:34:26| We've made sure that this is financially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16466)|
| 4:34:29| The net impact of both potential subscribers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16469)|
| 4:34:33| and non-subscribers alike is either zero or positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16473)|
| 4:34:37| The city has a new revenue source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16477)|
| 4:34:40| and we have a broader ecosystem of internet providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16480)|
| 4:34:43| So if it's okay with my colleagues, I'll call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16483)|
| 4:34:48| Okay, the question has been called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16488)|
| 4:34:51| Okay, taking a vote on the calling of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16491)|
| 4:34:55| Is there a second on the motion to call the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16495)|
| 4:34:57| Okay, the motion's been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16497)|
| 4:34:58| to call the question and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16498)|
| 4:35:00| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16500)|
| 4:35:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16502)|
| 4:35:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16503)|
| 4:35:04| Okay, the motion to call the question passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16504)|
| 4:35:08| Now we will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16508)|
| 4:35:09| I will remind council members that to pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16509)|
| 4:35:12| needs six votes, a minimum of six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16512)|
| 4:35:15| Let's, I think it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16515)|
| 4:35:17| to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16517)|
| 4:35:19| Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16519)|

| 4:36:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16569)|
| 4:36:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16577)|
| 4:36:18| Motion made to approve and second that council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16578)|
| 4:36:22| Two people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16582)|
| 4:36:24| Mr. Manal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16584)|
| 4:36:26| Are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16586)|
| 4:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16587)|
| 4:36:29| Mr. Manal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16589)|
| 4:36:30| If you can state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16590)|
| 4:36:33| you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16593)|
| 4:36:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16594)|
| 4:36:35| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16595)|
| 4:36:36| Yes, I'm Kent Nenau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16596)|
| 4:36:37| I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16597)|
| 4:36:40| God, I'm tense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16600)|
| 4:36:42| This is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16602)|
| 4:36:45| Yeah, I'm commenting in favor of Item 11AC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16605)|
| 4:36:51| I think that this is a necessary companion to the previous vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16611)|
| 4:36:56| that you've just taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16616)|
| 4:36:57| I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16617)|
| 4:36:58| That was phew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16618)|
| 4:37:02| How do we get the benefits of the Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16622)|
| 4:37:04| into the hands of the people who need it the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16624)|
| 4:37:07| without breaking fragile household incomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16627)|
| 4:37:11| I think this resolution will help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16631)|
| 4:37:14| but just like my friend Brene Isley said when she was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16634)|
| 4:37:17| it's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16637)|
| 4:37:19| I'd like the council and KUB to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16639)|
| 4:37:22| Utility bills are already listed as primary burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16642)|
| 4:37:25| by neighbors struggling with poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16645)|
| 4:37:27| Two measures would provide real relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16647)|
| 4:37:30| One would be to relieve poor folks of those burdensome fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16650)|
| 4:37:34| that we were just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16654)|
| 4:37:36| We all pay around 80 bucks before we even make our morning toast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16656)|
| 4:37:39| Let residents who are on the waiting list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16659)|
| 4:37:42| for utility-funded efficiency upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16662)|
| 4:37:44| or who qualify for free school lunches have those fees waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16664)|
| 4:37:49| They'll still pay the usage charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16669)|
| 4:37:51| so that everybody will pay the same rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16671)|
| 4:37:54| but getting rid of those fixed fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16674)|
| 4:37:56| would make their lives a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16676)|
| 4:37:58| Second, let's look for ways to speed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16678)|
| 4:38:00| the number of low-income efficiency upgrades each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16680)|
| 4:38:04| I think this is the best thing that KUB does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16684)|
| 4:38:08| for low-income residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16688)|
| 4:38:10| and it makes a difference in the lives of renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16690)|
| 4:38:12| as well as low-income homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16692)|
| 4:38:18| Right now, I'm told there are about 200 upgrades a year that are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16698)|
| 4:38:23| There are 3,000 people on the waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16703)|
| 4:38:26| and at the current rates at the end of 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16706)|
| 4:38:29| only two-thirds of the people on the waiting list will be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16709)|
| 4:38:34| And we just heard that there are 50,000 low-income customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16714)|
| 4:38:38| so that the waiting list is not even a tenth of the actual potential for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16718)|
| 4:38:44| Now, there's an infrastructure bill coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16724)|
| 4:38:47| but the part that will contain climate measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16727)|
| 4:38:49| and energy efficiency is still in contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16729)|
| 4:38:52| So I'm asking you to please keep your eye on the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16732)|
| 4:38:55| of providing some serious additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16735)|
| 4:38:57| for KUB's weatherization and efficiency programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16737)|
| 4:39:01| and I'm thinking about the American Rescue Plan money that we just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16741)|
| 4:39:07| KUB, TVA, and TDEC are all providing additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16747)|
| 4:39:11| for these weatherization programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16751)|
| 4:39:14| They're all being very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16754)|
| 4:39:16| We talked about that $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16756)|
| 4:39:18| That's from TVA, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16758)|
| 4:39:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16759)|
| 4:39:20| And other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16760)|
| 4:39:21| And other sources. Great. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16761)|
| 4:39:23| They're doing great stuff, but we need exponentially more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16763)|
| 4:39:27| A serious influx of supplementary funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16767)|
| 4:39:29| would make possible an energy efficiency jobs program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16769)|
| 4:39:33| like the utility pre-craft training program in Los Angeles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16773)|
| 4:39:37| where low-income youth perform the upgrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16777)|
| 4:39:40| under the supervision of experienced utility workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16780)|
| 4:39:43| while they train for utility careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16783)|
| 4:39:46| Learn while you earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16786)|
| 4:39:47| Relieve burdensome bills and create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16787)|
| 4:39:50| Why not do that here as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16790)|
| 4:39:52| So anyway, yes, please vote for Item 11AC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16792)|
| 4:39:56| Great work tonight, and thank you for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16796)|
| 4:39:59| Thank you, Mr. Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16799)|
| 4:40:03| The next person signed up to speak to this is Mr. Mackey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16803)|
| 4:40:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16812)|
| 4:40:13| Hey there. Good to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16813)|
| 4:40:15| So just on this, again, I want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16815)|
| 4:40:18| that Comcast is committed to getting families connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16818)|
| 4:40:23| and we have over the past 10 years partnered with churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16823)|
| 4:40:28| schools, nonprofits, and governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16828)|
| 4:40:32| local and state governments to get people connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16832)|
| 4:40:35| So on this, just a couple of quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16835)|
| 4:40:39| During the pandemic, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16839)|
| 4:40:41| I just want to mention where Comcast jumped in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16841)|
| 4:40:44| and supported the ENOX effort to get 250 families connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16844)|
| 4:40:50| so they could support online learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16850)|
| 4:40:53| and not just students but also seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16853)|
| 4:40:56| We partnered with the Office on Aging to deploy 250 laptops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16856)|
| 4:41:01| in the hands of seniors as well as a free Internet service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16861)|
| 4:41:06| and then we have also adapted our systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16866)|
| 4:41:09| to facilitate deployment of broadband through subsidies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16869)|
| 4:41:15| like the Federal Government Emergency Broadband Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16875)|
| 4:41:18| So as the city considers subsidizing broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16878)|
| 4:41:22| for low-income families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16882)|
| 4:41:24| we would encourage you to go through a transparent RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16884)|
| 4:41:30| in order to maximize the value of the taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16890)|
| 4:41:35| to get as many people as possible served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16895)|
| 4:41:38| So with that, I would ask not to reject the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16898)|
| 4:41:43| but to maybe open it up to a RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16903)|
| 4:41:48| in order to get the maximum number of options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16908)|
| 4:41:52| in order to get families connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16912)|
| 4:41:55| and maximize the reach of that public dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16915)|
| 4:42:01| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16921)|
| 4:42:03| Thank you, Mr. Mackey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16923)|
| 4:42:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16924)|
| 4:42:06| The next person to sign up to speak to this is Amy Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16926)|
| 4:42:10| Ms. Martin, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16930)|
| 4:42:12| and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16932)|
| 4:42:17| Hello, I'm Amy Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16937)|
| 4:42:18| I'm with the Tennessee Cable and Broadband Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16938)|
| 4:42:22| My address is 2000 Lewis Court, Franklin, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16942)|
| 4:42:26| and I represent the cable industry in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16946)|
| 4:42:29| including Comcast, as Andy just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16949)|
| 4:42:32| And like he said, we support the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16952)|
| 4:42:35| of connecting low-income families in the cable industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16955)|
| 4:42:39| We've been doing that for a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16959)|
| 4:42:41| Actually, Comcast is the first provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16961)|
| 4:42:43| to set up a low-income program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16963)|
| 4:42:46| It's a program that connects kiddos, veterans, seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16966)|
| 4:42:50| anybody who needs to be connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16970)|
| 4:42:52| But we've had a lot of conversation tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16972)|
| 4:42:54| about a fair playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16974)|
| 4:42:56| And for us, this is an example of our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16976)|
| 4:42:59| about a fair playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16979)|
| 4:43:01| If the city is looking to commit dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16981)|
| 4:43:04| to a low-income program, we would request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16984)|
| 4:43:07| that that would go through an RFP program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16987)|
| 4:43:10| have some transparent procurement procedures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16990)|
| 4:43:13| Because you have many current private providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16993)|
| 4:43:17| just not cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16997)|
| 4:43:18| You have others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16998)|
| 4:43:19| You have AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=16999)|
| 4:43:20| I don't represent AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17000)|
| 4:43:21| But you have other private providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17001)|
| 4:43:24| that are doing this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17004)|
| 4:43:26| And we think it's fair and the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17006)|
| 4:43:30| to do from a policy standpoint, from a transparency standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17010)|
| 4:43:33| to open it up to an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17013)|
| 4:43:35| And we would hope you would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17015)|
| 4:43:37| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17017)|
| 4:43:40| Thank you, Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17020)|
| 4:43:42| Council, that's all the people who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17022)|
| 4:43:45| I'm not sure who had their light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17025)|
| 4:43:48| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17028)|
| 4:43:51| I'll call on you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17031)|
| 4:43:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17032)|
| 4:43:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17033)|
| 4:43:55| So one thing I do have to say about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17035)|
| 4:43:58| is that I certainly support looking for avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17038)|
| 4:44:03| and opportunities for equity and ensuring back-to-access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17043)|
| 4:44:11| and that it's being provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17051)|
| 4:44:16| That said, I always struggle with a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17056)|
| 4:44:19| or really anything that comes before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17059)|
| 4:44:22| that doesn't have a clear business plan, strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17062)|
| 4:44:29| with a dollar amount associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17069)|
| 4:44:33| So to me, it's a bit of a blank slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17073)|
| 4:44:36| And here we are looking for additional revenue streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17076)|
| 4:44:41| and yes, we look to potentially realize a pilot payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17081)|
| 4:44:47| of an additional $5 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17087)|
| 4:44:49| close to $5 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17089)|
| 4:44:51| And that said, we're also on a trajectory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17091)|
| 4:44:58| as I think Director Janot can maybe bet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17098)|
| 4:45:04| that expenses are outpacing revenue over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17104)|
| 4:45:09| So I guess my concern is that as we start to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17109)|
| 4:45:15| these new revenue streams to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17115)|
| 4:45:18| and then automatically dedicate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17118)|
| 4:45:21| That said, I also think that there are opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17121)|
| 4:45:25| for, be it foundations, for private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17125)|
| 4:45:29| to be a part of the solutions of creating access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17129)|
| 4:45:34| to low-income individuals in order to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17134)|
| 4:45:39| that they have access to these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17139)|
| 4:45:43| So to that, I struggle with this particular resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17143)|
| 4:45:47| because there isn't something that's clearly outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17147)|
| 4:45:50| and defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17150)|
| 4:45:52| And also, as we are looking at realizing additional dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17152)|
| 4:45:57| I think there needs to be a thorough evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17157)|
| 4:45:59| in looking at other options on how to partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17159)|
| 4:46:03| with some outside entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17163)|
| 4:46:07| Thank you, Council Member Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17167)|
| 4:46:09| Council Member Smith, and then Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17169)|
| 4:46:12| Just two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17172)|
| 4:46:13| I like the idea that was proposed by the speaker just now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17173)|
| 4:46:17| and also want to commend again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17177)|
| 4:46:20| Other than the private companies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17180)|
| 4:46:22| jumped in to help with PPE equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17182)|
| 4:46:24| during the pandemic, Comcast is one of the first ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17184)|
| 4:46:26| to jump in and help kids who are going to work from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17186)|
| 4:46:29| So I like this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17189)|
| 4:46:31| We talked about competition a lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17191)|
| 4:46:33| So I think this is an area where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17193)|
| 4:46:36| can tap into every provider available to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17196)|
| 4:46:40| the equity that we all want to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17200)|
| 4:46:42| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17202)|
| 4:46:44| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17204)|
| 4:46:49| A couple of things, just in follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17209)|
| 4:46:51| to the speaker's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17211)|
| 4:46:54| One concern that I would have with an RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17214)|
| 4:46:58| is that we want low-income community members to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17218)|
| 4:47:03| the same high-speed internet that others have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17223)|
| 4:47:06| And so if we did have an RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17226)|
| 4:47:08| I would want it to be a one-gig symmetrical service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17228)|
| 4:47:12| that we're looking to expand to low-income communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17232)|
| 4:47:16| That's one concern I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17236)|
| 4:47:28| Let me come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17248)|
| 4:47:31| Any other council members have questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17251)|
| 4:47:34| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17254)|
| 4:47:36| Would KUV like to comment on the idea of an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17256)|
| 4:47:39| for this component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17259)|
| 4:47:43| Mr. Wallace or Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17263)|
| 4:47:45| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17265)|
| 4:47:46| So obviously, we're open to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17266)|
| 4:47:49| We want to make sure we help the folks that need it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17269)|
| 4:47:52| Us being this business pays pilots to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17272)|
| 4:47:55| and counties we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17275)|
| 4:47:57| And so that funding needs to be used appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17277)|
| 4:47:59| and spent on the right folks and the right program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17279)|
| 4:48:03| So I can't say we are against anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17283)|
| 4:48:05| that gets more funding than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17285)|
| 4:48:07| I will echo Council Member Testerman's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17287)|
| 4:48:09| We need to have a lot of private funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17289)|
| 4:48:11| to help fill that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17291)|
| 4:48:12| There's a bigger need than just our pilots are going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17292)|
| 4:48:17| And to speak to Council Member Parker's concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17297)|
| 4:48:21| that was one of the reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17301)|
| 4:48:23| one of the key components of our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17303)|
| 4:48:26| was that everybody gets the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17306)|
| 4:48:31| We weren't offering anything less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17311)|
| 4:48:33| than a gigabyte in each direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17313)|
| 4:48:36| because we think the poor deserve as much as the wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17316)|
| 4:48:41| Let me just answer it differently too there, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17321)|
| 4:48:44| I mean, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17324)|
| 4:48:46| We're required by state law to pay those pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17326)|
| 4:48:48| so it leaves our, we have to cut the check to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17328)|
| 4:48:51| every year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17331)|
| 4:48:52| What happens to it from the city on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17332)|
| 4:48:55| is really part of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17335)|
| 4:48:57| we want to have with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17337)|
| 4:48:58| So whatever process we need to set up to get that done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17338)|
| 4:49:01| we have to give that money to you in the counties we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17341)|
| 4:49:04| There's no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17344)|
| 4:49:05| And so that's where I'll leave that at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17345)|
| 4:49:06| just to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17346)|
| 4:49:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17350)|
| 4:49:12| K.E.B., Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17352)|
| 4:49:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17355)|
| 4:49:16| So maybe it's because it's late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17356)|
| 4:49:19| but this particular agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17359)|
| 4:49:24| is describing setting up an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17364)|
| 4:49:27| specifically with K.E.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17367)|
| 4:49:29| to provide service to low-income users and households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17369)|
| 4:49:38| It doesn't have any dollar amount attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17378)|
| 4:49:40| It's just a program that will begin on X date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17380)|
| 4:49:44| So it's got Director Gill's name on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17384)|
| 4:49:47| so maybe you're the right person to call on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17387)|
| 4:49:51| What does that mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17391)|
| 4:49:53| and when does the dollar figure come our way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17393)|
| 4:49:57| So thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17397)|
| 4:49:59| And I think, again, one of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17399)|
| 4:50:02| Just to clarify, this, what's before you, is an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17402)|
| 4:50:05| So it is, again, it's an interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17405)|
| 4:50:09| but nonetheless a firm commitment first by K.E.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17409)|
| 4:50:14| that they will create this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17414)|
| 4:50:16| And I think there's an element, again, of intentionality to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17416)|
| 4:50:20| we wanted something in writing that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17420)|
| 4:50:22| K.E.B., you will create this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17422)|
| 4:50:25| That's the commitment you're making to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17425)|
| 4:50:27| In return, the city is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17427)|
| 4:50:29| we'll commit to come to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17429)|
| 4:50:31| and figure out how we can support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17431)|
| 4:50:33| what resources we can leverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17433)|
| 4:50:34| whether that's our own money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17434)|
| 4:50:36| whether that's helping gain access to other sources of revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17436)|
| 4:50:41| but that we are making that commitment that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17441)|
| 4:50:43| we will make that decision as part of our budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17443)|
| 4:50:46| We will make that commitment to be at the table with K.E.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17446)|
| 4:50:48| to figure out how we can make sure that this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17448)|
| 4:50:50| that we've asked them to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17450)|
| 4:50:52| can be sustained for the benefit of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17452)|
| 4:50:55| So it is not a commitment to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17455)|
| 4:50:58| It is in agreement that we will work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17458)|
| 4:51:01| and, again, hold them to account to create the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17461)|
| 4:51:04| which their board has already done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17464)|
| 4:51:06| but that they'll have it in place by a date certain of July 1, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17466)|
| 4:51:11| and then, again, hold us to the table to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17471)|
| 4:51:13| we're going to figure out how we can support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17473)|
| 4:51:16| and what that looks like on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17476)|
| 4:51:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17479)|
| 4:51:20| So it's us agreeing that we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17480)|
| 4:51:25| but there's no metrics in it for how, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17485)|
| 4:51:28| I don't see any metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17488)|
| 4:51:30| That's correct, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17490)|
| 4:51:32| we've heard that may be unsatisfying to some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17492)|
| 4:51:34| but at the same time, again, we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17494)|
| 4:51:37| to Jamie's point earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17497)|
| 4:51:39| exactly what resources will be on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17499)|
| 4:51:41| and we know that there's an additional level of build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17501)|
| 4:51:45| that K.E.B. needs to do on their own paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17505)|
| 4:51:47| and their own plans so that we can even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17507)|
| 4:51:49| what it is that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17509)|
| 4:51:51| So because it doesn't describe any scale or any metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17511)|
| 4:51:55| or any dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17515)|
| 4:51:57| it also would leave me to make the statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17517)|
| 4:51:59| that it doesn't preclude anything else additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17519)|
| 4:52:03| like Mr. Matthew hinted at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17523)|
| 4:52:05| as possibly an RFP to do something for additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17525)|
| 4:52:08| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17528)|
| 4:52:09| It doesn't preclude us from also seeking similar types of agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17529)|
| 4:52:13| or RFPs in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17533)|
| 4:52:15| We welcome all people who want to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17535)|
| 4:52:17| address these equity issues and bridge the digital divide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17537)|
| 4:52:20| and K.E.B., as of tonight, is now one of those partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17540)|
| 4:52:25| but we can do something similar with other partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17545)|
| 4:52:28| in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17548)|
| 4:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17550)|
| 4:52:34| Council Member Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17554)|
| 4:52:35| and then we'll go back to Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17555)|
| 4:52:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17557)|
| 4:52:39| I would like to go on the record and say that I would request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17559)|
| 4:52:43| that the administration put out an RFP to anyone and everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17563)|
| 4:52:49| who wants to help provide low-income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17569)|
| 4:52:52| As we just said, it's not mutually exclusive if we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17572)|
| 4:52:56| but I am saying on the record I want you to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17576)|
| 4:53:00| I would want the administration to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17580)|
| 4:53:02| because I think to speak to the fair competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17582)|
| 4:53:06| that's one of the things that has been a concern for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17586)|
| 4:53:11| that that is going to become the narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17591)|
| 4:53:16| that we are trying to stifle competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17596)|
| 4:53:19| and I think if we, as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17599)|
| 4:53:21| say that we are committed to helping anyone and everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17601)|
| 4:53:24| through any provider that wants to work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17604)|
| 4:53:28| I think that we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17608)|
| 4:53:30| So I'm requesting that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17610)|
| 4:53:31| I'm not opposed to voting for this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17611)|
| 4:53:33| but this is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17613)|
| 4:53:38| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17618)|
| 4:53:39| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17619)|
| 4:53:42| So I'm trying to understand what our obligations would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17622)|
| 4:53:47| once the low-income program begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17627)|
| 4:53:51| So if we, I'm going to use a pandemic as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17631)|
| 4:53:55| because it's fresh on our minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17635)|
| 4:53:57| but if we start this program, we commit to a low-income program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17637)|
| 4:54:02| we have 5,000 people in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17642)|
| 4:54:06| a pandemic hits, and our budget is severely impacted by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17646)|
| 4:54:12| Does that mean essentially we have to cancel that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17652)|
| 4:54:18| and individuals will lose their internet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17658)|
| 4:54:21| Would there be another option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17661)|
| 4:54:23| Well, Ms. Parker, I would say the pandemic is a great example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17663)|
| 4:54:26| because the pandemic did hit us in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17666)|
| 4:54:29| and we spent more money and dedicated more resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17669)|
| 4:54:33| to helping people who were struggling than ever before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17673)|
| 4:54:36| and I think we would endeavor to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17676)|
| 4:54:39| Can we make exact commitments for what that would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17679)|
| 4:54:42| and what the dollar amount would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17682)|
| 4:54:44| I mean, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17684)|
| 4:54:45| Let me change my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17685)|
| 4:54:46| I'm asking more of a contractual question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17686)|
| 4:54:49| because when I look at this interlocal agreement, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17689)|
| 4:54:52| it makes me think about the massive interlocal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17692)|
| 4:54:55| that's about to come before us potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17695)|
| 4:54:58| around this sports stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17698)|
| 4:55:02| It's a completely different agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17702)|
| 4:55:04| I've read this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17704)|
| 4:55:05| and it does not seem to commit us to any debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17705)|
| 4:55:09| that KUV would take on, but it commits us to this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17709)|
| 4:55:14| and so I'm just trying to understand contractually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17714)|
| 4:55:20| Actually, it might be in here, and I might have missed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17720)|
| 4:55:23| but is this something that we have an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17723)|
| 4:55:25| to withdraw from on an annual basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17725)|
| 4:55:31| Is there a time commitment to this interlocal agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17731)|
| 4:55:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17735)|
| 4:55:36| Ms. Gill can answer those two questions, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17736)|
| 4:55:38| So just, again, the term of the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17738)|
| 4:55:41| that, again, that force that brings us to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17741)|
| 4:55:45| that term is for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17745)|
| 4:55:47| It automatically renews every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17747)|
| 4:55:51| unless we decide to terminate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17751)|
| 4:55:53| So, again, we've tried to set this up for the long haul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17753)|
| 4:55:55| with, again, that expectation of a 10-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17755)|
| 4:55:58| I'm looking myself through this idea of terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17758)|
| 4:56:03| I think Charles can always advise us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17763)|
| 4:56:06| to what our hard and fast things are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17766)|
| 4:56:09| but, again, we've set out a term in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17769)|
| 4:56:11| that very clearly says it shall commence on the effective date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17771)|
| 4:56:14| and expire 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17774)|
| 4:56:16| and that effective date begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17776)|
| 4:56:17| when they create the program, not today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17777)|
| 4:56:20| And so, again, we want to see this in the long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17780)|
| 4:56:23| and, again, all of that is automatically renewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17783)|
| 4:56:25| for one year unless we decide at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17785)|
| 4:56:28| that we would not want to do that with 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17788)|
| 4:56:31| And that's not a city council decision, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17791)|
| 4:56:34| to withdraw from the 10-year agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17794)|
| 4:56:39| It would not be for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17799)|
| 4:56:42| However, again, I think what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17802)|
| 4:56:45| as our contracts work, and Charles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17805)|
| 4:56:47| I'll defer to you here, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17807)|
| 4:56:49| we would be looking to having a city council decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17809)|
| 4:56:52| as part of that budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17812)|
| 4:56:54| because any funding that we give would be part of that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17814)|
| 4:56:58| But the term that's in here is the 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17818)|
| 4:57:01| just like our other contracts that have terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17821)|
| 4:57:04| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17824)|
| 4:57:05| From our perspective, the value of this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17825)|
| 4:57:08| is KUB's commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17828)|
| 4:57:11| We have solidified KUB's agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17831)|
| 4:57:15| to participate in this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17835)|
| 4:57:18| that's going to provide this Internet service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17838)|
| 4:57:22| to those who otherwise might not be able to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17842)|
| 4:57:26| We want that to happen for as long as it can happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17846)|
| 4:57:29| but we have committed them to the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17849)|
| 4:57:33| that are in this agreement, which is a 10-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17853)|
| 4:57:37| So that's the commitment that we're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17857)|
| 4:57:42| If we want to get out of this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17862)|
| 4:57:44| I suspect KUB's not going to give us a real big problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17864)|
| 4:57:47| about getting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17867)|
| 4:57:50| The duty is on them and not on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17870)|
| 4:57:52| and so we're grateful to have the interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17872)|
| 4:57:56| and we're going to utilize that interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17876)|
| 4:57:58| the commitment that we get from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17878)|
| 4:58:00| If we can get commitment from others, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17880)|
| 4:58:03| We're welcome to have commitment from others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17883)|
| 4:58:07| But what we thought was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17887)|
| 4:58:09| was to get a commitment out of KUB for a long-term period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17889)|
| 4:58:14| that they're going to work with us in this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17894)|
| 4:58:17| so that we can get Internet to people who need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17897)|
| 4:58:21| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17901)|
| 4:58:23| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17903)|
| 4:58:26| Seeing none, there was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17906)|
| 4:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17909)|
| 4:58:30| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17910)|
| 4:58:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17912)|
| 4:58:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17913)|
| 4:58:34| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17914)|
| 4:58:35| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17915)|
| 4:58:36| Motion carries 8-0 with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17916)|
| 4:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17919)|
| 4:58:40| Make that two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17920)|
| 4:58:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17921)|
| 4:58:42| Motion carries 7-0 with two abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17922)|
| 4:58:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17926)|
| 4:58:47| We still have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17927)|
| 4:58:50| But two people signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17930)|
| 4:58:55| The first one is Marie Alcorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17935)|
| 4:58:57| Ms. Alcorn, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17937)|
| 4:59:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17944)|
| 4:59:05| Maybe she isn't here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17945)|
| 4:59:07| Greg Ducey, you are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17947)|
| 4:59:11| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17951)|
| 4:59:12| You all worked hard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17952)|
| 4:59:13| I'm going to give my time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17953)|
| 4:59:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17956)|
| 4:59:17| Thank you, Greg, for that objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17957)|
| 4:59:18| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17958)|
| 4:59:19| Meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17959)|
| 4:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17960)|
| 4:59:21| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17961)|
| 4:59:22| Let us kiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17962)|
| 4:59:23| Oh, I love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210629?start=17963)|
