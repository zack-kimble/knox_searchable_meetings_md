| 0:12:16| and you'll note that that number has lessened in this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| but that truly is where we focus most of our dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| with our community providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Going down to the Knox County-specific data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| if you'll turn to the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| you will note that in Knox County in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| you had about 32,870 residents that were estimated to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=753)|

| 0:12:43| Over the age of nine, I think it's important to note that 30,000 of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| were eligible to be served through private or public insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| So when you look at who's serving who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| that part's very important to take note of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| But when you look at those that had no insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| based on those numbers, 2,680 uninsured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| we had Helen Ross McNabb, Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=785)|

| 0:13:14| through the Safety Net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| So we actually served more than those that were estimated to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| severe mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| That's because you had the increases with COVID that we know are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=803)|

| 0:13:34| the same information about the 485,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| You'll note the breakdown very similar to those that are privately insured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| and covered as well as those that have public insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| TennCare, Medicare, and VA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| And then finally, the number that are uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| If you go to that next slide to look at how many we served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| this is where we've got a larger gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| So we had 3,000 that were estimated to not have insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| and we served through the local providers 2,433 Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| 30,000 should have gotten services through either private insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| or through public insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| So that sort of shows you that we still have a gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| and we constantly talk with our governor as well as the legislature about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=857)|

| 0:18:56| So when you look at serving a small number of individuals in a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1136)|

| 0:19:39| again, we were told, well, you're not serving as many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| because you closed Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1182)|

| 0:20:06| more people were served in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1206)|

| 0:20:15| I wanted you all to see what we're keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1215)|

| 0:20:19| because we've gotten a lot of feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| about sheriffs are having to transport everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| The reason I wanted to show you this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| is that you will note in the fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Knox County is the one that actually did have to transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| individuals to Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| either because it was a forensics case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| and the local network could not deal with that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| or they were too high acuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| or they were not able to be actually stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| But I want you to know those other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| that we've kept up with, really not that high of a transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| So those are the numbers through FY21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| With the pandemic, those numbers went down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| because there were fewer hospitalizations during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| So it's pretty much followed this trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1263)|

| 0:23:28| So we've worked real closely together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| and I don't even almost have to ask her in the committee now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| because she just goes ahead and answers it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| because she knows we're going to try to keep her accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| to make sure those resources stay in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| But thank you for your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| and I think it will help members to have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Absolutely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1426)|

| 0:23:57| I really appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1437)|

| 0:24:02| Commissioner, just to make sure we keep you on your schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1442)|

| 0:24:08| Well, we'll have some questions towards the end then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1454)|

| 0:24:18| Tony Benton from Tenova| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| and David Hall from UT Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| My name's Tony Benton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| I'm the CEO for the Tenova East Market Hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| and we appreciate the opportunity to be able to present to you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| and want to thank Senator Massey, Senator Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| and Knoxville City and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| for the support of what we've started to make inroads on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| and would like to share where we stand currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| with the impact on our hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| and the health care system in the local region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| For hospitals, we are established and set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| to take much better care of medical patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| In behavioral health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| when some of the acute care facilities closed, like Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| a lot of that burden was carried through the local health care systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| and it's not the best location to take care of behavioral health patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| It's an inefficient and very costly way to deal with those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| A lot of times those patients show up in our emergency departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| and that's just not the best setting for a behavioral health patient in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| It's difficult to manage their care in the emergency department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| and it's difficult for other patients receiving care in the emergency department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| to be in that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| And so we've been working collaboratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| and with the governments to help to better address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| But this is obviously a very vulnerable set of patients that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| and as we talked about, these patients have, over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| ended up, from a crisis perspective, in the emergency departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| where if they can be medically cleared and are stabilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| we try and get them to an outpatient care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Or if they're not stable, oftentimes they end up boarding in the emergency department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| and unfortunately it's not rare that those patients are in the emergency department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| for upwards three, four, or five days until they can get those placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| And the placement is difficult from a capacity perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| as well as it is from a transportation perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| So a lot of challenges with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| and ultimately being able to care for these patients in an environment that's suitable for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| and for caregivers delivering that type of care is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Just to share a little bit of the impact for our Tenova Healthcare System| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| and UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| in 2021 we had 780 behavioral health patients in our two metro facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| North Knoxville Medical Center and Turkey Creek Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| and UT had more than double that, 2,000 behavioral health patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| And they, again, come through our emergency departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| and will sometimes be admitted into the facility if there's medical issues to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1659)|
| 0:27:47| or they'll board there until we can get them into care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| As you can see, a number of those, 59% and 40% respectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| were discharged to those psych hospitals and facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| which often went out of the Knoxville community to receive that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| We've included the top five diagnoses for the two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| Those are similar for both of ours, suicide ideation, acute psychosis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| psychological disorder, behavioral disorder, and substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| So very similar at both of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| And as you can see, the average length of stay in our emergency department is pretty close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| about four hours and 50 hours respectively in our two facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| So not the best location for care for the behavioral health patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| And a significant financial impact, as that was shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| a lot of these aren't reimbursed and are in categories like a Medicaid that don't cover the cost of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| certainly in a high-cost setting like an emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| To understand what we need for the patient population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| I think it's good to understand the health care continuum and where these patients seek care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| And when you think of the behavioral health patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| the pre-crisis state of being able to seek care in a primary care clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| in an outpatient behavioral health provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| obviously this is analogous to in the medical community going to your primary care doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| or getting kind of basic preventative care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Once these patients move into a crisis situation, those settings are no longer appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| And so you look at settings like a behavioral health urgent care center, the emergency department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| ending up in the inpatient hospital setting, mobile crisis units, crisis stabilization units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| and inpatient behavioral health hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| So all of those are part of that continuum of care to address a patient in a crisis state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| And then the goal, obviously, is to get that patient transitioned from a crisis state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| into a recovery and maintenance state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| And you have a number of care settings, rehabilitation centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| the intensive outpatient treatment centers, behavioral health providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| primary care clinics, and support groups to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| So the good news that we have in this is that we are really starting to address a lot of those pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| of the continuum of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| I think we could all go through each of those buckets and identify that there have been gaps in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| But we're well on our way to filling those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| And one of those is part of the continuum is inpatient medical facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| inpatient behavioral health facility, the Center for Behavioral Medicine that we were opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| that we did open with our ribbon cutting last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| We started to see our first patients April 25th there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| So very excited about this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| It's a 64-bed facility that will serve geropsych patients as well as adult and substance abuse patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| So it's a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| It's helping us get to where we need from that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| So excited to have that and the support from the community to be able to bring this to the Knoxville region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1886)|
| 0:31:34| So I'll turn over to my colleague, David Hall, from UT Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thanks, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| You'll hear a lot today about our emergency facility for emergency services and people in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1903)|
| 0:31:51| There's about somewhere in the vicinity of 8,500 or 10,000 people in crisis in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| And when they come, you think about the families and not in the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| And Commissioner Williams did a fantastic job of telling you, hey, we got a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| We don't need to send people to the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| And getting people to call in those particular situations can be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| So what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| They send them to the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| You know how stimulating that is if you've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| And you think about that and somebody has a behavioral health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| But at the same time, they've got a medical problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| See, 68% of the people that have a behavioral health disorder have also a co-occurring medical chronic condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1941)|
| 0:32:29| And so when they come to the hospital, we're clearing them medically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| And then we're sitting and waiting for behavioral health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And so to be able to have this emergency services center and what McNab is doing with all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1956)|
| 0:32:45| the city, the county, and the state, along with the local hospitals, all three systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| is putting together a facility where people can come in and be medically cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| and then get straight into mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| That's going to have a huge impact not only on our emergency rooms but on the quality of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| And so we all ought to thank each other because it's taken all of us to do this, to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| It is a pilot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| So with any pilot project, we've got to really be invested in making it work because it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| You saw a lot of money from Commissioner Williams out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| We want to be able to spend that money, spend it wisely, and make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| So there's going to be a lot of effort going forth, and we may come to you and tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| hey, this is what's going well and this is what's not going well, and we may need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| So we're excited about that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| But that's, you know, we tend to think in the hospital business about the individuals that are in crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| but there's still a big number of people, as Commissioner depicted earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| that have mental health disorders that aren't in crisis or can be prevented from coming into crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| And so we have some gaps in that care too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| And right now in our system, in the hospital systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| typically primary care physicians are the ones that are getting individuals that have behavioral health disorders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| mainly because they're coming in for their medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| And so they need somebody to help co-manage, co-manage those patients with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| They'll help with the medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| They're trained to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| They do a really good job of that, but they still need the psychotherapy services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| other services down the line where only mental health professionals can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| And so we have a gap there, two gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| One is we don't have enough mental health providers in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| That's another reason that we're really excited about what Commissioner Williams has put forth in training new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| so that we can have people to take care of individuals and co-management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| co-management with the primary care physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| So we've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| We have a need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And then we have a need to connect those two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| So think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| You know, you're coming into a primary care visit, and then you're trying to make another appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| get somebody that's dealing with issues or getting ready to deal with an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| and you can't get them to where they need to go because, you know, you're waiting in line again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| Two cues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| You've got a cue at your primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| You've got a cue at your behavioral health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Time lapses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| What happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| We get crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| We go to the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| So with the McNabb Center, one of the things that we're working on is a behavioral health hub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| which allows the connection between those two and access standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| So what McNabb has done with us is make it so that if a primary care needs somebody seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| and they have this criteria is met, it's seen within a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| And so if we have enough providers and we have a way to connect these people, we can co-manage the care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| And then there's a responsibility for the information that comes back that allows those things to go forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| That's still a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| It's a pilot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| To take that across our county is a larger effort and something that we may want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| And then, you know, we talk about behavioral health, and as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| a lot of focus gets to be on substance abuse, and it also is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| We have a medically-assisted treatment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| We've got some grant funding for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| And what that does is allows us to start treating people for substance abuse before they leave the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2181)|
| 0:36:27| We've been reluctant to do that because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| you don't want to start people down this drug therapy and then send them out to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| And so what we're trying to do is make sure that we have some connection also with McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| on getting these people into a program that's medically-assisted treatment, but it's continued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| and we feel pretty good about them getting their care and not going out and relapsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| So we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Some other technical issues, we do want to be able to test for fentanyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Right now we have no FDA-approved test for fentanyl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| It's a horrible problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| We're trying to get that so that we can start treatment earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| and start getting people on the road to recovery, so that's a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| So what we've got on our outpatient side, a lack of providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| We need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| We also need telehealth and transportation as part of the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| because, you know, there's got to be that ability maybe in a primary care office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| to actually see the patient with a mental health provider right then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| after they've seen their primary care with telehealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| That would be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| And getting people back and forth to their appointments is always difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| and so that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| We have a lot of stuff on substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| We have some great programs around peer navigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| We actually put in bed in all the hospitals individuals that have had substance abuse problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| and have gone through the treatment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| and so we use them as peer navigators to people that are currently having problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| So that crisis population, you're able to deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| So we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| If we have more support for telehealth, we have some more support for peer navigators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| we actually have more treatment centers and more sober living sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| I think we'll do better as a community in providing care to this very difficult population that are sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| So in closing, we're using our resources as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| We're building outpatient hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| We're putting money along with everybody else into our emergency treatment facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| and working on innovative ways to deal with people with mental health disorders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| but it takes a whole village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| So we will be, as we go through these pilot projects, if we see how they work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| we'll continue to work with you all and keep you up to date on things that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| and things that we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you very much, Mr. Hall and Mr. Benton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Really appreciate your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| We'll do questions at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Next up we've got Liz Clary from Peninsula and Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2332)|
| 0:39:02| Welcome and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| I have to lower this down or grow some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| I don't know which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| One, I'd like to thank Commissioner Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Commissioner Williams and her team have been such a great partner for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| and we really, truly appreciate everything you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| We have a grant to be able to take care of the uninsured at Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| I guess I should introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| I'm Liz Clary, and I'm the VP of Behavioral for Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| Peninsula is a division of Park West Medical Center, and we're a member of Covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| But Commissioner Williams, we've been able to work really closely with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| and to be able to take care of these patients that are uninsured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| because it's the uninsured that keep coming into our EDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| that are creating where they stay in the ED for days and days on without any kind of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2394)|
| 0:40:03| And those are the patients that need help because if you don't help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| and really come up with a sustained plan for these patients, then guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| They come right back into the ED, and they come right back to Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| So I really do appreciate the state's help with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| and understanding some of the issues that we've had in caring for these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| I think a lot of money has been poured out into the community from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| and I think there's a lot of good programs that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| I do think that we could do a better job with working together to be able to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| all right, you all have Helen Ross-McNabb, you have this program, and it is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| so we're going to utilize that for some of our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| Or to Nova, you all have a great, which we really do appreciate for senior behavioral especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| That is going to fill a huge niche for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| So kids, kids are another vital component of mental health needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| and we're seeing an increase in that every day at Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| So those patients, again, are in our EDs for days at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| and we could really do some partnership within our community with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| The other thing is if we could have a more robust case management program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| HealthLink is a wonderful program for TennCare patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| If we could have something like that for our uninsured, which we have pockets of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Peninsula itself works with CARM, and we provide a therapist there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| and we provide an outreach specialist to really hone in on some of the patients that are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| that have psychiatric issues, that continue to come into the ED for a varied set of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| It's the social determinants that will not allow them to be able to take care of their mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| And so those are the things that we really need to work together on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| As far as the EDs, our biggest challenge, I think, is transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2543)|
| 0:42:30| When we finally get them into, they'll stay for days, as David alluded to, in the EDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| but then we will, then when we finally get a place for them to go, we can wait up to 24 hours for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2558)|
| 0:42:47| And that became really, really bad at a time with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| And, again, I'm sure lack of resources for everyone involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| So if we could come up with some innovative ways as a city, as a county, to be able to transport those patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2576)|
| 0:43:06| I think it would really help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| As far as outpatient, again, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| It's a workforce shortage, and we have really struggled with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| as well as some of the state facilities, as well as some of the private facilities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2598)|
| 0:43:28| And it's really caused a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| Peninsula itself has had to decrease their beds capacity because of lack of psych techs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2611)|
| 0:43:40| a lack of RNs, and a lack of therapists for outpatient especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| So those all play in the part of being able to care for these patients in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| If we could do something with housing, if you all had like a magic bullet or something that would help us with housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| that would be amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Housing is also, again, if you don't take care of those basic needs for some of the patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| then they will continue every time it gets cold, every time it gets too hot, every time they become lonely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| They'll end up back in our EDs, as well as some of their coping skills, their lack of coping skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2659)|
| 0:44:31| And unfortunately, and Commissioner Williams knows this very well, they know exactly what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| These patients know exactly what to say to be able to be admitted into the hospital, into the psychiatric hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| But they also know they can buy their time and have warmth and protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| and support while they're waiting for a bed at a psychiatric facility in the EDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| So housing is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| There's a lot going on to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| But it still becomes an issue of where do you send these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| Where do you send these people when they know they're going back out in the stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| So those are my main takeaways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| Everything else, everyone, I'm just going to echo what everyone else has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| because there's no place in me repeating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| But we do love to take care of these patients, and we want to be able to serve them in the best way that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2731)|
| 0:45:41| So to work as a community with your support, I think, would be excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| Thank you, Ms. Cleary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| I appreciate it, and thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Next up, we've got Ben Harrington with the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| And I believe you had done a report for county commission just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| I shared that with council, and thank you for putting that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| and we're looking forward to hearing from you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| So welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Well, thank you very much for the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Thank you all for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| This is, I think, the first of its kind, getting both bodies together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| the Knoxville Legislative Delegation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| That's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| And so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| We do appreciate your interest in mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| So I have to do a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| First of all, I have to teach you a little bit about mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| Fifty percent of everyone with a mental health condition will have their very first symptoms start by age 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| After that, crickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2803)|

| 0:46:54| So that is problematic, especially since we know that early intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| and prevention really works and can save money with downstream costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| So it starts early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Fifty percent will have their symptoms by age 14, 75 percent by age 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| There are also four stages of mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| very much like there are four stages of medical conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Obviously, we would want to intervene as far upstream as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| And as Commissioner Williams told you earlier in her remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| most of the people that need mental health care need it in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| not necessarily in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| The dilemma that we have here is the longer folks delay their entry into treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| their condition might indeed worsen, become much more impairing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| if not disabling, and then they become part of the public sector population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| So we do want to intervene earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Now, I do need to brag a little bit about the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| We have been in existence since 1948, and we actually do a lot of things that are far upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2886)|
| 0:48:15| For example, the MHA of East Tennessee, I'm proud to say, and Commissioner Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| I don't think I've ever said it in your presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| we operate the largest school-based mental health education program in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| because of the support of the department and residents of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| to make sure that we can teach kids how to recognize symptoms in their peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| so that folks can be intervened with in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| where there are so many excellent school-based services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| We couldn't do that without the state's support and so many other folks' support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| We also operate a very unique program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| and I think in Tennessee we are the only state in the country with department funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| for a free mental health screening program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| And what we're doing in East Tennessee is we are screening more than 13,000 people last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| to identify their mental health treatment need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| They're troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| They don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Is it stress or is it worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Is it something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| So last year we screened 13,533 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Eighty percent screened positive, and that gives them the motivation to then take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| Where do I find a place to get help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| We're on pace to screen about 15,000 people this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| and so that's important because we've had so many things happen in recent years with COVID, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| but a lot more people are now struggling with their mental health than ever before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| A couple of statistics you need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Fifty-one percent of all employees, all people who work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| 51 percent of adults are struggling with their mental health today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| Seventy-one percent of our health care workers are struggling with their mental health today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| So that indicates we've got problems that are a result of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| and now I need to turn to kind of the perfect storm, as I call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| The pandemic caused a huge surge in people needing to access care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| We saw it in our call center with about a 25 percent increase in clients calling us saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| hey, I need a place, and we would have to try to find them a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Our friends at McNabb and Peninsula and Cherokee and so many other places saw similar surges of people needing care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| and so we had that surge in demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Literally, CDC has pegged the number at about 41 percent of adults now need mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| I will caution you that that does not mean they're all seriously mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| The CDC definition is any mental illness, whereas the state commissioner here discussed the serious mental illness designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3054)|
| 0:51:05| So what you have is a lot more people needing help, but as Commissioner Williams alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| the majority of those folks need it in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| If they can't get it in the private sector, we're going to have problems downstream in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| So a couple of things you need to know about our perfect storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| First of all, our excellent public sector providers, McNabb, Cherokee, Peninsula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| they have a mental health workforce shortage, and it's ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| It's not anything recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| It's something we've struggled with for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| But at the same time that they have that shortage, we've had a significant increase in the turnover rate at those providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3102)|
| 0:51:51| So add those two things together, surge of demand, turnover rate increasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| so there's less capacity to serve the people we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| The next thing I want to share, and I'm going to point at the commissioner again and remind you what she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| most of those people who need mental health care are not the department's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| They are folks that need to be seen in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| They have private insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Well, we've got a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| And the problem is that very few professionals in Knox County are taking new patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| And I'm going to throw a number at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Less than 10% of licensed mental health professionals in Knox County, Tennessee, today are taking a new patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3152)|
| 0:52:42| That means what you've got, as Senator Massey said, you've got mental health whack-a-mole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| That's exactly what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| If you have a provider list, you are calling your provider list looking for a psychiatrist that's taking a new patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3170)|
| 0:52:58| or a therapist who's taking a new patient, and you better hope that that mole sticks its head up so you can smack it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| and you can claim it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Now, the dilemma there is that person may not be appropriate for your need, may not have expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| but you've had to play high-stakes whack-a-mole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| So that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| So we've got lots of issues that, fortunately, the brain trust here in this room, the providers, the state have helped with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3197)|
| 0:53:27| but we have this one looming one over our shoulders here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| It is the workforce shortage, and we have to create some local solutions to solve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| The commissioner, she asked the governor for funding and did not receive it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| to create some resources to help break that logjam and incentivize people to choose Tennessee and work in public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3225)|
| 0:53:55| Unfortunately, we were not able to see that in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| But that doesn't mean we have to sit pat and stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| We have to look at local solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Are there dollars that have not been spent from ARPA or anything else that we can cobble together here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| to help us provide a talent pool to be able to recruit folks to choose Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3252)|
| 0:54:20| and work in public sector mental health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| That's vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Another thing I would like to point out to you is we have extremely limited numbers of mental health professionals of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| And so we need to use the same type of pool to recruit persons of color and Spanish-speaking professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| because when people need a professional, they need someone who gets them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| and they need someone who is going to be culturally appropriate as well as linguistically appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| So we need to look at some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Now, our legislative friends, I'm going to tell you something that we need your help with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| It does not do us any good as employers to have provider lists that our employees can access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| from our insurance plans, and then they can call every provider on the list, and they can strike out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| They can call 25 names, and they have nobody taking a new patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| So that's, in my eyes, a legislative issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| It's a mental health parity issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3321)|

| 0:55:25| And I don't know who we talk with at the Department of Commerce and Insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| but just having a provider list does not mean you, your employees, your colleagues, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3330)|

| 0:56:04| We need those resources to help with recruiting new professionals to choose Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3364)|

| 0:56:20| and we need some legislative help to make sure those provider lists are accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| and people are taking new patients instead of slamming the door on people who need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3386)|

| 0:57:18| A couple of things I echo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| I mean, Ben Harrington, Ben knows more about this than a lot of people in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| and I can't improve on his comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| I can give you a few facts when we're talking about the law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| and talking about the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| As many of you on the County Commission know, probably the City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| the Sheriff of Knox County runs the largest mental health facility in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3463)|

| 0:57:55| It depends on who you wish to talk to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| Those professionals have been there for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| but the estimate is anywhere from 15 to 25 percent on daily average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| Those that we have locked up suffer from significant mental illness problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| At 5 o'clock this afternoon, we had 1,099 people locked up in Knox County on our 5 o'clock count this very afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3495)|
| 0:58:26| So you can figure that in your head that we're dealing with 200 to 300 people that are very difficult to manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3506)|
| 0:58:38| because they are sick, and we have them locked up the wrong place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3518)|
| 0:58:48| The talk has been that we've talked about the problems in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3528)|
| 0:58:57| The cruisers that the Sheriff's Office uses to transport people from here to Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| most frequently other places, of course, but Moccasin Bend most frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| we're having to change the oil in those cruisers every three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| I think we made 2,368 trips to Chattanooga, Tennessee, with a sick person in the back of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3555)|
| 0:59:24| We've made some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| We were having great difficulty at one point in time in that when we would get to Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| they would not be admitted, and so we would put them back in the car and drive them back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| We fixed that a little bit with the telemedicine where there's some more conversation between the physicians now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| and that problem has abated itself to a certain extent, but it is still a major, major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3587)|
| 0:59:58| Last year, the taxpayers in Knox County spent $117,670.03 on psychotropic medications in the Knox County jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3598)|
| 1:00:14| I don't guess there needs to be much more said than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| That shows that we have some very, very sick people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| When you look at the population that we are dealing with in the detention facility, as mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3625)|
| 1:00:39| so many of those people that are suffering from mental illness have a co-occurring disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| in that they are addicted to narcotics, and that just doubles our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| Aaron Pershing over here made me read a book, The Least of Us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| I encourage you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3658)|

| 1:01:05| This is about the new game in town, and it's called methamphetamine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| and we, ladies and gentlemen, have a major problem with this substance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3671)|
| 1:01:19| and what's happening now is that they are doing the analogs and the isotopes on the fentanyl, which will kid you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3679)|
| 1:01:32| and so now when you talk to Dr. Milusevic or talk to Sharm Allen, General Allen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| look what all we're seeing in the system now, and there's some drugs now that's coming along with methamphetamine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| I can't pronounce the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3706)|

| 1:01:51| I can't pronounce the name of the drugs, but we moved from heroin to fentanyl, which is an elephant tranquilizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| and now we're doing carfentanil, which will kill a rhinoceros with a gram of a grain of carfentanil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3720)|
| 1:02:11| and they continue to move and expand on it to try to keep ahead of law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| and this methamphetamine that's now being ingested is causing significant mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3738)|
| 1:02:29| so it exacerbates itself when you're already suffering, and now you become addicted to this substance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| and we're not finding many people that have success in breaking the addiction to methamphetamine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| It's very, very difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3763)|

| 1:07:20| but a place to feel safe and secure, to have a sense of community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4040)|

| 1:07:52| because all of us have more than just the sum of one experience in our life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| and that is important for us as an agency and for my staff to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| and respect the personhood of everybody who crosses that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| As we know, that what underlies some of our discussion tonight is that experience of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4090)|
| 1:08:18| We oftentimes put together the experience of having mental health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4098)|

| 1:08:47| where the Lisa does not have to demonstrate her motivation for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4127)|

| 1:09:03| So I stand here tonight pleading to develop housing that is not only affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| but is not only appropriate, but also accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4151)|

| 1:09:16| Permanent supportive housing is not the optimum type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| but in dealing with the experience of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| you do not do it until housing is part of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| In September, we'll be opening our second permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4170)|

| 1:09:51| That is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| As one of our residents at Menvilla Manor said sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4194)|

| 1:10:22| So the challenge in our community is to develop places where indeed new traditions can be created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4222)|
| 1:10:31| new habits formed, and yes, my friends and fellow residents of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4231)|

| 1:12:12| and our legislative body who's attending and helped organize a lot of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| have sat in city council or county commission chairs, so they've seen this issue grow over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| and they have contributed to solutions that have been effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| You know, if I'm sitting in your chair, I'm a little worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| It's a little overwhelming to hear the volume of problems that our community is facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4349)|

| 1:22:50| If we can identify the right judge and have the right supports, we can have a mental health court in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4970)|

| 1:25:24| And I know it all hasn't happened in four years, but to have historically all three of our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5124)|
| 1:25:32| literally every elected official sitting around the table and to hear all of what is being presented today is incredibly optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5132)|
| 1:25:41| I have more hope for the future of our mental health than I think I've ever had just hearing everyone leaning in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5141)|
| 1:25:50| This is not despair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| And I think that is a good thing to better understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| Ms. Williams, I have one question, if I could, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| I've heard you had a quick thing in your slide that I sort of missed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| and I've heard from different constituents and medical professionals about children's mental health needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| I'm excited to hear about the children's hospital stabilization unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| but one thing that seems to be continuously lacking is local inpatient services for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| And to hear what it takes to send people to Moccasin Bend as an adult is one level of stress and urgency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5190)|
| 1:26:41| but to think about a child going through something similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| is that on the state's horizon at all for more facilities that focus on inpatient for children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5205)|
| 1:26:52| I'm really glad you brought that up, and I want to go back to what Randy said about your trips back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| I want to remind you that those trips back and forth are not just for uninsured, 10-care-covered individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| They're also for privately funded individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| So when you look at these trips and the oil changes that you're having to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| please go back to the slide that we're going to send you that shows you the small number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| that are actually coming from the uninsured population and the 10-care-covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| because that's what each of these individuals are talking about, and you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| There's a reason to have hope, because if you looked at your trips 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| and you looked at that number of private versus public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| you would see, if you go back, how many of those were actually public-funded individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| that you were transporting after Lakeshore closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| So I feel really good about our telehealth that you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| So I feel good, like you said, about what we're doing with adults as it relates to kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| That is something that our deputy commissioner, Matt Yancey, has totally led,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| and it has been in coordination with 10-care, with the legislature, with the governor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| and with our providers, and I can tell you that when we did the last stats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| and Matt, I'll ask you to come up here with me because you really have been the leader of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| When we did our last stats, we did not prove that there was a higher need for kids last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| than the year before, and so we're watching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| But, Matt, anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| Mr. J., I think one of the things that we have focused on as a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| are the community-based services and supports that we know children need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| Certainly certain kids are going to need inpatient care at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| I think as far as our department goes and focused on uninsured Tennesseans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| we're fortunate that in the state of Tennessee, at least 95%, 96% of kids have a payer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| Half are covered by 10-care, the remaining commercially covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| We have funded a children's behavioral health safety net for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| community-based treatment focused on uninsured children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I think, as Jerry mentioned, with the CSU here at East Tennessee Children's Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| we're looking at that as a possible model in lieu of inpatient treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| Obviously our partners at 10-care would be instrumental in that review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| and looking at the efficacy of that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| But I think from our perspective, there are certainly times when children need inpatient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| Most children need early intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Most children need co-located mental health services in their local school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| If children are going to receive mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| oftentimes they're going to receive them in the school setting itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| And again, trying to divert kids from hospitalization, divert children from residential treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| The efficacy of residential treatment as it relates to kids is not great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Most children with mental health needs, they do better off in home with their parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| or their caretakers with the right services and supports in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5400)|

| 1:30:05| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| I just want to first say thank you, Commissioner Williams and your staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| for making the trip and being here today, and all of our local community partners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| A couple of things very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| Very concerning was the transports, the Knox County transports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| the number which was so disproportionately displayed compared to the other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| I think you guys have already touched on that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| But also I would be interested if you could maybe e-mail this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| the average length of stay at Moccasin Bend when someone is transported there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| unless you have that off the top of your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| So, again, Ty Thornton is our Chief of Staff and Head of Hospital Operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| Ty, we look at this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Do you want to come up here and tell them what that average length of stay is for the acute individuals coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| So the average length of stay at Moccasin Bend, it runs, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| our last staffing report we got was right around six, six and a half days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| which is in line with our other facilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| And so I know terminology has changed quite a bit in mental health and substance abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| since I worked at Peninsula Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| but I also wanted to bring to our attention with Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| there was long-term care that was provided there at Lakeshore at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| for those who were considered chronically mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| What do we have primarily that addresses the needs of those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| or do we have anything from a state perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| I was intricately involved with Helen Ross McNabb and others when we closed Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| We had 95 individuals that were there when we started and announced that closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| As Senator Massey said, it was on her third day on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| And I will tell you, of that 95, there were about 50, am I right, Jerry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| that actually had been there long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| And what we developed, and when you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| I'm sorry we couldn't show that chart where you could read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| you will see that we more than matched long-term residential housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| and got those individuals in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| And in that first year of that housing, it's my understanding only one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| came back to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| And that points to what Bruce said about the need for safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| affordable, quality, permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| Some of these individuals had been in Lakeshore for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| Forty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5565)|

| 1:35:36| And we don't have lots of professionals in our community who are persons of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5736)|

| 1:35:57| And so we have this distinct need to recruit persons of color because a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5757)|

| 1:46:30| And then it's basically up to the individual and their lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| if they want to have a mental evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| a motion is filed, the judge would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| Jerry and his people would go do the mental evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| and be taken somewhere else to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| So everything really depends on the nature of the charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| Yeah, I've seen the list of how much it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| for all of the medications that are given out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| Well, there's no doubt that there are a number of very sick people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| that are incarcerated as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| Council Member Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| I've got several other folks who wanted to ask questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| So as I was saying, there are some rosy pictures out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Yet last week I decided to call around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| and see what kind of resources I could find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| And it took two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| and I still don't have a bed or medical detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6446)|
| 1:47:32| Called around, called around, and there was nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| So if the answer is we have enough resources, I don't feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Representative Johnson, you are next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| Can I respond to that question or response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| In our chart we said there's a gap for substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| So you brought up the issue of detox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| and it took you two weeks to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| And also Jerry spoke about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| We do have a gap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| Now we had $6 million allocated this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| that's going to come to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| Part of that, that our legislative members approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| that will allow us to build out detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| In addition to that, we've got the opioid abatement dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| that are coming both to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| as well as to the locales to get dollars to build that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| So we do have a gap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| I'm not saying it's rosy there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| but I'm saying that we actually are working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| increasing those resources with our providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| Representative Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| I guess I'm going to go a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| I love that so many of the community partners know the state well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| They're working well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| We've increased funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| I appreciate all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| However, I think we have to talk more about the difference with Medicaid expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| especially because in the other states that we've got over 40 studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| that show for those who expanded how well it's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| And different states looked at different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| Michigan looked at how many people were back on the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| because they got the physical health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| and the mental health care that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| In Ohio, we saw ten times more people were able to be treated for addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| because they expanded Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| And so what I would like to hear from our community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| whoever is willing, to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| and just the community partners speak to how it would improve their situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6574)|
| 1:49:43| and what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| Start calling names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| I think it's important to talk about the difference it can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6594)|
| 1:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Mr. Harrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| I knew you were going to ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| I'm going to ask more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Yeah, probably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| I would say that it's important to note that the prospect of Medicaid expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| is also one of those what came first, the chicken and the egg type of scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| Yes, there are states that have had that circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| where they have dramatically increased access and utilization of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| But I also know that we here in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| have a dilemma with public sector access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| because of an increase of professionals turning over at McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| and Peninsula and Cherokee, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| So we've got a dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Yes, expanding Medicaid might seem like a great answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| because in all these other states it's increased access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| But at the same time, we still got the question of the chicken and the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| Where are we going to get the folks to work in public sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| to be able to achieve the result that you're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| So those are some things I would just put out there for folks to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| as they consider the question of Medicaid expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| And I guess if they build it, they will come maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| But what about either somebody from Helen Ross or UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| Representative Johnson, I'm going to move on to the next question after this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| because I've got other folks waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| This is Jerry Wagner with McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Medicaid expansion would obviously infuse the state with additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| The problem we would experience as a provider is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| under our state is managed Medicaid state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| We have contracts with three managed care organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| Until this year, and if you exclude the state of Tennessee requiring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| until this year, most behavioral health organizations have not had an increase in rates in over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| So bringing more money that's underfunded doesn't really help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| I mean, that's sort of the dilemma that I would see with an expanded Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| So we would have to have reform with that expanded Medicaid for it to be meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| This year, we're really, really grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| TenCare directed the three managed care companies to give outpatient mental health centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| an improvement in the rate reimbursement of about 14% on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| But that is, if you think about it, that's averaged over ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| That's not even 2% a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| Maybe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| Maybe my math's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| I'm looking at Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| Is my math wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| It's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| I know it's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| But that's sort of the dilemma that we see with expanded Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| It's not really the panacea for us in the behavioral health spaces that we thought might be on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6787)|

| 1:53:11| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6791)|

| 1:53:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor, for recognizing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| I listened to all y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| It's overwhelming to hear all these situations coming from everybody in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| Making notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Man, it looks like I'm taking a test tomorrow morning if I can answer all these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| My thing is, can we make it a little bit easier if somebody needs help to go to one spot and get directions from that one spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6820)|
| 1:53:52| If I was starting right now, I've got ten people I need to call to find out if they're operating in a situation that can help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6832)|
| 1:54:02| And it got more confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| And me being a commissioner for this will be my eighth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| I'll be going off in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| I'm just now starting to learn how to navigate the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| And it's taken me that long to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| I just understand how people out there that need help, where do they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| Who do they ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| And they say, well, you go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| And they go, well, yeah, we can do this here, but we can't do it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| Maybe they could do it better over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| So how do we get to that one spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| Can you all figure out a way to where we have one person we can contact and have them to get their help pinpointed right away to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6879)|
| 1:54:49| They don't have to ask all these questions that we're asking right now to find out who do we need to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| And that would be my one thing for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| Can you all do that for us and make it a lot simpler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| Commissioner Hill, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Can I answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| This is really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| That's the, I mean, amen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| I really appreciate what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| Because the state has given funds, as you saw, for all different kinds of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6916)|
| 1:55:25| But I'm telling you, it's fatigue for a case manager from the mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6925)|
| 1:55:31| It's fatigue for a therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| It's fatigue for everyone to figure out who does what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| And it's up to us as a community to be able to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| So that when our patients are on that ever-ending wheel of not knowing where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6942)|
| 1:55:48| and not even having the transportation or the means to be able to pick up the phone and call to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| it's just so overwhelming to them that we have more boots on the ground to be able to help them get to those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6954)|
| 1:56:02| And that's not the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| That's us as a community being able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Just as a segue on that, I'm wondering if the crisis line were to be called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| would they be able to at least start with the initial direction of where someone needed to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| Commissioner Williams, perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| Or Jerry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| Yeah, the McNabb Center operates the psychiatric crisis line for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| And if anybody calls, honestly, half of those calls are information and getting them to where they need to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6995)|
| 1:56:43| and the other half are really the crisis response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| So it does service that issue for a lot of community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| Commissioner Blechler, if you think about it, this new urgent care psychiatric facility we're talking about at St. Mary's campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7010)|
| 1:56:57| all payers, all kind of patients, so if they show up there, they're going to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| That will be one place we can be assured they'll get redirected if they're not needed to be treated right at that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| And also as kind of a segue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Could I also weigh in, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| The Mental Health Association of East Tennessee operates a one-of-a-kind facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| It's called the Peer Recovery Call Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| Every call is answered by a person with lived experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| That means they have a diagnosis and they are expert at helping people find the right place to get their care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| whether it's public sector, private sector, uninsured, does not matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| And that number is 865-584-9125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| I just would like to briefly address your comments about workforce and, you know, the need for more professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7065)|
| 1:57:57| I'm wondering if there's anything as a body that we can do, or if there's anything collectively that you all could perhaps do that isn't being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7077)|
| 1:58:07| or try to initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| I'm certain that you all use UT greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| I can only speak to the College of Social Work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| They turn out many, many graduate students every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| I'm sure psych services and all do also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| And if you're going after those students, local providers, and if you are and they're not staying, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7106)|
| 1:58:38| Is there a gap there perhaps that we could entice these young people to stay, these young mental health professionals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7118)|
| 1:58:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| Again, Deputy Commissioner Yancey led a workforce workgroup looking at this very issue with TennCare this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7128)|
| 1:58:57| All of us were integral into giving feedback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| What I'll do is get you the report, Senator Massey and Andrew, and have you all send it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| because we asked in the budget this year for specific items to do what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| Work with UT, get them dollars to do retention, and also pay for stipends, all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7152)|
| 1:59:20| And so we've really laid that out very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| One thing the governor said, and I agree with this, is that he felt like we first needed to address the salaries of the current workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7163)|
| 1:59:32| which is why that $18 million was put in the budget along with TennCare's increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| But I can promise you that this next year we will be coming back to the governor and our legislature to ask for that workforce package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7177)|
| 1:59:45| that actually includes what you're talking about in working with social work classes and departments across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| I need to weigh in on that, please, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| The state of mental health report that Knox County Commission and Mayor Jacobs commissioned with the Mental Health Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7200)|
| 2:00:08| the primary recommendation was to address the behavioral health workforce issues that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| and it was literally ripping off the commissioner's recommendation to the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| but to have a county-specific mental health provider recruitment fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| And that, in my eyes, could incentivize people to choose Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| help pay their medical school student loan debt or graduate school debt, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7232)|
| 2:00:40| incentivize them to choose Knoxville, commit them for five years, and then even offer the prospect of retention bonus money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| So that idea is highly complementary of the state, but we need a specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7249)|
| 2:00:58| The commissioner asked for that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| The governor couldn't do it just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| But we need to get people to choose us and choose Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| and there's not a reason in the world, in my eyes, for Knox County, the city of Knoxville, big entities like the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7267)|
| 2:01:16| which obviously would have to think forward how many students it has to train to place here to meet our needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| the College of Social Work, College of Nursing, et cetera, United Way, large foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7283)|
| 2:01:29| We work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7289)|
| 2:01:30| We could solve this and put the money on the table to create such a fund and recruit people for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7290)|
| 2:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7301)|
| 2:01:42| Representative McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| And, you know, it's kind of interesting, as you manage this really collegial bunch, it harkens back to the days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7307)|
| 2:01:55| Senator Briggs and I served with 19 folks with red lights all over the place that were pretty ornery, so great job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7315)|
| 2:02:04| But it also, you know, harkens back to the days where we were discussing what we were going to do with the Fifth Avenue Motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| and it was good to hear Bruce talk about the success of Men Villa because that did not come easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| You know, this commission argued over the square footage, you know, cost per square foot of building a Men Villa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7338)|
| 2:02:27| We argued successfully subsequent to my serving on county commission about that day facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7347)|
| 2:02:35| that overnight out-of-jail experience that Knox County and the Sheriff's Department is now running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7355)|
| 2:02:43| So there have been a lot of successes over the years as we talk about this, how are we going to deal with this within this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7363)|
| 2:02:52| and really with the demise of Lakeshore, you know, two things I'll comment on, and they were brought out today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7372)|
| 2:03:00| but extremely important, and not just in mental health, but our reimbursement rates in this part of the state are just not adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7380)|
| 2:03:10| And I do applaud the governor for putting half of it there, but that's not, we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7390)|
| 2:03:19| We are way behind in terms of health care reimbursement rates from our governmental entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7399)|
| 2:03:30| so we need to do whatever we can to get those on par with what it takes to manage, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7410)|
| 2:03:37| be able to hire and recruit and retain people in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| It just doesn't, those ends just don't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| So I know the Tenovas and UTs and Helen Ross McNabs are struggling mightily with that, so we need to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7427)|
| 2:03:57| But the other piece, and I do appreciate Senator Massey asking the question each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| I'm not on anyone's health committee, but I do know that, and I'll ask you to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7442)|
| 2:04:09| I know that when you look at, we had 95 folks in Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| and Lakeshore was an institution like Moccasin being is, that's no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| So my question is, I know we're trying to fill in for that loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| but what are the gaps that still exist with us not having an on-site, long, short-term mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7465)|
| 2:04:37| comprehensive mental health facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| I appreciate the three hospitals and doing what they're doing there off Meadowbrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| appreciate what we're doing at St. Mary's, but I know there's still gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| What are those gaps and how are we going to address those mental health gaps of the people that we're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| currently within our county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7494)|
| 2:05:05| A couple of things, really appreciate you asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| In the slideshow, we show that we're actually serving more people through our three contracted hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| than when Lakeshore closed by almost double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| So if you looked at numbers served, you would see there really aren't gaps based on numbers served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7517)|
| 2:05:24| When you look at the spreadsheet that Senator Massey's asked for every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| and then a handout that you'll get in your packet, you're going to see all of the actual units of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7528)|
| 2:05:36| that are currently funded to provide what you're talking about, that long-term care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| But then to finally look at, because there's not a state hospital here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| and we were talking about the fact that there are some individuals that we showed you are coming to Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7546)|
| 2:05:52| I would say that is the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| They're coming to Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| And we're doing the best we can to help continue to fund those services that keep people here at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7556)|
| 2:06:03| And I know our three contracted hospitals are doing the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| I'm really applauding all the expansion with UT Tenova, and I think Acadia is coming in and increasing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7566)|
| 2:06:13| But I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| And when you get the spreadsheet, if you've got any questions, please call our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7575)|

| 2:06:32| I wasn't aware of the private agreements with the institutions that you mentioned that replaced Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| At least I wasn't aware of all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| What's the capacity at those facilities now and or wait time, if I need to be admitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7600)|
