| 0:00:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=23)|
| 0:00:26| We will have the invocation by Mayor Brown and the pledge by Chairwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=26)|
| 0:00:32| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another opportunity to serve the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=32)|
| 0:00:39| We ask that we would listen attentively to what is being presented tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| Also ask that those who are less fortunate, those who are homeless and find themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=45)|
| 0:00:52| without food or shelter, that you would be with them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| Bless our nation, our state, and our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=62)|
| 0:01:11| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| I'll roll again what Marshall said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| For traffic signal modernization, Mr. Hagerman, it's all yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| The signal modernization project is a major effort for the city, and every time it's come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=91)|
| 0:01:44| up in front of Council, we've gotten lots of questions, lots of interest, and so I requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| that we have an opportunity to get into a little more of details so that you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| better what's going on with it and what the scope is, what the expected outcome is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Signal systems are a pretty complicated bunch of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| They're a combination of cutting-edge technology, including computer technology and communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=136)|
| 0:02:23| technology, and they fundamentally try to regulate human behavior, which makes it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| much more complicated, and it, of course, is all constrained by staff and budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| In order to try to develop some of the best solutions for all of these problems, we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=156)|
| 0:02:46| do, well, we came up with some funding with the help of transportation planning organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| We're currently funded at $7 million for the first phase of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| We did an RFQ to get consultant help with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| It was a very competitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| That's not a good thing to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| We had some very competitive proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| The project, the contract was awarded to Kim Lehorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| John Benditz of Kim Lehorn is going to present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| Apparently we're not going to have a slideshow since his computer keeps crashing, but he'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| talk you through the presentation that is at your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| In addition to John, we have some staff here to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| We're backed up by Jeff Branham, who's chief traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| Ernie Pierce on my immediate left here is our signal engineer, and Zach Roberts is his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| understudy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| He's a recent hire in the traffic engineering department, and he's also an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| Do the signals work better than John's computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| We certainly hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| It makes us a little nervous, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| I'll give it to John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Give me one second here, let me get the password in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| Maybe the fourth time is a charm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| We'll try it when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| Had a really nice PowerPoint presentation for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| I think we have it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Yeah, I made copies of the PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| I'm just going to talk to you from the slides that you have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| Jim had originally asked to try to keep the presentation to about 30 minutes, and it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| like maybe 30 minutes is more than what you need, so I'll try to keep it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| more brief if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| But the first thing I'd like to touch on, you hear the acronyms, ATMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| It's been a major program, a lot of funding associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| In our industry, the intelligent transportation system industry, we use a lot of acronyms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| There's a lot of confusion in terms of what all this means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| To try to simplify what the ATMS program is for the city, I've used one of a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| from the Federal Highway Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Advanced traffic management systems improve vehicular flow using a combination of technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| that count vehicles and measure speed and communicate with traffic signal control equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| to adjust signal systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| So basically, it's an advanced computerized traffic signal system that's built around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| a pretty advanced communications network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| The objectives of the ATMS program is to maximize the available capacity your current roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Your ability to add new capacity to your roadway systems is really financially constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| It's very expensive to add new capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| So the technology is designed to try to squeeze as much of the capacity out of what you already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| have as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| It's also intended to minimize the amount of vehicular accidents that you see on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| We talk about it managing mobility demand, and what that means is traffic has a nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=413)|
| 0:07:04| to seek the path of least resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| If the place where you're trying to accommodate it, which is the arterial networks, is what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| designed to move your heavy traffic, becomes overly congested, it pushes that demand out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| into areas where you don't want it, into neighborhoods and different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| So one of the purposes of the ATMS system is to keep the traffic where it's intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| But the bottom line is it's to basically advance mobility, safety, and minimize the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=449)|
| 0:07:38| of citizen complaints that you have from the flow of traffic on your arterial networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| There's several key building blocks that we talk about when you build an ATMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| The first building block is your local control equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| And you see the shiny boxes on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| There's really a great deal of, those are microprocessors in themselves, a lot of hardware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| in that cabinetry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| You've got about $15,000 or greater of electronics and cabinetry electronics just in those boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=490)|
| 0:08:20| alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| And that is a key building block of the ATMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| You already have some of those in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| You're constantly needing to update and modernize those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| Another element of the program is a communication network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| For the take advantage of the intelligence that's within the control equipment itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| it needs to be able to communicate with the other devices surrounding it as well as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| some central processor that can communicate to all the devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| To allow that to happen, a communications network is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| There are other elements that you're not as commonly available to your current systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| that you may not be as familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Vehicular detection systems, the systems need to monitor the volumes and the speed of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| to make intelligent decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| So there is additional detection systems that will be added to your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Closed circuit televisions to allow your operators to confirm what's occurring on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| And dynamic message signs, not nearly as extensive as what you see in the state's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| smart way system on the freeway systems where that is a primary component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| But you may see some limited use of dynamic message signs within the arterial network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| When you look at that key infrastructure, I think it's important to sit back and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| where is Knoxville today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Where's the starting point that you're building the system with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| I don't know how many people are aware of the fact, but Knoxville actually had one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| the very first computerized signal systems in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| It was installed in advance of the 82 World's Fair and was one of the most advanced systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| in the country at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Since that point in time, a lot of that infrastructure that was installed at that point has diminished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=620)|
| 0:10:29| and gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| In advance of this particular program, the city looked at the state of the current system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=630)|
| 0:10:39| and what they found about a year or so ago when that study was completed was that 88%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| of that local control equipment, the expensive shiny boxes on the side of the road that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| mentioned earlier, about 88% of those were over its typical lifespan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| And close to 75% were more than five years over its lifespan, meaning that the city was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| basically holding their signal system together with bailing wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| Also, at that time, there was about 40% of the system that had no form of communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Of the 60% which did have communications, some of that is some antiquated communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| that doesn't fully meet the needs and requirements of a modern system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| So the building, the starting point for the city is a lot of replacement of existing equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=695)|
| 0:11:43| as well as the addition of new components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| Some of the features you may be asking that you will see in the new system, at the heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| of any signal system is the progression and movement of traffic through the coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| of traffic signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| You have a lot of your signals coordinated today, at least in some rudimentary fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| The timing patterns are developed from traffic counts that are made at a point in time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| you hope are going to be representative of the patterns that you'll see going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| The longer they're in place, the less representative they become of the actual conditions in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| One of the things with an advanced traffic management system is it has the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| do real-time selection of patterns based on actual conditions in the street and in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| cases can actually make some refinement of the timing patterns on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| To make your patterns be much more effective than the best guess assumption that's made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| years in advance of the actual timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Does the machine do this automatically or is this relayed to an operator to say, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| know, new information, we're saying two minute intervals or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Yeah, there's actually two ways of doing this and most of that decision in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=784)|
| 0:13:13| area is not made locally, it's made through the central software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| All these controllers will be communicated back to a centralized site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| They will analyze the conditions and decide which locations need to have their timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| adjusted and will send out the commands through the communication structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| But your central servers back at your operation center will be the ones making those kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| of decisions for this particular feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| Another feature is what we call integrated corridors and a good example of that is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| West Knoxville where I-75 and Kingston Pike run parallel very close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=833)|
| 0:14:02| The operations on Kingston Pike is very closely affected by the travel conditions on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=842)|
| 0:14:10| Under normal conditions, we may have patterns in place, but when conditions start to break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| down on the interstate, all of a sudden substantial traffic which is ordinarily not accounted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| for looks to migrate to these parallel corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| And by creating linkages between the systems, the state has put extensive investment already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| in the freeway systems with their smartway systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| Once the ATMS program is in place, we can create bridges and links between those systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| and we can see where some of those increases will be hitting before they actually overload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| A couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Can I ask a question about Kingston Pike specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| It seems to me there may be an opportunity and most traffic engineers have pushed back on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| but the major intersections down Kingston Pike, in my opinion, may be benefited by traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| circles which don't stop traffic but slow it down but let it keep moving and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| environmentally it's a whole lot more friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Is that considered at all in this instead of stopping traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| As part of the ATMS deployment, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| I mean, you're talking about geometric improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| This is really doing the instrumentation along the current configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| So, you know, if there were traffic circles in place, the system would be designed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| account for and accommodate those, but in terms of physical reconstruction, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| really not going to be any physical construction as part of the ATMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| It's basically trying to squeeze everything it can out of the lanes that are already in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| place in the form they're in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Now, when we go through and develop the timing patterns and optimizations, a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| we will make recommendations beyond what the physical lanes will accommodate and identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=969)|
| 0:16:19| improvements that would greatly enhance, but those are basically recommendations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| the traffic engineering department puts away and uses to prioritize for future construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=985)|
| 0:16:34| opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| Two additional functions that you'll see in an ATMS system, one is the ability to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=999)|
| 0:16:48| enhanced special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| There's several good examples of that here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| Probably the best example of that is football Saturdays at the university where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| upwards of 100,000 visitors that aren't normally on the road systems during those time periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| The ability to generate special patterns and adjust to rapidly changing conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| on the fly is greatly enhanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| One of the areas that a lot of cities are starting to use is transit priority corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| which allows the traffic system to communicate with the transit onboard systems to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1048)|
| 0:17:38| behind schedule and can use the signal system to get that fleet back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| It's not a preemption system like you would see with emergency vehicles in the past where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| they would turn on the lights and the lights would turn green until they got through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| intersection, but there are some accommodations that can be made and that's one possible feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| you could see in this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| The system provides a toolbox both for your traffic engineers to manage the traffic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| your signal technicians to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| On the traffic engineering side, the toolbox will provide the traffic engineers with access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1095)|
| 0:18:24| to local intersection performance measures and corridor performance measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| They'll be able to see real time what is happening in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| When complaints come in, a lot of times complaints are from a certain point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| There may be unique conditions occurring when that complaint is registered and when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| traffic engineer goes out to inspect the conditions later, that same condition is not present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| and it's hard to match up the complaint to what adjustment, if any, is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| One of the things the system does is constantly monitors what's going on and records all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| activity and so the traffic engineering resources will be able to go back and look at long histories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| of performance to see trends that are occurring rather than trying to catch them on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| There's also accommodations in there to help facilitate updating and replacing your signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| timing along the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| On the signal maintenance side, there's several tools that's really geared towards your maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| technicians as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| One is real time failure reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Right now, a lot of it depends on, again, reports from the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| When something goes wrong that needs to be dispatched and respond to and some of these failures can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1193)|
| 0:20:03| so subtle that they may go unrecognized for days or maybe even weeks, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| it's greatly diminishing the effectiveness of the intersection until they get reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| With an ATMS system, there's real time monitoring of the conditions when a failure occurs in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| The maintenance folks are notified immediately and are able to respond more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1222)|
| 0:20:32| Where the project stands right now, just to give you a quick overview of the actual activity, as Jim mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1232)|
| 0:20:41| we're going to be developing the plans and specifications for the initial phase of this deployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1241)|
| 0:20:50| We were selected, Gimley Horn was selected and got started on this project just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| Right now, we're in a phase with TDOT, we have to go through NEPA permitting, which is some environmental permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1258)|
| 0:21:08| Even though there's no physical construction, we still have to go through the exercise of demonstrating that there are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| environmental impacts before we're cleared to get into hard design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| That process will take a period of a few months to get that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| In the meantime, we've initiated-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| You can't just write none?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| We can write none, but it doesn't get us our approval to commence design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1291)|
| 0:21:41| Once we've cleared that phase, the design will be starting up here in the next month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| The design will be completed towards the end of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| Construction will- No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| The summer of 2016, about this time next year, and the construction will be underway by the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| Construction will take approximately a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| What we have gotten started and some of the elements in our study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| we'll be meeting next week with the stakeholders in this region, the other transportation stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1334)|
| 0:22:22| the other cities and counties surrounding Knoxville, the emergency responders, the Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1342)|
| 0:22:34| the transit people, the transportation planning group that maintains the regional architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| All of these stakeholders will be working together and we will be finalizing what possible additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1361)|
| 0:22:50| and capabilities we'll be incorporating into the final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| From that will come a master plan, plans and specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| A lot of the specifications- I mentioned this program is going to be deployed over a couple different phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1379)|
| 0:23:09| but in this initial phase, we'll be developing all of the details and specifications and so forth for the entire project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| so that effort won't have to be replicated with the subsequent programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| We'll also be developing new timing patterns for the corridors that will be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1403)|
| 0:23:31| Project funding, because this project was included in what's called the regional ITS architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1411)|
| 0:23:40| intelligent transportation system architecture, a large planning document that covers the entire region, not just the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| it is eligible for federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| The initial funding for this deployment is coming from STP funding, $7 million, 80% of that is federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| and 20% is local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| I don't know if y'all heard last week there was another award that TDOT made to the city for a CMAQ grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1443)|
| 0:24:13| which is almost another $2 million worth of funding that will be 100% federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1453)|
| 0:24:23| That's more than your $7 million, so what's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| Like I say, the $7 million is going to be the initial phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| It's not going to cover full build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| There are additional...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| But you've got $9 million shown, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| You've got $7 million in the STP funding and the other $2 million that just got awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| Yeah, our project, the project we're engaged with is just for the $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| The $2 million was just awarded last week, but it's another pot of funds that have been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| to help continue to advance the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| Question, I have a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| When Secretary Fox was here a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| for the federal funding for these highway projects and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| where does that stand in Congress now, or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| You know, it advances and then gets advanced in small increments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| They're looking for a large-scale or a long timeline approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Jeff is probably a little more familiar with where the funding issue stands, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1531)|
| 0:25:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1541)|
| 0:25:41| Jeff Welch with Knoxville Regional TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| Congress passed an extension through the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| And for the highway transportation bill, the Senate has passed a six-year bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| but it only has funding for three years in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| So there's really no long-term commitment yet at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| The dollars that we've been talking about here tonight are committed to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| They're available already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| And just to add to what John indicated with the approximately $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| that the city of Knoxville received from TDOT for this congestion mitigation quality grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| that's specifically for Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| So that $2 million will be going for improvements along Chapman Highway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| for signalization upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| So there's additional, there's $7 million for key corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| but there's $2 million that the city made applications for CMAQ funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| and that money is available right now also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| You're going to test this system on Cumberland Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| The one thing that a intelligent transportation system cannot do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1613)|
| 0:27:05| where you're totally over capacity, make things run well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| I mean, you know, where it'll help is as roads approach capacity and start to break down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1629)|
| 0:27:17| it'll keep the traffic moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| So you shift traffic around, is that what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| If you see congestion in one area, you try to route it by...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| No, no, that's more like what the state does with their SmartWay program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| Basically, what this system does is look for the change in vehicular trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| and make changes to the signal timing to try to accommodate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| They get a longer green light if there's congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Right, you know, they may take some time away from the side streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| and give it to the main street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| It may improve flow in one direction over the other direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| things of that nature to keep the congestion from building up too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| I guess, is there an example in the city where we've got a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| that you think this program will help with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| And what's our system doing now that once we have this new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| how will it alleviate that problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Is there an example that comes to mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Yeah, well, you know, I think anywhere where you're currently running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| coordinated traffic flow today...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Where would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Well, pretty much all up and down Kingston Pike, Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Western Avenue, you know, probably about 60 to 70 percent of the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| have some form of signal progression on them already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| Like I say, they are developed by models from historical traffic data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| hoping that it projects what you'll be seeing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| And what the system does is instead of just totally relying on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| historical projections to try to optimize those flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| it'll look at what's actually occurring on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and maybe select more appropriate patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| or maybe even adjust those patterns somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| to accommodate conditions that are slightly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| than the model that put those progression timings in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| to begin with had projected would be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1775)|
| 0:29:35| So real-time adjustment is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Yeah, it takes it to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| And basically, it should have some marginal effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| on some additional improvement on all of your corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| whether they currently have progression today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Is there an override if it goes kerfluey sometimes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Is there an override where human beings can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| well, it's not working for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Let's put in some criteria that we want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| while we're working on the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Yeah, well, I think what the city does today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| is they update their patterns as frequently as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| There are abilities to manually override.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| There's very little ability to do that on the fly, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| Basically, they would go in, develop new patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| download them into the systems, refine them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| and a few weeks later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| the improved timing patterns are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| This is going to greatly enhance and facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| the real-time adjustments to the flows on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1850)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Can you estimate how much more efficient this system will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| Then, I mean, will it be able to carry more capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| on the same roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Or is there a way to, I guess, to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| kind of quantify it down to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| That's one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| And I guess the other question I had was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| you know, when we started out with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| did we set a preliminary budget to what it was going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Or did we just say, let's just have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| I mean, I don't know how we got to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| How did we get to $7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And apparently, that's not all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| So, Ryan, explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| I think the study that I mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| that was finished approximately a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| you know, looked and projected the full cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| the full build-out of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| what it will take and what it will cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| One of the things to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| while I focused on the enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| and the improvements to the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| the more modern, robust system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| than what you have in place today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| another thing to keep in mind is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| you know, I mentioned earlier that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| you know, had almost 88% of their field hardware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1927)|
| 0:32:16| beyond its life cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| which was meaning the city was facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| having to replace almost all of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| signal control equipment at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| One of the things that this system is allowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| as we've gone in and modernized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| or added the additional features and capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| it's also allowed the city to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| and do some of their life cycle replacements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| that they were facing very huge hits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| with all local funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| And now they're being able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| to fold a number of those into this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| And so life cycle replacement is one area that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| aside from the additional capabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| that this program is going to greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| you know, assist the city from a cash standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| But there's no quantitative number to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| we're really thinking you can have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| with this robust system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| we will be able to have 30% more capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| with the same amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| with the same road widths and roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| I can tell you, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| there is some benefit cost information out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| that's been gathered over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| It was pretty well quantified back in the era| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| where there was no progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| For example, going from uncoordinated signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| to providing coordinated signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| would typically improve delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| by about 40% or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| Y'all have gotten to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| where you've got some base coordination in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| It may not be the most efficient timings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| and you may not be able to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| to adjust them to fluctuating conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| but you've got some level of progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| By going in and taking this to the next level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| is it going to squeeze another 40% improvement out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| It's going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| more in the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| I would have to quote you numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| off of the top of my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| that I'm not totally familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| but I would expect it to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| in the 10 to 15% improvement to delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| The one thing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| and it's also true with the freeway management systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| the greatest of the frustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| in our networks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| whether it be the freeways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| or whether it be the arterials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| is related to sporadic events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| traffic accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| things that cause the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| to break down for a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| and it takes it a very long time to recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| and the frustration level to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| during that period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| is where you get your most complaints, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| The one thing that this system does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| that the old system had no real capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| to enhance recovery from those types of incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| you know, one of the great advantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| of this type of a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| is accommodating those breakdown of conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| the very worst congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| hopefully prevent some of that buildup from occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| and also allow you to dissipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| when it does occur much more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| than you did in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| And so what it will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| is take the edge off your worst events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| In particular, your performance in those periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| will probably be pretty substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| but day in, day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| over the entire day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| you know, the marginal improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| will probably be more 10 to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| So really we have an aging system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| that almost 90% of it is life-cycled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| and this opportunity by redesigning it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| over the whole city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| gives us a chance to leverage federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| to replace equipment that's in of its life anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Let's move along to Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| So in your project status and schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| you're going to do with this $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| the entire planning for all phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| How many phases are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Number one, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| It would probably be two to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| depending on what the next bite of the apple tends to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| So you do all your planning up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| and that's part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Well, it's more than just the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| We will do like the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| And the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| And set up the initial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| the traffic operation center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| the servers, the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| the communication equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| will be set up to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| the full build out of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| so that you're not having to reinvent that component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| And then what you will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| is just add additional intersections over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| We will get as many intersections as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| in the initial project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| in addition to the traffic operation center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| and the servers and the software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| and the core ingredients of the full system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| We'll be going in as part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| but we'll be bringing on additional corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| So does that suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| that we're going to try to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| all the corridors at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| and just go out from the center perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| until we run out of money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| No, we will be prioritizing corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| and we'll be selecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| which ones can be done in the initial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| There is some constructability elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| You're building a communications network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| to accommodate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| and so you can't exactly go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| and do 10 intersections over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| 10 intersections over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| and 10 intersections over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| and bring all the communications back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| to the centralized location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| because some of these communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| will likely be hardwired communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| whether it be fiber or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| So the $2 million CMAQ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| is that going to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| the same thing along Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2336)|
| 0:38:56| That's going to do the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| we're doing in the initial project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| but it's only specifically targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| It can only be targeted to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| It's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| that if we keep traffic moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| this will reduce the idling time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| and improve the air quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| so that as the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| adjusts the standards again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| this will help bring us into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| probably better compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| with those new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2369)|
| 0:39:29| And that's how they were able to win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| that what I refer to as the CMAQ funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| is congestion mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| It's based on air quality improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| and basically the models have projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| the level of improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| that comes from this program implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| does improve air quality sufficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| that they chose to fund this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| over other programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| that have requested that same funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| I want to ask you a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| about the closed circuit cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| Under this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| will there be more cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| placed more strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| than we presently have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| or tell me a little bit more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Would you get a ticket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2417)|
| 0:40:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| No, I did get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| One of the things I would like to qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| when you look at the state's system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| on the freeways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| it's based on surveillance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| They've got operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| that constantly monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| and manually make adjustments all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| and so video is a critical component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| to the freeway management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| On the arterial system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| it's more automated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| but what you typically see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| is that strategic locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| where congestion would tend to rise up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| the most critical locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| within your corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| you probably want to supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| some video at those locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| so your traffic engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| at the operation center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| can visualize what the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| is telling them is occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| and have a confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| of the adjustments that are being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| But it'll be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| and it'll be more strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| and it'll probably be more at key intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| not just complete coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| like you see on the interstate system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Another question I had about the transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| with the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| we're trying to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| more people to use public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| so with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| I think you mentioned in your presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| it would help with buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| in terms of own time performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| that would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| under this system so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| If that element is fully incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| I mentioned that's one of the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| that are beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| it's a relatively new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| element that has begun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| to be incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| in these types of systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| and is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| that we'll be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| and possibly implementing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| Each of these feature areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| require a certain level of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| over the core investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| and as we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| where to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| the funds that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| it'll be one of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| that will be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| That's part of what the stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| meeting is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| and there will be also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| some planning meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| before we go into hard design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| We've not been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| the final design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| configurations at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| but that is an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| that has begun to emerge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| and that can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| to enhance the performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| of the bus fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| if that is accommodated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Another question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| you just mentioned the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Does that include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| community organizations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Is there other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| you named a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| kind of major stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| but does that include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| just the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| from the general public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| No, the stakeholder groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| are primarily the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| transportation entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| transportation related entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| We're trying to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| the linkages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| between the city's ATMS program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| and the other investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| in intelligent transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| that's being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| and where we can provide linkages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| between those various programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2623)|
| 0:43:43| Very briefly and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| I meant to ask this a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Does this mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| with the communications systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| more overhead lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| or can we use some existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| overhead lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2636)|
| 0:43:56| all over this city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Well, will there be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| some additional overhead lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| You know, there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| like I say, there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| existing interconnect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| that's out there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Some of it may not be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| to be reused as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| but we would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| to say lash the new cable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| to the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| that are already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| It wouldn't create new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| pole lines within those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| But yes, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| there would be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| additional new lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| added in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| No further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| All right, no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Jim, anything else from you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| I don't have anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| If there's no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I don't see one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| I can just thank everybody for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Well, what action will we be asked to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| I know that, but when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| When's this going to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| I guess the next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| you all will see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| will probably be some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| well, some, there'll be purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| of hardware that you'll probably be voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| and some construction contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| I mean, anything else of that sort of scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Consulting agreement for the CMAQ part, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| You'll also see a consultant contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| for the CMAQ part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Other than that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| there'll be probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| several different vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| who will have contracts to supply hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| So you'll be seeing little pieces of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| every once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| But I'm also assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| that the public will be asking you questions too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Can a nine-year-old kid hack the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| and make the traffic go crazy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Probably not a nine-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| There is a lot of security in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| and that is a genuine concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| But I mean, somebody hacked a car recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| and made it, put its brakes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| And there is a genuine security concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| with these systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| and there is serious design effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| to avoid any kind of hacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| All right, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150813?start=2795)|
