|   197    |   204    | At the time of installation, we said if just one life was saved from this box, it would be worth it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=197.0)              |
|   204    |   212    | And I can tell you when I got the phone call about this, it was a relief to know this resource was in our city and likely saved this baby's life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=204.0)              |
|   212    |   219    | So again, the baby box is designed to be an anonymous surrender for any parent who needs a place to turn in a time of crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=212.0)              |

|   301    |   308    | Jeff, this is your, I believe, your last council meeting as director of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Department.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=301.0)              |

|   314    |   325    | And in addition to your 35 years in various roles as executive director of TPO and then stepping into executive director of the whole department, you've done tremendous work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=314.0)              |

|   330    |   334    | So please join me in thanking Jeff Welch for his service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=330.0)              |
|   334    |   350    | And a quick reminder for those who wish to speak, either to a specific agenda item or during public forum, should sign up with Mr. Johnson, our city recorder, ahead of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=334.0)              |
|   350    |   356    | And council rules state that up to three people each may speak for or against an agenda item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=350.0)              |
|   356    |   362    | And right now, many more than three people have signed up for item 11C.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=356.0)              |
|   362    |   375    | So I would ask the various people who signed up to consider huddling in the back of the room and confirm which three speakers you would like to prioritize on this topic before we get to that item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=362.0)              |

|   544    |   557    | Mr. Brace, we had had some conversations about some concerns about staffing funding for the building department and some of the delays in processing because huge work volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=544.0)              |
|   558    |   568    | And there's some staffing and there's some recommendations from the consultants to staff up a little bit larger than what's proposed in the budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=558.0)              |
|   568    |   575    | So let me just talk about that and what is and isn't being addressed in this budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=568.0)              |

|   577    |   579    | I mean, I'll just give you a brief overview.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=577.0)              |
|   579    |   585    | This budget does include two new positions and council approved another new position during a budget amendment in the spring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=579.0)              |
|   585    |   587    | So we've added a total.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=585.0)              |
|   587    |   590    | If you approve this tonight, it'll add three new positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=587.0)              |

|   607    |   609    | People want to invest in our city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=607.0)              |
|   609    |   616    | And that backlog, we're going to need to we're going to hire an outside entity to help us address that backlog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=609.0)              |
|   616    |   627    | So with the new positions, with the outside help, and the automation, which in theory should make things easier for our customers, we're going to wait and then in six months reevaluate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=616.0)              |
|   627    |   641    | And if we still believe at that time we need more permanent positions added to the city staff to address these permits, then we'll evaluate that and bring a proposal to council middle of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=627.0)              |

|   654    |   655    | This is a kind of twofold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=654.0)              |
|   655    |   662    | One is to better connect our neighborhood codes enforcement officers with the managers and foreman that are out in the neighborhoods every day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=655.0)              |
|   662    |   668    | But it's also to allow Mr. Aaron's and his team time to strictly focus on new investments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=662.0)              |

|   734    |   748    | And thank you to my colleagues for allowing an extension, allowing a postponement for the second vote so that we could have a little bit more time to ask questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=734.0)              |
|   748    |   756    | I appreciated that time and was able to develop some clarity around a few issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=748.0)              |
|   756    |   762    | Definitely not all issues represented in the budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=756.0)              |
|   762    |   774    | But still had some pretty significant concerns that I've been able to express to the administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=762.0)              |
|   775    |   791    | One of those is the level of investment that we're seeing in our housing versus other parts of our budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=775.0)              |
|   791    |   800    | We've been able to increase the level of funding going towards housing with some federal dollars that have come available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=791.0)              |
|   801    |   806    | And so now we're seeing those budget numbers decrease in our budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=801.0)              |

|  1081    |  1086    | And I think what the Mayor had discussed previously was we could add 20 right now,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1081.0)             |
|  1086    |  1091    | but by the time those individuals get on board, get trained and up to speed, it doesn't help our backlog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1086.0)             |
|  1091    |  1098    | So what we have in the interim is a contract right now, a small contract with Canaan & Canaan to help with those reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1091.0)             |
|  1098    |  1104    | We will be bringing City Council a larger contract to go ahead and try to get the backlog work through,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1098.0)             |
|  1104    |  1109    | get these individuals hired, trained, and then we'll reevaluate and see where we are at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1104.0)             |
|  1109    |  1121    | So I think this housing urgency that both Councilwoman Bryder and Parker were talking about is our number one concern in Knoxville right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1109.0)             |
|  1121    |  1129    | By the time we would have trained and had six other members working, I think right now we're just playing catch-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1121.0)             |
|  1129    |  1132    | This is going to continue. This isn't going to end any time soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1129.0)             |
|  1132    |  1139    | And it's time for kind of throwing everything in. Yes, it's affordable housing, but it's also the middle housing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1132.0)             |
|  1139    |  1144    | And it's time for some radical solutions and to really focus our resources on this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1139.0)             |

|  1244    |  1249    | Yeah, well, I'd say a lot of it is the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1244.0)             |
|  1249    |  1252    | I agree.

|  1252    |  1255    | This is a free market, and we cannot control that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1252.0)             |
|  1255    |  1260    | But, yeah, I'm just very concerned what our part is and what we can do differently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1255.0)             |

|  1264    |  1270    | I just want to say that I agree with what my colleagues have been talking about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1264.0)             |
|  1270    |  1278    | This is kind of an extension of a conversation that we had in our legislative budget hearings that really is dealing with affordability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1270.0)             |
|  1278    |  1283    | And what you're hearing is the effects of supply and demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1278.0)             |
|  1283    |  1291    | If I remember correctly, I think Plans Review had two positions that they were asking to be filled that hadn't been.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1283.0)             |
|  1291    |  1299    | And I'm very encouraged to hear about looking at the backlog because obviously we need to deal with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1291.0)             |
|  1299    |  1305    | I think we also need to look at whether or not we need a budget amendment to add those two additional folks with Plans Review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1299.0)             |
|  1306    |  1316    | I think what was being said is that we do a really good job with public-private partnerships to encourage housing, and we need to continue to do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1306.0)             |
|  1316    |  1319    | There's a limit to how much we can actually accomplish there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1316.0)             |
|  1319    |  1330    | The bigger piece of this is encouraging the private sector to do this because we just can't do enough supply ourselves on our own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1319.0)             |
|  1330    |  1336    | So we need to address that by dealing with the backlog and then decreasing the time that people are dealing with permits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1330.0)             |
|  1336    |  1347    | and using some of our tools to encourage mixed use along the corridors where we have a lot of access to transportation and other amenities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1336.0)             |
|  1347    |  1354    | that we can then use to continue to build the housing that we really desperately need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1347.0)             |

|  1427    |  1429    | Is that correct?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1427.0)             |

|  1432    |  1433    | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1432.0)             |
|  1434    |  1441    | It's commonly called higher lag vacancies because we budget for spaces, not faces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1434.0)             |
|  1441    |  1453    | If you have that, by the time overtime is applied against it and any other shortfalls that you might have had, anything that is extra goes into unassigned fund balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1441.0)             |
|  1453    |  1454    | That is correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1453.0)             |
|  1454    |  1458    | And anything that's extra within that budget rolls into those applicable departments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1454.0)             |
|  1458    |  1462    | Is that right, before the unassigned fund balance?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1458.0)             |

|  1480    |  1483    | I do realize we raise taxes, property taxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1480.0)             |
|  1483    |  1486    | We still have very low property taxes, but we raise those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1483.0)             |
|  1486    |  1491    | And in an effort to avoid doing that for as long as we can, there is some savings here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1486.0)             |

|  1534    |  1545    | And we had for the vacancies that existed at that time, and those go up and down daily because people are always being hired, people are always leaving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1534.0)             |

|  1550    |  1562    | Well, the projected overtime, annualized overtime in excess of the budget for the entirety of the FY would be $5.2 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1550.0)             |
|  1562    |  1575    | So you track $9.867, $5.213, and then you've got to take out the delta from the projected, in other words, revenues less expenses,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1562.0)             |
|  1575    |  1582    | and that's about $3.915 million due to higher than normal operating costs due to inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1575.0)             |
|  1582    |  1594    | And you're left with around $738K projected operating balance just in that area for FY23, and that does roll into unassigned fund balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1582.0)             |
|  1594    |  1595    | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1594.0)             |
|  1595    |  1608    | So my only point is that vacancy savings dollars that is not spent on personnel rose into each departmental budget for whatever projects are remaining for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1595.0)             |
|  1608    |  1612    | So we spend that excess personnel budget at the end of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1608.0)             |
|  1612    |  1623    | And so what I'm saying is that's fine, but we shouldn't be using unassigned fund balance in the near future if that's the case because I want to prevent having to raise taxes as long as we can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1612.0)             |

|  1630    |  1635    | Yeah, and I'm referring to the operating budget, not the unassigned fund balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1630.0)             |

|  1637    |  1645    | But I'm just going to put out there that we spend unused dollars that we do not spend on employees that are unhired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1637.0)             |
|  1645    |  1648    | We spend that on other projects in the operating budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1645.0)             |
|  1648    |  1653    | And what I'm saying is we should be very careful and try to save that when possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1648.0)             |

|  1657    |  1660    | I think that's not exactly my understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1657.0)             |
|  1660    |  1662    | It is a little different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1660.0)             |
|  1663    |  1677    | I just wanted to point out, though, that the whole point of raising taxes was to address shortcomings where we had high-level vacancies in public service, high-level vacancies in finance and police and some in fire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1663.0)             |
|  1677    |  1683    | And to a great extent, those raises have been effective in filling out our ranks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1677.0)             |
|  1683    |  1692    | And so our department directors do not want our chiefs and our directors want to fill their ranks and in many cases want more people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=1683.0)             |

|  3991.08 |  3993.08 | I've worked in harm reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3991.08)            |
|  3993.08 |  4015.08 | And during that time, I've built relationships with lots of organizations and, more importantly, lots of people living in our community who have been deeply impacted by houselessness, by the ongoing housing crisis, the ongoing overdose crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=3993.08)            |
|  4015.08 |  4021.08 | And one thing that I realized over that time is that we need more tools in our toolbox.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4015.08)            |
|  4022.08 |  4035.08 | And I think that alternative response is a really essential tool that we could easily add and that supporting 11C would give the opportunity to figure out what that could look like in our community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4022.08)            |
|  4036.08 |  4051.08 | One example that is really close to my heart and the work that I have done over the past six years is thinking about the ways that the overdose crisis has impacted our community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4036.08)            |
|  4052.08 |  4061.08 | I know from the work that I do that the vast majority of people who respond to overdose are not police officers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4052.08)            |
|  4062.08 |  4066.08 | It's people who are in community with other folks who use drugs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4062.08)            |
|  4066.08 |  4073.08 | They're reversing overdoses of loved ones, of friends, of the people that they really care about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4066.08)            |
|  4073.08 |  4083.08 | And that is something that's deeply, deeply traumatic, both for the person who is overdosing and for the person who is reversing that overdose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4073.08)            |
|  4084.08 |  4109.08 | And so many of those people, after the overdose is reversed, choose not to seek emergency services out of fear that the person who reversed the overdose or the person who was overdosing or anyone who's present is going to be arrested for something like paraphernalia charges or a warrant or something like that.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4084.08)            |
|  4109.08 |  4118.08 | And we all know that arrest is not going to make the life of someone who just effectively died and came back better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4109.08)            |
|  4119.08 |  4133.08 | But what if we imagine a world where someone can come and help them process that trauma and help them make sure that they're physically OK and get them the support that they need?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4119.08)            |
|  4134.08 |  4144.08 | I think that's the world I want to live in, and I think we have a really easy tool that we can employ to make that happen for Knoxville.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4134.08)            |

|  4416.08 |  4419.08 | You have a lot of brilliant, really experienced people here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4416.08)            |
|  4420.08 |  4427.08 | I don't believe the resolution actually names who will be on the task force, but again, I encourage you to look for the folks in this room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4420.08)            |
|  4428.08 |  4432.08 | You have the data. They know the data. They know how this can happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4428.08)            |
|  4433.08 |  4439.08 | I think what I really want to stress is that when, hopefully when, you pass this resolution and create this task force,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4433.08)            |
|  4440.08 |  4445.08 | and once eight months is up and they have a recommendation to implement a pilot program, you actually do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4440.08)            |

|  4449.08 |  4453.08 | People are suffering because we don't have this model. It's worked elsewhere. It can work here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4449.08)            |
|  4454.08 |  4461.08 | So again, I just encourage you to pass this resolution and eight months down the road to actually implement what the team develops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=4454.08)            |

|  5265.88 |  5272.28 | Thank you, Mayor, and thank you so much for the community who showed up tonight, who have                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5265.88)            |
|  5272.28 |  5277.64 | been working hard on this issue, who signed up for public forum. We are here tonight discussing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5272.280000000001)  |
|  5277.64 |  5281.84 | this issue because of all the work that you have done. So I just want to say thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5277.64)            |
|  5281.84 |  5289.68 | quickly to the mayor and my colleagues. I wanted to begin today's discussion a little                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5281.84)            |
|  5289.68 |  5297.48 | bit different than we had in the past because I know members of council have been having                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5289.68)            |
|  5297.48 |  5304.92 | conversations with members of the community about this topic, and I'm quite excited about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5297.4800000000005) |
|  5304.92 |  5313.04 | where we are in that conversation. I believe there's a lot of support for this resolution,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5304.92)            |
|  5313.04 |  5319.8  | but I also believe there may be need for more time for council members to gain, to grow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5313.04)            |
|  5319.8  |  5326.72 | in their understanding of what exactly is being proposed. So I wanted to hear from council                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5319.8)             |

I can start off briefly by introducing the topic and stating my reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5326.72)            |
|  5336.24 |  5341.72 | for wanting to bring the resolution. I think many of you all are aware that members of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5336.240000000001)  |

|  5349.68 |  5355.76 | issues that they felt needed more attention from city government, more attention in our                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5349.68)            |

|  5726.68 |  5731.56 | Is this something that could work in Knoxville if we found a local partner who's willing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=5726.68)            |

|  5745.72 |  5751.76 | you've seen? So I'll hit on some of the themes that we've seen to make them successful.

|  6398.08 |  6404.72 | so I appreciate that. When I spoke with a member from HART, my reservation was about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6398.08)            |
|  6404.72 |  6412.52 | the $500,000 that was in the resolution. The number that actually made it to the agenda                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6404.72)            |
|  6412.52 |  6420.56 | is a different number. So my questions to Ms. Riffwald, I believe, were what is the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6412.52)            |
|  6420.56 |  6427.76 | $500,000? Like what is the budget? There was no budget to that, and so that was the hesitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=6420.56)            |

|  7072.64 |  7079.64 | Yeah, so my question a while ago to the administration wasn't precisely exactly what empath was,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7072.64)            |
|  7079.64 |  7086.64 | it was, so the question here is who houses the alternative response team? And that's                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7079.64)            |
|  7086.64 |  7094.64 | the question that Hart has been asking.

|  7094.64 |  7102.64 | it belongs, or, you know, an alternative response. So my question is, is the alternative response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7094.64)            |
|  7102.64 |  7111.64 | team, is that something that can be housed with the empath offered and managed through                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7102.64)            |

|  7113.64 |  7118.64 | I would just say that McNabb has been part of these discussions for several years, and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7113.64)            |

|  7160.64 |  7165.64 | you know, do a better job providing those services in person, not just on the phone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7160.64)            |
|  7165.64 |  7170.64 | and not just during business hours and so forth. So, again, I think that this is really                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7165.64)            |
|  7170.64 |  7175.64 | important. I think the city can play a role, but just like empath, which we started, you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7170.64)            |
|  7175.64 |  7181.64 | know, empath and the BHUC and street outreach workers, all these things that the council                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7175.64)            |
|  7181.64 |  7186.64 | has pushed for and supported that we did, you know, we didn't, we moved forward on those                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7181.64)            |
|  7186.64 |  7191.64 | just as a council, because we heard input from the community, they didn't need a task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7186.64)            |
|  7191.64 |  7198.64 | force. And so, so these, this is the state responsibility, and we, I agree with Councilmember                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7191.64)            |

If you've got a task force that's formed, um, whether                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7534.64)            |
|  7540.64 |  7545.64 | it's a committee, a board, task force, whatever, it's got to have structure. So I'm just curious                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7540.64)            |

|  7631.64 |  7635.64 | you would support because the makeup of the task force would come right back before city                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7631.64)            |

|  7654.64 |  7660.64 | Thank you for that.

|  7660.64 |  7666.64 | and having some of those things already thought out and fleshed out, um, as to what it looks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7660.64)            |
|  7666.64 |  7675.64 | like, just even a rough draft, if you will.

|  7675.64 |  7681.64 | idea, but I guess I'm just looking for more details on, on what's been thought through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7675.64)            |
|  7682.64 |  7688.64 | Well, and just quickly, I guess the rough draft would be the description in our packet,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7682.64)            |
|  7688.64 |  7696.64 | um, you know, that states the type of members that we envision would be a part of the task                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7688.64)            |

So I just want to reflect a little bit about                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7733.64)            |
|  7738.64 |  7745.64 | what I've heard. Um, I want to, first of all, thank HART for bringing this model to, to,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7738.64)            |
|  7745.64 |  7753.64 | to me years ago, and, um, you all brought educated, rational, programmatic ideas for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7745.64)            |
|  7753.64 |  7758.64 | this program. And I think what I've witnessed is over the course of a couple of years, we've                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7753.64)            |
|  7758.64 |  7764.64 | moved from a little uncertainty to general consensus that this program needs to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7758.64)            |
|  7765.64 |  7775.64 | I've also heard that funding's not an issue, uh, in terms of next steps. So while it may                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7765.64)            |
|  7775.64 |  7780.64 | cost, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars to stand up, there's not a funding gap for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7775.64)            |
|  7780.64 |  7790.64 | researching or meeting with HART, McNab and the administration. So in my opinion, council                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7780.64)            |
|  7790.64 |  7795.64 | was not needed to take the next step. Um, we don't need to be involved and necessarily                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7790.64)            |
|  7795.64 |  7800.64 | read ourselves into the play. We have, McNab has been doing this for two years. They've                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7795.64)            |
|  7800.64 |  7807.64 | learned a lot. HART has not stopped researching what they found. What I've also heard is somewhere                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=7800.64)            |

|  8214.64 |  8220.64 | work is a legitimate question, because I think the reason, as Councilman Thomas just pointed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8214.64)            |

|  8364.64 |  8369.64 | But I think, and also, you know, from council members and the administration, I've heard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8364.64)            |
|  8369.64 |  8375.64 | a lot of positivity, but also a lot of question. And so if there is a lot of positivity and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8369.64)            |
|  8375.64 |  8380.64 | a lot of questions, my hope would be that the task force provides a space to help create                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8375.64)            |
|  8380.64 |  8386.64 | some clarity, whereas we, you know, we spent another hour again trying to get some clarity,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8380.64)            |
|  8386.64 |  8391.64 | and we're just not going to get clarity in this space. There's too many answers to, too                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8386.64)            |
|  8391.64 |  8396.64 | many questions to answer, too many reports to make sure we've all read and we're all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8391.64)            |
|  8396.64 |  8402.64 | on the same page on. So that's really why I'm pushing for the task force, not because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8396.64)            |
|  8402.64 |  8407.64 | I think it will force an outcome, but really because I think it will create space.

Just to address the first part, you'd mentioned, you know, the big question that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8696.64)            |
|  8700.64 |  8704.64 | I hear from a lot of city council members, which I think is very legitimate, is where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8700.64)            |
|  8704.64 |  8709.64 | do these people go when we go to the calls? And I think what's missing on that question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8704.64)            |
|  8709.64 |  8715.64 | is just the concept of de-escalation. For a lot of these folks, they're not willing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8709.64)            |
|  8715.64 |  8720.64 | to go to services. Maybe they've had a really bad experience with getting mental health                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8715.64)            |
|  8720.64 |  8725.64 | services, but there is a way to de-escalate them and prevent harm from a police officer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8720.64)            |
|  8725.64 |  8730.64 | showing up on the scene. So it's not necessarily, you know, let's go fix this person's life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8725.64)            |

|  8735.64 |  8741.64 | which might be just stabilizing them on the scene, creating a relationship with them where                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8735.64)            |

|  8854.64 |  8858.64 | because it has a police officer in there, they're still seeing hundreds of folks.

|  8858.64 |  8866.64 | so there's got to be some things that can be learned that would inspire or inform your                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8858.64)            |
|  8866.64 |  8872.64 | program, because I think it's very important when you ask to be heard to also listen, because                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8866.64)            |
|  8872.64 |  8877.64 | the existing provider doesn't agree with all the things that you're going to recommend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=8872.64)            |
|  8877.64 |  8884.64 | So I think this is part of the challenge.

There was a word that Councilmember Thomas said just a little bit ago when he                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230530?start=9085.64)            |
|  9091.64 |  9097.64 | was discussing this, and he said the word unity.

|  9104.64 |  9109.64 | very clear that some amendments are going to have to be made in order to do that.
