| 2:23:30| it shows where one of these pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| is lit up to form exactly the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| I just read to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| These are also similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| to some photos you received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| in a letter from Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| that is dated August the 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| and your attention is called specifically to the sonic signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| that are in that packet and to the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| Wholesale Furniture sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| The difference in the billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| that Lamar wanted to convert to this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| is they can have 672 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| on that billboard if you allow that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| and the on-premise signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| such as Sonic and Knoxville Wholesale Furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| are restricted to a much lesser square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| At the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| as I said, they did vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| to uphold the city's interpretation that these signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| do meet the definition of an electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| and based on the facts that as I presented them tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| we still are under that opinion and we ask you to deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8676)|
| 2:24:44| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Council Member Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| I'm prepared to make a motion unless someone wants to say something beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| Council Member Roddy's light is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| Mrs. Cash, just to clarify for myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| the Appendix B Zoning Regulations definitions were included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| in our packet and the definition that you read to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| the definition of an electronic message center sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| does not make any mention of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| location being on-premise or off-premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| Is that correct? That is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| I want to make sure I'm clear here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| I was trying to watch for lights and not listen very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| So are we saying now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| our interpretation is our definition of electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| now is one that would be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| or can be applied to digital display billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| Is that what I'm hearing? Did I hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8738)|
| 2:25:44| Are they now considered by us and our definition as one and the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| Interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| Council Member Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| Me, Mr. Vice Mayor? Yes, Council Member Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| I always want to support the city and its interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| although as I've talked to Scenic Knoxville on a number of occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| I think that there is room for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| continued discussion and potential compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| because there are areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| within the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| that in my view are not scenic and never will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| and if you want to clean it up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| you might even consider these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| I think these are very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| to businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| who want to advertise in certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| where along lines of 40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| and Kingston Pike through those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| I know there's lots of legal experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| that have said that a deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| where you take down four or five or six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| in order to put one of these up is illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| you can't do it, there's property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| but I really feel like if there was some effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| among not only Lamar but all the advertising agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| to come together as an association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| and to look at all the different billboards that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| which I don't think anybody thinks are beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| or scenic or nice or anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| but signs are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| and I just would hope that we don't have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| on the right without any interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| in discussing or compromising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| and people on the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| that this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| couldn't be worked out in some sort of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| that our area, Knoxville, which is greatest asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| is our natural assets and that's our views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| and all the things we have around here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| the mountains and streams and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| I think tonight I want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| what my other colleagues have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| but it puts me in a predicament because we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| a lot of discussions like that that are going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| and we may get something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| an unintended consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| but I want to support the city and its interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| Council Member Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| Thank you. I sure hope I didn't mishear my friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| Councilman Bailey talking about some parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| are unattractive, I mean beauty is in the eye of the beholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| and people who choose to live where they choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| do so for many reasons, what's beautiful to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| might not be beautiful to us and vice versa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| but having said that, I've reviewed all of the material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| presented to us and I believe the city's building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| official is correct in the interpretation of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| and therefore I move to deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| Moved and probably seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8930)|
| 2:28:53| Council Member Pilo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| I just want to comment, I have a funny take on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| Councilman Bailey said and I tend to agree with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| because in my district there's some very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| a lot of not beautiful areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| and they happen to be some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| best retail and commercial areas but they are, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| littered with many kinds of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| and I believe that's what the councilman was referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| he and I both kind of traversed that area a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| and I don't need to speak for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| that was what was in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| you know, this real problem for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| to make a decision on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| because as I said the other evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| when we were considering the electronic message boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| my concern about denying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| or putting more term on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| whatever, being selective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| about where they can appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| is not a level playing field for all businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| that really bothers me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8996)|
| 2:29:59| I don't think businesses should be favored in one part of town over the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| I think there are many businesses that really rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| from a distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9008)|
| 2:30:11| it disturbs me that we have come to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| in this very frustrating issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| where we've got to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| one position or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| because frankly I'm a person who believes in regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| and I think that's been our one saving grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| is that we could regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| and it's just been my belief from the get go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| that this issue is going to take us to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| and given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| I've mentioned this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| but given the state's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| on the digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| I think if we lose the ability to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| we may very possibly lose the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| to have any say so in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| and I frankly think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| the work of that task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| was very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| and reached a very sensible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| and a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| a compromise that I can be comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| simply because I felt that the industry gave a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| that the city also recognized the rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| of the property owners and the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| and I called on Ms. Cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| because I really want to support the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| but I too feel that we may be getting ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| where Knoxville has given up the opportunity to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| and we let a court decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| I'm not big on Nashville deciding things for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| I'm not big on letting courts decide things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| that we can and I believe should work out reasonably here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| for ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| so I could toss a coin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| on how I'm going to vote and it probably won't matter anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| but I just need to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9125)|
| 2:32:08| it's a very difficult issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| I could debate myself on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| but I want to be fair to businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| that I think rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| we talk about safety, we talk about a whole lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| and it's kind of like the Fort Sanders issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| about value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| to me it's not safe to be driving through a town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| I'm not familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9152)|
| 2:32:35| there's some place that I need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| and I don't have anything to direct me there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| so I can see that tourists who visit this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| for the beauty and for many of the wonderful amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| that we have in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| can also be needing to find out where they're going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| their little heads that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9173)|
| 2:32:56| and not have an 18-wheeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| wipe them out on the side of the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| but I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| to Councilman Bailey that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| in our neighborhood, adjacent to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| we have ugly spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| and a lot of that is the letter of signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| and things that none of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| I think I stated one time, I'd never seen a billboard I liked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| and I have it, but they're there, they're going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| and so this just makes it tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| and I think we have to take a position on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9209)|
| 2:33:32| where I think we're giving up the opportunity to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| and make our own rules as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| Any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| comments or questions regarding the motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| Now before we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| Motion is to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| Yeah, motion is to deny. Before we vote I just wanted to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| the motion denied is not really one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| I think the Lamar gentleman may have spoken to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| how this is a separate issue from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| I think whether or not you have billboards or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| but really whether or not we're agreeing with this definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| and what the definition of city has placed into effect here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| and does it apply to these particular ones that are currently erected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| and what the issue is with regards to the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| the state of state law versus our local law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| I think there's a grouping of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9263)|
| 2:34:26| which gives me cause to pause here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9266)|
| 2:34:29| I think Council Member Pelos says it's not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| clear a slam dunk for me as whether or not you want billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| or whether or not you want EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9275)|
| 2:34:38| but a more complex legal question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| so whatever vote I cast tonight is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| looking towards that particular quagmire as opposed to the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| of whether or not I like EMCs or whether or not I like digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| or the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| and at this time all those in favor of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| to deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9296)|

| 2:36:50| we got an email which I actually missed originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| going through the increase in costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9413)|

| 2:37:02| I wanted to actually ask the question for you briefly just to say how the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| if you can do health increases, the open enrollment procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9425)|

| 2:37:11| Councilman Becker is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| what we're talking about tonight is the administrative contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| for the administering of our health care plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9437)|

| 2:37:26| that went out to you at the end of the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9446)|

| 2:37:32| for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| we have met with the employee association representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9455)|

| 2:40:53| he didn't sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9653)|

| 2:42:44| All those opposed have likewise right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| Now we're at that juncture where Council Member Becker made the motion earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| to move 11O up with 11J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| and then there was a question about which one we wished to take first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| and we have not resolved that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| so is there any, what's the pleasure of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| with regards to whether to take 11O or 11J first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9782)|

| 2:43:29| Mr. Ronnie Collins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| and he signed up for the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| The time sir is 9.59 you have up to 5 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| we thank you for coming and give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9818)|

| 2:43:44| I just want to say this is the conversation that needs to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| in developing privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| I ask the Council to support this and wait on the other issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| until MPC looks at the policy behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| I ask you to support this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| Thank you. Council Member Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| Thank you. You know we've been talking about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| Oh I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| Oh I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| Okay Mr. Blintner go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| Vice Mayor I think I also signed up to speak on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| Yeah 11-0 comma then there's a little J I thought you had put two commas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| Oh thank you I must admit though you've done a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| of presiding tonight so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| Thank you sir I appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| There may be those who disagree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| Jim Blintner 3819 Glenfield Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| I'll make my comments for both these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| at the same time so we'll try to get out of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| somehow tonight reasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| I've been working on this ordinance for parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| for a yard and on several other ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| and neighborhood groups and as we've moved forward through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| we've been very struck by the problem that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| I think sometimes we have problems with process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9896)|
| 2:44:59| as far as we're concerned and the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| that it flows from the Council to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| and back to Council and whether we get all the proper people included in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| and when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| been here for other things and this has been brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| we're also concerned about the process on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| I'd like to be in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| J I think we are in favor of that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| I think it speaks to the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| on O which we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| adversely affected by the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| I think when you have an arterial or collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9932)|
| 2:45:35| there are criteria that are set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| and those criteria shouldn't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| they either are or they aren't and it's not a matter of debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| it's something that's set up and it's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| so I think what makes sense here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| if it's appropriate to build those particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| buildings there and I'm not for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| or against that either way I'm against process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| then I think there are a couple of ways to do it one is to revise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| zoning ordinances to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| appropriate in that particular situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| or the second one is through a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| and again it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| disturbs me and several of us if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| we go ahead and approve O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| then in essence what we're doing is we're saying hey you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| we got a zoning regulation this is the way to get around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| let's just change this from an arterial to a collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| or vice versa or whatever or upgrade it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| and you know it seems to me that's not an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9992)|
| 2:46:35| that should be done lightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9995)|
| 2:46:38| I think it's just a bad precedent to set and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| ask that you approve J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| and perhaps O can be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| so it's not defeated or perhaps it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| defeated. Thank you. Thank you sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| Council Member Frost. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| Assuming nobody else has signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| you know we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| this issue like I was trying to say before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10022)|
| 2:47:05| before Mr. Blattner's kind words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| we've kind of tap danced around this issue to put it mildly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10028)|
| 2:47:11| clogged around it might be a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| description so I asked Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| I said let's try it we're talking policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| or we're talking project but it's really a project that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| change policy so I respectfully ask Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10043)|
| 2:47:26| to draw up something where the policy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| actually discussed I don't think of myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| as a policy wonk or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| but I think a policy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| appropriate it is appropriate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| we ask MPC to consider the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| situations and the criteria that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| is involved in determining the siting of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| self storage facilities you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| it's already described excuse me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| allowed in C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| zoned areas you know the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| supposedly was whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| it need to be on a major collector to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| neighborhoods well to be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| I'm not sure if there are many C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| zones that are in neighborhoods right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10094)|
| 2:48:17| or adjoining neighborhoods as this council well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| knows that a proper transition between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| residentially zoned area can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| neighborhood commercial or office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| so I think this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| as Mr. Collins said the conversation that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| needs to begin and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10115)|
| 2:48:38| that's why with the help of Mr. Swanson places on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| agenda thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10121)|
| 2:48:44| Councilmember Becker thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10124)|
| 2:48:47| I think at some level I think we could argue a lot about whether O is proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10127)|
| 2:48:50| and what the procedure was followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| and I want to go down a little bit of a different road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| because I think Mr. Frost is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| barking up a tree that makes some sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| now the challenge with the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| here is there are in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| 28 properties that are currently zoned C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| that are not on major collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| the concern about changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| designation of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10157)|
| 2:49:20| might possibly in the future be used to change something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| changing eliminating that requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| to be on major collectors immediately opens up 28 additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10166)|
| 2:49:29| pieces of property where you get by right the ability to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| self storage units and I have a problem with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| now I actually have a way I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10175)|
| 2:49:38| sort of change your resolution Mr. Frost to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| part of the issue we've had with this one is it's on this future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10181)|
| 2:49:44| major collector that there's a challenge that when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10184)|
| 2:49:47| road gets built it will be built to major collector standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| and when we got around to the next time of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10190)|
| 2:49:53| redoing the major road plan it'd be a major collector because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| that's the plan so one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| suggestion I've got Mr. Frost as an amendment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| let me also step back and I don't want to send a broad mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| to MPC on this I think we've done a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| of this with MPC of saying go study this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| and then it comes back and we don't like it and we say go study again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| and it takes a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| I'd like to get a little more concrete I believe there is a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| to say to them and Mr. Swanson and I have had a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| conversation about this I don't actually have language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| I have a concept that instead of saying go back and study this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10226)|
| 2:50:29| to go back and say we would like you to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| or we'd like you to study might be the proper way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10232)|
| 2:50:36| expanding it so that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| self storage unit can be on a major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| or a future major collector and I think we can define that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| by reference to the road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| map it's a way that would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| for this property and it would not open up those 28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| additional properties there is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| future major collector in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| and it pretty much is the entire section we're talking about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| so that's a minor thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| I'd also like to add something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| and again I think it fits with the spirit of what you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| interestingly you'd come to find out that while we do have all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| provisions that say in a C6 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| you have to be on a major collector as a way to keep them out of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10278)|
| 2:51:21| we actually don't say that in the I2 zone which unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| given some of the real old zoning we have in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| we got I2 zones that are in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| so I think I'd also like to add that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| your resolution to ask them to add the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| for the I2 zones that are next to neighborhoods as well as the C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| and I know there are other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| lights on as a concept I want to toss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| that out and I guess I'll make a motion after other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| have had their say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10308)|
| 2:51:51| Council Member Filo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| I believe that I have some sense of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| Council Member Becker is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| the thing that has been so interesting to me is that this street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| or this stub of this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10323)|
| 2:52:06| enters into a dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| path which is a future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| major collector if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| at the sector plan am I correct Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| and I think Mr. King and I have spoken about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| so in a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| this is not really a departure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| that we're doing something to favor somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| but it's simply that something has come along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10351)|
| 2:52:34| which begs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10354)|
| 2:52:37| be allowed to be developed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10357)|
| 2:52:40| which is probably the only thing in the world I can think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10360)|
| 2:52:43| that maybe you could put in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| on that property and I think it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| basically protects the property next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| simply because it will be lighted 24-7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10372)|
| 2:52:55| it actually to me would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| solve a lot of problems that are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| prevalent in that area that we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| don't even know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| it points out one of those things about sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10387)|
| 2:53:13| we don't pay enough attention to the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| when they're presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| we just have something there that seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| not to be an issue at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| and we don't even discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| I think this is a very important reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| to neighborhoods and areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10411)|
| 2:53:34| sector plans are critically important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| and I haven't seen any problem with approving the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10417)|
| 2:53:40| of this because it is on the designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| future major collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| I don't think anyone intends to build that road out today or tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10426)|
| 2:53:49| and this developer is willing to build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| to the end of his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| which will enable this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| but you pose an interesting possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| Councilman Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10441)|
| 2:54:04| so maybe that's the best resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| because I'm not really excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10447)|
| 2:54:10| sending more work for MPC to do and having to delay this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10450)|
| 2:54:13| the months that we wait to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10453)|
| 2:54:16| how they might work this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| so I'm just kind of thinking as I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| and I don't know how's the best way to resolve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10462)|
| 2:54:25| but I do think these sector plans are of a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10465)|
| 2:54:28| importance than we often put on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| because this right here is just a perfect example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| and for some reason some really bad information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| has gotten out to neighborhoods in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10477)|
| 2:54:41| for all these streets to become major collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| I don't know how in the world that thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| got in neighborhoods minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| but I have just had a myriad of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| emails from different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10493)|
| 2:54:56| who somehow have had this seed planted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| and they are on the other side of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10499)|
| 2:55:02| and don't really have any street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10502)|
| 2:55:05| or roadway that could possibly be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| so it really troubles me that bad information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| can get out and confuse an issue that we're trying to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| in another part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| just don't know where the bad information comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| and it's a little bit difficult to try to mediate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| Council Member Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| I'd like to respond to Councilman Becker's suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| which I realize were not in the form of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| but sounded like possible amendments to this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10533)|
| 2:55:36| and I understand the second half of your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| in terms of pulling in the industrial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| into this consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| I have a little bit of a problem with your first potential amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| and then it seems to me that we're prescribing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10548)|
| 2:55:51| the Metropolitan Planning Commission the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| and if we're asking them to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10554)|
| 2:55:57| then I think that they ought to have more latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| to look at all the data available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| and we want you to go study it and come up with this conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| Council Member Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| I would agree with Councilman Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| I think by you putting it on the table, Councilman Becker, at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| I would hope that Mr. Donaldson sitting right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| would hear that and say, okay, there's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| that we need to put on our list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| and any other council members that want to throw out ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| I think that's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| I think Mr. Donaldson took that very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| and put that on his list of things to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| and I see he now wants to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| I now have three bullet points on my list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| So, I just concur with Councilman Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| and I just want to clarify that we are still discussing 11J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| Is that correct, Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| That's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| Council Member Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| We sat here and MPC came with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| and we said, go consider it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| and they sent the exact same thing back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10623)|
| 2:57:06| I think we need to give them more direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| It seems to me like we have been spending a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| with this, sending stuff to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10632)|
| 2:57:15| asking them to consider all the facts and they come back with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| and we say, oh, we don't like it, so go consider it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| In the case of the accessory building, we rejected something and they sent it right back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10641)|
| 2:57:24| That's stupid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| We know what the answer we want is on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| There's no point in saying to MPC, go consider all the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| In the accessory buildings, we had made up our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10653)|
| 2:57:36| So, I think we should make up our minds on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| I think it gives clarity to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10659)|
| 2:57:42| and frankly, I don't know that we want them to spend a whole lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| studying all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| It's not that complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| I haven't made a motion yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| As soon as the lights about the process stop, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| I think we need to give MPC more direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| We will have less problem if we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10680)|
| 2:58:03| I have to agree with Councilman Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| I see nothing wrong with Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| as we have in the past, making strong recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10689)|
| 2:58:12| Of course, that is still for MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| to consider and evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10695)|
| 2:58:18| But I think it's very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10698)|
| 2:58:21| for Council to come up with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| which perhaps steers them in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10704)|
| 2:58:27| which we can approve when it comes back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10707)|
| 2:58:30| Councilmember Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| Mr. Swanson, a question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| We had a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| I think the previous Council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| about Councilmembers wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10722)|
| 2:58:45| make sure that something was considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| Is there a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| through our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| that we can make sure that they consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| by either sending them our transcript| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| I realize that's more work for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| to have to do a transcript on that item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10746)|
| 2:59:09| Is there a way without us putting it in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| or whatever that we can ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10752)|
| 2:59:15| that it is considered by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| based on what we discuss in this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| Well, when you say be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| the way you be sure is you put it in your resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| but frankly, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10767)|
| 2:59:30| our collective experience with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| and the practicalities of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10773)|
| 2:59:36| Mr. Donaldson, the Executive Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10776)|
| 2:59:39| just told us he's got three bullet points already written down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10779)|
| 2:59:42| and they are the bullet points that have arisen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| out of the discussion in this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10785)|
| 2:59:48| Are they going to consider those things? Clearly, I think they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| but when you phrase it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| I don't know, maybe Mr. Donaldson could get hit by a bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| as he leaves the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| and then we wouldn't be sure unless we put it in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| I think that's unlikely to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| and I think either way you do it, frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| is likely to end up with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| considering those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| whether you put them in the resolution or whether you don't put them in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| Council Member Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10821)|
| 3:00:24| Yeah, let me make this into the form of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| and Mr. Swanson, check my language on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10827)|
| 3:00:30| just to see if it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10830)|
| 3:00:33| The Executive Director and the professional planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission are hereby respectfully requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| and encouraged to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| consider whether self-storage facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| in all zones of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10845)|
| 3:00:48| be on major collectors or roads designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| as major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10851)|
| 3:00:54| I'm sorry, let me start over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10854)|
| 3:00:57| I can't read my own writing, it's a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10857)|
| 3:01:00| to consider whether self-storage facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| in all zones of the city be on major collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| or roads designated on the major road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10866)|
| 3:01:09| as future major collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| It can be amended to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| I'm going to make that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10875)|
| 3:01:18| I respectfully submit all zones includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| all sorts of R1, R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10881)|
| 3:01:24| Yes, but they're only allowed in certain zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| I need to ask for clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| Is there a period after what you just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10891)|
| 3:01:34| and then you delete the rest of it that's actually here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10894)|
| 3:01:37| Well, yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10897)|
| 3:01:40| I think I would do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| So maybe what you're saying is we should say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| consider whether self-storage facilities in all zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| where they are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| Does that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| You've got this written down that you can give to the recorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10916)|
| 3:01:59| Well, she can't read it either, but thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| And I hate to ask you to restate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| And I hate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| It is written down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10931)|
| 3:02:14| So we had a motion that was seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10934)|
| 3:02:17| And he just amended his motion that was seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| And the second seconded that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| The first thing we're doing is we have a motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| And it's a motion to amend this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| to say rather than what it says in section 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| it will then say what he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| rather than what it currently says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| But then he amended what he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10958)|
| 3:02:41| So do I have to do that twice is what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| No, you just need to do that once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| He just corrected what he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| All right, so we're all clear on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| Okay, so now we're on the amendment to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| Which is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10976)|
| 3:02:59| As provided to us by Councilmember Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| And that will be how I'm going to identify it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| All those in favor, please signify by saying aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| Wait a minute, Mr. Hawke was asked to have that repeated one more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| I know he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| Let me read what my language would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| The executive director and the professional planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission are hereby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| respectfully requested and encouraged to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| whether self-storage facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| in all zones where they are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| in the city be on major collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11012)|
| 3:03:35| or roads designated on the major road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| as future major collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| Period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11021)|
| 3:03:44| And then it goes to Section 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11024)|
| 3:03:47| So that precludes any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| Any other visitation of the current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| In other words, any other consideration of any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11033)|
| 3:03:56| Well, it does say consider whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| So yes, it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11039)|
| 3:04:02| Again, this would prohibit them from deleting the protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| that neighborhoods currently have that self-storage facilities need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| on major collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| Actually, they could do that anyway and send us what they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| But what we're asking them to do is look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| We're asking them not to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| is what I'm trying to do with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| I'm trying to prevent them from saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| we're going to eliminate the protections that neighborhoods currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| Well, it's up to this council as to whether that happens or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| I'm a little concerned about this being overly restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| I would like to hear from Councilman Frost before we vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| Did you want to say something, Councilmember Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| Mr. Swanson and I were just talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| We don't have that level of control over MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11090)|
| 3:04:53| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| Mr. Frost, would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| You're respectfully requesting and encouraging MPC to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| But MPC can review it in whatever way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| Whatever they think is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| regardless of what you've asked them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| I just want to hear from Councilman Frost whether he supports the amendment or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11111)|
| 3:05:14| I'm probably fine with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11114)|
| 3:05:17| Honestly, I put this on the agenda to try to move this issue along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11117)|
| 3:05:20| and the next issue that got bumped up to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| It certainly was well-intentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11123)|
| 3:05:26| I hope it was received as being well-intentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11126)|
| 3:05:29| It's late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11129)|
| 3:05:32| It's in a position where we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| I think my amendment was to help move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| I think you were doing exactly the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| I wanted to narrow it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11141)|
| 3:05:44| All those in favor of the amendment to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| Please signify by saying aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| Those opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| One no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| Now we're on the motion as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| Now before we vote on the motion as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| It may be for Councilmember Frost or Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11165)|
| 3:06:08| We've moved this 11-0 right up behind this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11168)|
| 3:06:11| I guess the question I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| It's going to impact how I view 11-J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| Are we, in essence, if 11-J passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11177)|
| 3:06:20| Are we getting ourselves in a posture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| Maybe Mr. Swanson may be able to answer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11183)|
| 3:06:26| Are we getting ourselves in a posture of making 11-0 moot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| Or pushing 11-0 off until we get our response from MPC on 11-J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11189)|
| 3:06:32| I thought 11-J just did pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11192)|
| 3:06:35| No, the amendment passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11195)|
| 3:06:38| I got lost there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11198)|
| 3:06:41| My sense, and the Council has been known to not always follow my advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11201)|
| 3:06:44| My sense would be that 11-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11204)|
| 3:06:47| I think it should be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11207)|
| 3:06:50| For eight weeks or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11210)|
| 3:06:53| To roughly the time MPC can get back with a report on 11-J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| I'd actually like to ask Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11216)|
| 3:06:59| Who represents Mr. Pinkstaff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| I know it's a delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11222)|
| 3:07:05| And I know it's not necessarily what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11225)|
| 3:07:08| But my understanding is this is something you all can live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| Rather than continuing the fight over 11-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| You're going to make him talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| I'd like to hear the answer to that also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| From either Mr. Pinkstaff or Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11240)|
| 3:07:23| I know Councilman Becker is good at reading minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11243)|
| 3:07:26| But I'd like to hear it from one of you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11246)|
| 3:07:29| On your position or posture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| That 11-0 may end up being postponed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| A couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11255)|
| 3:07:38| As a result of this vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11258)|
| 3:07:41| May I ask one question of Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| Sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| If this resolution passes tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| Do you know when the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11270)|
| 3:07:53| Would have a recommendation back before City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| I realize you can't be pinned down on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| We wouldn't be able to consider it at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| Until the November meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11282)|
| 3:08:05| Which would put it in December here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11285)|
| 3:08:08| And let me talk around that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11288)|
| 3:08:11| And invite Mr. Pinkstaff to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11291)|
| 3:08:14| Come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| He has been going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11297)|
| 3:08:20| On this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11300)|
| 3:08:23| It started here in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| May 20 of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| It had been to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11309)|
| 3:08:32| Before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11312)|
| 3:08:35| We're going to spend a year on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11315)|
| 3:08:38| And I don't want to get into the merits of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| But this is a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11321)|
| 3:08:44| I think everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11324)|
| 3:08:47| There's been a lot of discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| Everybody agrees it's a perfect project for the perfect property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| There may be somebody that disagrees with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| But they have not expressed it to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11336)|
| 3:08:59| And we've attended neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11339)|
| 3:09:02| Why don't you weigh in, Ray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| If I just can point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| I don't want to say decisions should be made based on politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| But to pass 11-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11351)|
| 3:09:14| A tie vote does not pass 11-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11354)|
| 3:09:17| A tie vote fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| The problem we have with further delays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11360)|
| 3:09:23| Is that our financing has been in place for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11363)|
| 3:09:26| Because we thought this was going to pass back in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| And that puts a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| With the economic conditions that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| And that's just because now we've had to delay so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| Our steel costs have gone up almost 35% since May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| And although we would still try to do the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| If it's delayed that long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11384)|
| 3:09:47| The longer it delays, the less likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| We have a chance to still put it together economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11390)|
| 3:09:53| Councilmember Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11393)|
| 3:09:56| That's no lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11399)|
| 3:10:02| I guess we're now ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11402)|
| 3:10:05| Any other comments before we vote on the motion as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11405)|
| 3:10:08| And before I vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| I hope not to get my hand slapped here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| But before I vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| Let me say 11-J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| I like its intent and purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| And I think ultimately it's going to come out with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| That will allay all the fears that Councilmember Pelos spoke of earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| With 11-O having some sort of precedential effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| In the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11432)|
| 3:10:35| And just ravishing neighborhoods with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11435)|
| 3:10:38| Changes in the status of major collectors, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| However| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| I've got a problem with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| The impact that I see is about to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11447)|
| 3:10:50| With 11-J being passed on 11-O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| We've been around here with 11-O for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11453)|
| 3:10:56| And I don't think it's going to solve the problem that could have happened with 11-O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11456)|
| 3:10:59| Even if 11-O passes tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| When MPC comes back with something that I think is going to be palatable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| And close that door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11465)|
| 3:11:08| I think any concern about prejudice is not going to be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| So with regards to the amended motion for 11-J| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11471)|
| 3:11:14| I'm going to probably vote against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| Not because I don't like it and I don't like where it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| But I ultimately wanted to see us take some action on 11-O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11480)|
| 3:11:23| And have 11-J serve its purpose of protecting the community in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11483)|
| 3:11:29| So I just wanted to make sure it was clear about why I was voting against it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| I like it and I think it's going to accomplish the goal that it's meant to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| But I also think we can go ahead and deal with 11-O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| So go ahead, Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11498)|
| 3:11:41| In discussing this with Mr. Pinkstaff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| Rather than an eight-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| Could you give 11-O a two-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| So he can see what his loan commitments are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11511)|
| 3:11:54| He doesn't have them here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| And at least be entitled to come back and discuss it in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11517)|
| 3:12:03| Or if the loan commitments can be renewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| That might take care of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| Well, okay, and we were actually going through a hypothetical there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| We're actually on 11-J but hearing that about 11-O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| I've got a comfort level now and I suspect that we're out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11535)|

| 3:13:50| And as folks leave we thank you all for coming out tonight on these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11630)|

| 3:14:08| I have a question about this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| This sounds like a terrific program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| And I'm certainly appreciative of the generosity of the Firefighters Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| In initiating this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11657)|
| 3:14:20| My question is do you anticipate additional personnel costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| To the City of Knoxville to administer this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| I understand that the goal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| To reach 30 preschools or to have 30 sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11669)|
| 3:14:32| And that Knoxville Firefighters will be teaching those sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| And the personnel side of this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| We can manage this program with the current staffing levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11678)|
| 3:14:41| I do not foresee any staffing problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| Or overtime issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11684)|
| 3:14:47| We will complement our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11687)|
| 3:14:50| Fire safety personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11690)|

| 3:14:56| And community schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11696)|
| 3:14:59| And I do not foresee a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11699)|

| 3:16:11| Which has concerned me for several years that I've been on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11771)|

| 3:17:11| Move approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11831)|
| 3:17:14| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11834)|
| 3:17:17| I guess anybody cares about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11837)|
| 3:17:20| I did make a telephone call this afternoon to Madeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11840)|
| 3:17:23| While the city's in the process of negotiating a contract with an energy savings company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| To do an audit of our services in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11846)|
| 3:17:29| And then to get recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11849)|
| 3:17:32| And so I was concerned that we were kind of putting the cart ahead of the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11852)|
| 3:17:35| Since we're getting ready to go into this full scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| And the answer was that the original proposal was much broader than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11858)|
| 3:17:41| More than twice as expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| And it was scaled back in recognition of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11864)|
| 3:17:47| Oncoming energy audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| But the needs are so critical and it would be at least a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| Before that audit is completed and then we make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| And then we actually do things to our HVA systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11876)|
| 3:17:59| And the folks are uncomfortable over there and some changes need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11879)|
| 3:18:02| So this is sort of a stop gap measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| No further lights, all in favor signify by saying aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11885)|

| 3:19:38| And I came around by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| What's the building over here Rob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| The former state supreme court building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11984)|
| 3:19:47| There were two flags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11987)|
| 3:19:50| A Tennessee flag and a U.S. flag that had slipped down the pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11990)|
| 3:19:53| And were laying on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| And I talked to Rob the next day and he got the flags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11996)|
| 3:19:59| Picked up like they should have been done in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=11999)|

| 3:20:17| I can't get in and out of these things that's why I'm always standing back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=12017)|
| 3:20:20| My suggestion was to Rob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=12020)|
| 3:20:23| And an idea I had was for some benches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=12023)|
