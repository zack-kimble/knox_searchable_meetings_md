| 0:00:30| Welcome to the Board of Education's December 5th 2022 work session. Please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=42)|
| 0:01:00| Thank you. I see Commissioner Jay is joining us tonight, so I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=60)|
| 0:01:25| welcome him. Do we have any other elected officials here? Okay. Seeing none, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| have one announcement. Board members, TSBA has scheduled the Legislative and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| Legal Institute for February 16th and 17th in Nashville. If you haven't let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| Terri know yet, please let her know as soon as possible if you would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| attend. Also, for those, before we get started, for those in attendance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| I want to remind everyone that the Board of Education's public meetings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| the only opportunity we have to discuss items that come before us as an elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| body, so we ask that if you do want to have conversations with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| that you would step outside of the room to do so, because it makes it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| difficult for us to hear, and also refrain from any cheering or booing or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| groaning or whatnot, just because it does make it difficult to hear. With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| that being said, do we have any changes to this agenda? So we have a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=142)|
| 0:02:31| Ms. Horne and a second by Ms. Henderson. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| Motion carries. Superintendent Risewood. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| I can't use these new mics. I need to adjust them, but I guess we don't have to. So thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| Actually, I want to apologize on the front side. This update's a little lengthy, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| just so you know, and I'm gonna make sure I stick to some of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| script on some of these notes, so a couple of items to cover. So one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| best parts of my job is the chance to visit schools. I see the outstanding work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| of educators, staff, and students. Last week I had the chance to go to Spring Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| and spend half the day with fourth grade teacher Jessica Beeler. It was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| incredible time there with her, just to be able to see her, the way she planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| and the intentionality that she used in her reading classes and in her math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| classes. I really enjoyed that time with her. I was also very impressed with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| culture of academic excellence that's been created by Tiffany Watkins, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| principal there. She's a great leader, and I know she's a new principal there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| at that school, but I actually had teachers stop by while I was in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| just to come and tell me that, and I don't know if she was paying them. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| kidding. She and Mr. Spikes both had stopped by a couple times and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| just really, just really could feel that in the school, and so just very thankful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| that they hosted and allowed me to spend that time there. It was great. So I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| want to talk about on Friday, I was excited to attend the graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| ceremony for our new school security officers. As you all know, school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| security, I mean school safety is our top priority, and we still believe well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| trained officers that are highly skilled are very essential to the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| that we do. So together with our law enforcement officers, these new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| officers will help keep our school safe and secure. It was great to see them. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| you haven't had a chance to be at one of those, there's really, it's really neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| I mean, they get to talk some about the trainings they've had and just how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| proud they are, and it's neat to see families there and just to have them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| celebrate. So I really enjoyed that. I know we'll probably hear more about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| tonight, but I want to be the first to say was also exciting Friday night for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| the West High football team who won the state championship after an undefeated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| season. So congratulations to them. I was fortunate. I didn't able to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| the game, but I was able to go to the send off at West and be there and got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| to speak to the teams for a minute. So that was great. So it's a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| championship. Got to talk to coach as well. And I just know his reputation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| raising young men into young boys into men is great. He does a wonderful job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| of that. So glad to see that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| Okay. So this next part is where it takes a little time, right? So I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| go into this agenda, trying to get this agenda together. We have lots of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| that came across this agenda and lots of things that, so there's a few items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| that actually were on at one point have been pulled off. So I want to give some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| information to that. The first is the background information on the Duncan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| Sons contract. It was originally placed on this agenda prior to tonight's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| meeting. I provided you. So if you look, you should have on your sheet here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| some highlighted in yellow. So this is the vacancies we currently have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| our custodians by school. Dr Adams and his team have done a great job to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| that. So sometimes it helps to have that data and see that data on looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| that. So I say these things want to explain why it was pulled and to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| to you about what our plan is for January. Um, so prior to tonight's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| agenda, I provided each board member with a number of custodial vacancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| by school. As you can see, we can we continue to have a critical shortage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| custodians. Uh, despite innovative actions like last year, you all proved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| to 4% raised for this, excuse me, 8% raised for the custodians for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| maintenance department. Our maintenance department has provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| transportation to job sites for folks who don't live in some of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| for the schools to get them there. Um, it's still at this point. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| some schools that aren't up to the cleanliness that we would expect our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| schools to be. And that's not a reflection on our custodians. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| reflection on the lack of help and support that we have. Uh, so after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| continuing to hear concerns from our principals through a couple ways, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| we have a principal advisory council, and that is a topic that's come on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| multiple times, not just this year, but also last year when we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| shortage, as well as some principals who reached out to us individually. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| actually asked Dr Adams a couple months ago to start exploring what can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| we do to supplement to support to make sure we have the schools the way they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| need to be as far as cleanliness go. Uh, so Dr Adams has carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| researched, worked with our law department as well to secure a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| contract formally the key word here, right? Just so everybody knows for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| supplemental services. This is not a replacement of custodians. This is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| a reduction that we're not going to continue to advertise and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| recruit custodians. This is supplemental to try to help our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| custodians who are working lots of hours of overtime on lots of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| weekends and things that Dr Adams has been a great advocate for saying we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| need to take care of our folks. I know he's met with our custodial staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| multiple times this year and most recently, even last week. Eso with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| of that said, working with our law department to secure a contract for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| supplemental custodial services from Duncan and son. So again, to Dr Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| credit researched around other districts in the area. And were they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| happy with the supplemental service? That sort of thing. And Duncan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| sons is a local provider of those services that we feel good about. So in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| January, Dr Adams will bring a plan for these supplemental services to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| board. Uh, and so the question could come. Why aren't we doing that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| now? Uh, so the extra month will allow our operations team time to have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| in depth conversations with school administrators and specific custodians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| as well as to consider additional schools that may benefit for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| supplemental services. Originally, when the contract was put on, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| looking at feeder patterns of Farragut, Hardin Valley and Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| because those are the ones that we saw a great, the greatest full feeder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| pattern deficits. And since we've continued to pull this information, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| see some others that could potentially benefit from that. Um, and also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| conversations have been had with some of the principles and some at a high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| level about looking at this as well as with custodians. Again, kudos to Dr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| Adams, who's met with our custodians face to face and had those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| conversations. But we still feel like we want to make sure there are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| questions and that the people have had individuals have had conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| about that before we move forward with the plan. So let me be clear. We value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| our custodians as valuable members of the Casey's family. As a principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| myself, they were very important members of our team as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| They're very important members of our team. They still are. So we will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| eliminate any of our current custodians, nor do we have a plan to relocate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| from their current schools against their will. Sometimes custodians asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| for that because it's closer to home or those kinds of things we've been. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| would do that. We're not asking them to move in this plan. Um, so we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| this contract is a short term solution that will continue to fulfill our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| custodial openings and will continue to fill our custodial openings in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| future. Eso I would say this too. We have reached a critical issue, as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| see, in that if the board has other ideas on how we might be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| this or additional to that, I would ask in January that you all continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| bring those to the staff and we'd be willing to bring those forward as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| But for now, again, to try to help our custodians out and try to get where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| need to be. I hope we get to a place where we have so many custodians that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| we don't have to do this for long. But in the meantime, the cleanliness of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| the schools is important as well. So I just want to clear any of that up as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| far as why as why that was pulled and wild beyond in January. And then my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| final one, you know, it's been a long time. Sorry. My final one is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| just to talk to, um, the future of community schools in United Way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| was on there. Um, so, as you may know, earlier this semester, the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Education Foundation worked with United Way of Greater Knoxville to discuss a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| plan to transition the operations of KCS community schools from the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| Ed Foundations to United Way. Both boards have voted and United Way will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| assume operations of the Knox County Schools community schools in June of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| 2023. So not yet, but in the summer, after discussion between both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| organizations, legal team, both organizations, legal teams, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| decided that it was better for United Way to bring their full plan for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| future community schools to the board for an M. O. U. To approve later in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| spring after they seek input and can capture best practices for community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| schools moving forward. I'm gonna say I'm gonna say something about Matt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Ryerson. I'm gonna ask him to come up for a second. Matt Ryerson is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| guy. There's the CEO of United Way that we have in our community. I've really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| enjoyed getting to know him over the last couple months, and I'm really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| excited just to hear the passion and vision that they have. The commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| that they have is to is to really assess what is working in community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| schools and where we need more resource. I mean, more support for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| kids to be successful, and I think United Way will provide that in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| partnership. So I'm very supportive of that on where it's going. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| initially we had that on there because we thought there was some reason to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| that so they could begin some transition. But we feel at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| M. O. U. Is not ready. I mean, not ready, not needed at this point, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| we look forward to the plan. They will bring in the spring that will move us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| forward for future years with detail and input on how community schools could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| be even better. So with that, I'd like to offer Mr Ryerson a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| I see a lot of familiar faces and just want to thank you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| to come and visit with you and really share our enthusiasm. As John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| mentioned, we've spent the better part of a year, year and a half really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| researching this community school strategy, what it would mean for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| Knoxville, the children and families and really the communities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| neighborhoods that it served. I do want to recognize, uh, your your chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| Christie Christie has already recognized, uh, council member. No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| Commissioner J. Commissioner J, who also happens to serve as the chair of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| the Knox Education Foundation, and it's been an incredible partnership with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| them and transitioning that program. We continue to talk very closely with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| team at Knox Education Foundation as well as KCS staff and leadership. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| fact, we did a tour today of Dogwood Elementary, which is, uh, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| model community schools, 16 of them in total, and we're just really blown away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| by the team and leadership there in the United Way could not be more excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| about this opportunity. It is collaborative. So as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| these conversations continue to happen with the KCS team and leadership. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| know the legal team has been very helpful, and our general counsel has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| already talked with the legal team here at KCS, and we feel like we're gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| get a very strong MOU with shared roles and expectations of how do we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| this a world class community schools? We already have a terrific platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| that's executing very well. I think the next step is how do we make even a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| more robust investment into that work? So on behalf of the United Way and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| United Way Board of Directors, I'm just here to say thank you. And we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| anxious to serve alongside of you as we serve our community. So, John, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| know if you have any questions or... I do not have any questions. I think these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=806)|
| 0:13:36| weird. I don't know. We have new mics tonight. But I did, we did have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=816)|
| 0:13:45| opportunity to have lunch the other day, and I am really excited about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| transition and the vision, and just want to stress again that we're still going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| to have community schools, right? It's just a different organization, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| know that there were some concerns about that when initially we started talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| about that, and I just really appreciate United Way and the work you've done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| to come forward and help us with that. Yeah, yeah, to reconfirm that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| clear, both, I don't want to speak on behalf of the Knox Education Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| but they are committed to ensuring community schools, and we are absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| invested. Our board took numerous votes. Unanimous and enthusiastic to take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| this strategy. It is mission central to our work in the community as a whole, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| we can't wait to jump into it. So we're very excited. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| Chair. So, Mr. Morrison, I appreciate the conversations that we've had over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| last couple months about this issue, and really appreciate how attentive United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| Way is in terms of studying the matter and trying to really get your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| around it, and you just mentioned the statement kind of mission-centric. Can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| you just say a word about how this is mission-centric to United Way? Because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| think a lot of people who have traditional inclinations of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| United Way is might be thinking, oh, this seems a little out of the box, so can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| you just say a word to that? Yeah, I think at face value can look like a seismic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| shift, but the truth is it really does align to our mission. If you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| United Way historically, United Way historically was an organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| identified community needs, raised funds to support those needs, and partnered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| with organizations to find solutions to address those challenges. This is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| much the same. Community schools is a very similar model at a micro level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| right? So at a neighborhood or school-based model. So it's the same idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| of getting that community together, listening to the needs of that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| raising resources to invest, and creating partnerships and collectives to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| dig down and support families, children, the schools as they walk on this journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| So for us, it's really similar to what we've done for a hundred years, more so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| on the neighborhood level. And for us, that's probably the best way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| accomplish this, is not to be removed from those problems, but really walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| alongside families, listen to their, have them guide that process, and have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| have a voice in the outcomes of that work. So yeah, to us, it's mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| centric. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=979)|
| 0:16:32| I have a question here. Yes, Dr. Reisman. Sorry, I want to ask a question actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| about the Duncan and Sons thing real quick, and it's just out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| complete curiosity. On the last page of this, it says the dream team. What is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| dream team? There's three of them. I mean, I want to be a part of that. That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you, Mr. O'Rourke. We've recruited Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Duncan. I'm actually, I mean, I know what it is, but Dr. Adams will probably describe it better than I will, so I'll let him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1012)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you, Dr. Reiswick. So basically, the dream team is a group of individuals that go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| schools that are in desperate need of help, and they do a deep cleaning. So they will travel around and kind of provide supplemental services needed? That is correct, and they have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1034)|
| 0:17:24| schools, so it's just in addition to their regular responsibilities, they will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| in as a team and do a deep cleaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Yeah, they are fantastic. All right, so moving into the next item, I believe this is also yours, Dr. Reiswick. Thank you, Madam Chair. I promise I won't talk any more after this, but we're talking about Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1053)|
| 0:18:03| McPherson comes up. I just wanted the presentation or update, playground update, for the board. So several of you have reached out to the staff or to myself since October when we kind of sent out that initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1083)|
| 0:18:16| potential cost for the playground that had been brought up once before. So as a result, I've asked our team to put together a presentation to go through different options. So what you'll see in this presentation will be some different options as to how they relate to the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1096)|
| 0:18:30| We'll have an overview of kind of the methodology of how we got to assess the needs and the cost analysis, potential funding options. Ron's done a great job and really headed that for us. And also an overview of potential trade-offs, each funding option might occur. And just two things, I really feel like that's our job as a staff is to bring you guys as much information as you need to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1110)|
| 0:18:55| But I will let you know too, because I've talked about this with our staff, my greatest concern moving forward is out years, we're in a good situation budget-wise right now with federal funds that are in and those sorts of things. But I do think, and Ron will explain some of these, there are some competing interests that I think when we look down the road, and some of these are kind of like hidden we don't think about, and I don't want to steal your thunder, but things like debt service that roll over into our general purpose budget right now that really should be back in debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1135)|
| 0:19:25| So there's some things, and Jim, from my view, you haven't asked for my opinion, but I'll tell you, is that there are some things we could do to kind of shore things up for the future. That doesn't mean I don't think it should play, that doesn't mean I don't think playgrounds are important, it's just that I think there are things, in my personal opinion, I'll live with whatever, I'm not going to, you know, be supportive. But that's why you maybe haven't heard me as pushing this out as much, just wanted to make sure that was clear. So with that, Mr. McPherson, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1165)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you, Dr. Riser. Is there a present, can we get the presentation up, maybe, and as we go through that, thanks. As we go through that, John, I don't know that either one of us has ever been on a dream team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1192)|
| 0:20:04| That's right, that's right. So first off, before we get into this, let me just say that the information used to, it was a team approach, first off, and the information we used to be able to put this presentation together was largely derived from information as a result of what our playground inspector found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1204)|
| 0:20:32| And so, okay, I may have to get, does this work? Let me see. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, yeah. So, what was found is that the inspections were performed about 40%, maybe a little over 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1232)|
| 0:21:02| 22 of our elementary schools. The playgrounds there were actually in pretty good working order. No real needs associated with that. Now, of course, that left the remaining 60%. What do we do with that? So, our inspector divided these up into three different priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1262)|
| 0:21:19| And so the first one was priority three. It's about 25% of our, the playgrounds at 25% of our schools fell in this area, which generally in pretty good condition. Now, there were some repairs needed, some of the equipment, but if the schools found the money to make some of those repairs, replacement parts could be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1279)|
| 0:21:43| They could be found, so it would not be a heavy lift in order to actually find the parts to remedy the situations at those schools. Priority two, however, it's about 15% of the elementary schools, and what was found is that there are repairs needed for some of that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1303)|
| 0:22:00| The downside is that for some of that equipment, some replacement parts are unavailable, and that's usually a result of maybe the playground, the vendor maybe is no longer in business, or maybe the equipment is too old, and so replacement parts can't be found, and so you would just have to replace the whole piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1320)|
| 0:22:21| And so, obviously, those schools in the second priority, the playgrounds there would be a bit more costly than what we would find in priority three. So, priority one, these are the areas with our most significant needs, about 20% of our schools there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1341)|
| 0:22:40| And repairs are needed for this equipment. Unfortunately, replacement parts are unavailable, whether that's the equipment is just too old, the vendor is out of business, or a piece of equipment is outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1360)|
| 0:22:51| And by the way, if I misspeak on this, I've got the real brains here behind this would be Doug Shover and Adam Parson, right? So if I misspeak, hopefully they'll come up here and correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1371)|
| 0:23:04| Or if they raise their hand, tell me and we'll let them come up here. But this is, again, this would be our most significant needs if we were to address the schools in these priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1384)|
| 0:23:16| Okay, so where are they? Where are these schools located? So we took a look at this by region. Now keep in mind, this was not any particular directive by the district over the years to necessarily inform the numbers to look this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1396)|
| 0:23:31| These are just how the numbers have fallen out over time. And so you can see on the left the priorities, priority one, two, and three, and then those with playgrounds in good condition across the top, you'll see the region structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1411)|
| 0:23:44| And we thought it was important to maybe put it in the region structure. And we're going to look at how this falls out with board district two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| But we kind of like for this new model, we kind of like for people to kind of be used to looking at this regional structure. And so what you'll see in region one, it's pretty good. It's pretty consistent across the categories there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1431)|
| 0:24:03| You'll find a couple of schools falling in each priority. Region two, pretty much the same thing. Region three, now you'll see region three is in really good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1443)|
| 0:24:14| Out of the 11 schools, none are in priorities one or two. So we've got a couple in priority three. None of the 11 schools are in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| I think, and we'll get to that when we show the board district, I think it'll bear that out and make a little more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Because over the last several years, some of our schools in the south Knoxville area, I know Ms. Chrissy can speak to this, have made some very concerted efforts to upground their playgrounds over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1468)|
| 0:24:41| And so whether that's been a combination of private donations, internal school funds, sometimes it's a combination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| But the parent groups have worked really hard to bring those playgrounds up to standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| And so I dare say that a couple of years ago, if you would have looked at this, it wouldn't look this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| And so we're kind of seeing the improvement that those schools have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| Region four, you can see some pretty significant needs there, especially, well you can see 11 of the 12 schools are in one of the three priority areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1505)|
| 0:25:16| Region five is kind of an anomaly. It's interesting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| Six of the 10 schools there with playgrounds fall under priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| But yet we have four of the schools that are in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| There's kind of like no in-between there, kind of a feast or famine, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| So what does this look like by board district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| And there you'll kind of see how this lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| And so for district one, you'll notice that looks a lot like region five, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Because we have a number of schools in district one in region five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| So again, half the schools with playgrounds in district one fall under priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1548)|
| 0:25:57| But yet the other half, they're in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| District two, you'll see kind of a somewhat consistent spread across that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| District three with only the one elementary school, but it fell under priority two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| District four, you'll see the spread there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| District five, we have two schools there, one under priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| One is actually in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| District six looks pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| No schools there fell under priorities one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| So four of the six are in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| District seven, you can see that we don't have any schools that made that best category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| So all five schools are really within those priority areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| District eight, so half of the schools are in priority three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Obviously, those better than being in priority two or one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| And then we had a few there that's in pretty good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| And then district nine, and this kind of speaks back to in region three, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| So we have some south Knoxville schools in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| And so again, over the last couple of years, they've made some pretty significant strides in improving their playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| So for the most part in that district, it looks to be pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| So this is the thing that everybody wants to get to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| What's the estimated initial cost to bring all playgrounds up to standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Let me just say the real caveat here is this is not an exact science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| So we're not going to have a precise cost on what it would be to bring all the playgrounds up to standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| unless we just went out and got quotes for all of the playgrounds across the district, right, that were in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| And so obviously we haven't done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| So we tried to attack this as best that we could in some kind of a rational or logical approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| And so we used three cost models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| One, we're going to call it a cost per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| Let me just say in all three models to some extent we have relied on a cost per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| But with this one, this is just kind of right out of the block, kind of a simple approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| It's a base cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| And so that was based on from several months ago we received an estimate that for the new northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1680)|
| 0:28:11| if we were to build a playground from the ground up, right, it would be about $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| And so we just simply divided that by the capacity of the school, which is 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| Obviously the school is not going to open up with the max capacity of 1,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| but that gave us that, okay, if it was at max and we had a playground structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| that came out to $250 per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| And so what we did is we took 250, we looked at all of the schools in priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| And we looked at the average daily membership or the enrollment in priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| We added all of the students that would be affected in that priority and those groups of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| simply multiplied it by $250 to come up with the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| And in a second we'll show a summary of what those costs are for all three models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| And then we just took that same methodology, applied it to priority two schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| but we backed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Instead of charging the full cost, we backed it down to about a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| with the understanding that priority two would not be as expensive, obviously, as priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| But there's, again, I want to emphasize there's really no exact science in backing that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| It's just intuitively we knew that that would be less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Did the same thing for, and then multiplied that by the total ADMs for the total number of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| with the total number of ADMs, multiply it by that rate to come up with the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| Did the same thing for priority one, backed it down to a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| So the second model we used is what we're going to call a playground utilization rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| That's based on our discussions with vendors back several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| And it was determined at that time that a pretty good rate is about 20% of students at elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1784)|
| 0:29:52| are at recess at any given moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| And so we used that factor, and it was also based on those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| based on the average square foot cost that would be associated with the student at play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| based on the equipment that would be available there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| It was about $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| But I'll just summarize it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| It ultimately came out on a per-pupil cost of about $400,000 per child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| So, again, it's more expensive than that first model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| So we just used that, applied it across the board to the total number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| falling in schools in priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Did the same thing for priority two, backed it down to a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Same thing for priority three, backed it down another third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| And I think the first model came out to about $2.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| the second about $4.4 million or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| We'll get to that here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| And then the third way is randomly selected quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Interestingly, this came out higher than the others, which kind of scares us a little bit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| Because these were actual quotes, and we did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| but now it was based on a small sampling of schools from each priority group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| maybe two or three, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| And so we got actual quotes, and whatever that school was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| we looked at their average membership, divided it by a cost per child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| Did the same thing for the other school in that sampling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| did an average and extrapolated that data across all schools in that priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| And we did the same thing for priority two, did the same thing for priority three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| So here's how the numbers stacked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| So these are in millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| So that first methodology, if you go across the top row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| if we use that first one, go all the way to the right, you'll see it's $2.84 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Again, all of these scenarios included the New Northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| because the assumption is if we were going to bring all schools up to standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| clearly we would include the New Northwest school within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| Playground utilization rate, far right column, 4.35 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| Randomly selected quotes, 5.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| So you can see there's a real big range there, right, from 2.8 million to 5.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| And so we just took the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And again, there's a lot of caveats here, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| unless we went back and did actual quotes for all of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| with all of the equipment it needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| So it's 4.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| We wanted to take a look at it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| If you look at the average daily membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| so for Priority 1, 4,633 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| those were the number of students in all of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| who had playgrounds that fell in Priority 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| And you can see per pupil cost there of $367.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Again, that's based on an average cost of 4.2 million across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| Priority 2, you can see more students affected under those schools in Priority 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| came to 232 under Priority 3, 6903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| So we had more schools that fell under that category, more students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| But as to be expected, you can see that the per pupil cost for Priority 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| more than Priority 2, Priority 2 more than Priority 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| which is what we would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| Okay, so if the board wanted to go down this road, how would we pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| Again, this is the initial funding to bring all of the schools up to program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| So there's three that really kept jumping into our mind when we were looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| One would be fund balance, and we're going to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| kind of the pros and cons for each category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| So fund balance would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Capital plan would be the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| The other would be to seek partnerships with other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| So let's look at fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| So the pros, the first one is kind of obvious, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| It's a one-time cost. It's an acceptable use of one-time funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Now, if the board were to decide to commit to doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| I do think there would probably be an expectation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| if all schools were brought to standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| the playgrounds at all schools brought to standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| we would want to keep that going, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| We wouldn't just want to walk away from it and be back at this point again in 10 years or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| So there would be some recurring costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| We'll get into that in another slide later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| But to bring, for instance, this initial cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| it would be an acceptable use of one-time funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| because technically it's a non-recurring cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Another pro is that we do have a solid fund balance level right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| But there are some disadvantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| There's some cons here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| One is, and I'm going to keep emphasizing this over the next couple of slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| the actual costs are still to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| It could be more than $4.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Remember, when we looked at actual quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| although it was just for a few schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| it was significantly higher than the other two methods that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| So the actual cost, it could be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| We just don't know until we get actual quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| This is the one that's the big red flag here, the uncertain economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Now, economists, if you look at all of the articles right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| economists are kind of all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| You have some that are saying that a recession could hit anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Some are saying it could hit three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Some are saying it could hit sometime next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| We just don't know when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Some are saying, okay, it could be 18 months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| So it's kind of all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Now, keep in mind, the economists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| fortunately they missed it badly with COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| because the economy kind of initially took a little hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| and then it bounced way back pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| The thing that does concern me a bit, though, in an uncertain economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| is I was here in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| I think it was 2007, 2008 when the recession hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| And that particular year, we missed our budget revenue projections by $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| And so in order to keep operations going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| we had to dip into fund balance to just continue to keep the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| When I say operations, that's kind of a non-threatening word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| to not have to say payroll, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| because that's where most of your operations come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| And so fortunately we didn't have what I would call necessarily a huge fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| but it was sufficient enough to get us through that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| The following two years, the federal government had the ARRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| American Recovery Reinvestment Act, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| We were able to actually use those federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| and save 100 teaching positions for two years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And so those dollars really paid off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| because those dollars allowed us to buy time for the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| to kind of work its way back up into a level that we could sustain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Without those federal dollars, we would have struggled really badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| If something like that hit again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| there's no guarantee that there would be any kind of federal relief dollars anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| So I think that's why it's important that we always have to be really guarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| in how we use our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| And so we want to continue to keep an eye on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| I can tell you that the last two years have just been banner years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| with sales tax collections, two of the best years I can ever remember back to back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| The first couple of data points, though, that we've looked at this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| while it seems to still be encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| and maybe perhaps even a little more than what we had budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| it looks like it's not quite to the growth level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| as what we've experienced over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| So we're keeping a really close eye on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| So if that's starting to kind of turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| we want to be really careful in watching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| And then lastly, to use fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| it would be essentially utilizing funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| or utilizing dollars that might otherwise compete for other initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| And the reason I thought that was important to put that up there is with textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Those who have been on the board long enough to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| where do we always pay textbooks from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| We always pay it from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| We start out budget deliberations every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| and we include fund balance in there because we want to get it into the recurring budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| And then lo and behold, as we're trying to balance the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| ultimately we look down through the list and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| well, there's textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| We can fund that through fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Let's pull that out and it helps us balance the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| But there's probably only so many years that we'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| At some point, we really need to make a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| to try to get those dollars into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| And I can tell you, they can be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| We'll get into that here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| So historically, we funded textbook adoptions through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Facility upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| Our practice mainly is to use the capital plan for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| but with the pandemic, and Dr. Adams can attest to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| the cost of the supply chain has really increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| So the cost of instruction has increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| and we had to go back to fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Otherwise, we'd have had to modify the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| We went to fund balance to kind of meet the difference there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| for those costs that had exceeded original projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| I think we went back to, over the last couple of years with facility upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| probably $8 or $9 million we've had to kick in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Because we want to be really careful on those debt levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And so we work really closely with county finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| And so those debt levels, when the raters come in and look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| they'll look at that total debt level from the county perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| So there's an obligation from both the district and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| to try to keep those combined levels reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| Because otherwise, when they start to increase beyond a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| it starts to have an adverse effect on your interest rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| which then obviously it's going to be costlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| when you pay the interest on that principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| We've also funded some student devices with our one-to-one cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| The bulk of that we have been able to fund under ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| ESSER will go away, of course, in a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| We'll talk some more on that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Vehicle purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Normally we try to budget vehicle purchases in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| because we can see, OK, down the road is a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| It's a dump truck. It's got 150,000 miles on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| We have to buy new and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| But sometimes we'll get kind of blindsided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| I know we had some maintenance vehicles we had to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| We had some, I think, hearing and vision vans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| We had kind of driven the wheels off of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| And so suddenly we kind of got all the mileage we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| and then we had to replace them during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| So we do have some vehicle purchases there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| That's not an exhaustive list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| but I just wanted to underscore the fact that we have had to go back to fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| to address some of these things that didn't make it into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| OK, capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Well, now keep in mind the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| we typically fund projects over time through municipal bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| And so we use general obligation bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| and it's typically a 20-year payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| The advantage here with the capital plan is if the board wanted to undertake this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| we wouldn't have to write a check for like $4.2 million and set it aside, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| So you could pay for it over time, and you spread those payments out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| It's kind of like a mortgage, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| So we would finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| But the disadvantage there, again, I wanted to put this in front of the board again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| actual costs will still be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| We don't know it's $4.2 million, it could be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| But when you finance something over time, you add to your debt levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| And so that's, once again, we're kind of buttoned up to that maximum amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| that we don't want to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| And so we would be adding to the debt level if we were to program into the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2503)|
| 0:41:51| I'm not saying it's a deal killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| I don't mean it that way, but it's just more debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Either that, or we would need to go back into the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| and identify projects that would come off, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| That would be the only way not to increase the debt level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| We would have to identify some projects that, well, we're just not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| we value this initiative maybe more so than another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| And kind of the obvious that on the, you know, kind of the pro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| in that you avoid the initial cash payment on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| You pay for it over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| The downside is you incur interest charges over that same amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| So normally you can figure, we went back and looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| If you, like for the capital plan, for every dollar you borrow over a 20-year span,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| you're going to pay like $1.50, probably something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| So it adds cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| It's about kind of like half again, about 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| And then lastly, if we were to use general obligation bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| those are a typical 20-year buyback or pay down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| So we know that playground equipment generally is not going to last 20 years, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| unless you do something about that, unless you replace it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| So the problem here is that with a capital plan, what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| you're paying for it over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| You're incurring more cost than what it otherwise would cost through the interest charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| And you're potentially paying interest, principal and interest payback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| with an asset that no longer exists, right, because it's already out of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| So you kind of, you know, you have to kind of weigh that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| So there's some pros for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| There's some disadvantages for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| I say partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| The obvious one here is that it would be a shared investment, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| that, okay, the board would not be bearing the whole entire cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Could there be some sort of cooperation with other municipalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| Like I'm certainly not saying this would be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| but we could approach maybe the county and the city and maybe some sort of a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Maybe we could approach, you know, private donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| and try to kind of nickel and dime our way up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| But the downside there, again, additional costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| It could be more than the 4.2, like we've said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| But the potential there is, like, can you really secure $4.2 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| So what if, you know, there's an agreement here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| but you don't really secure the total amount of funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| So then it limits the number of sites that you could address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| And so if that's the case, then it kind of creates some challenges, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| So, you know, in order to, let's say we got half of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| or a fourth of those funds or a tenth of those, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| What would be the selection criteria, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| So there would have to be some determination there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Would it be in the form of grant applications, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| Could it, would there be a selection committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Probably would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| What about schools that what we don't, the thing we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| we wouldn't want to do is, like, create some sort of hope or expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| and a school apply and then ultimately not enough money for them to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| So those are some things we would have to grapple with if we went down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| So now, you know, we talked about if the board were to bring all of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| all of the playgrounds at the schools up to standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| there likely would be some expectation to maintain that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| And so if so, there are, there will be some recurring costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| that would be associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| So let's talk about some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| We've estimated that, again, these are soft numbers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| We have an annual estimate of $587,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and that's within equipment and purchasing to make up that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| So let's talk about equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| So we would want to get schools on a replacement cycle, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| So it's like every 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| We don't know the life of, I mean, there's no exact science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| for the life of a piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| It would depend on the participation rate and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| We took a look at this, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| there's a different range with the life of playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| But what we kept seeing was anything from 8 years to 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| So we just kind of went in the middle and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| okay, 10 years sounds pretty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| And if it's $4.2 million to bring all the schools up to standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| the assumption is it would be a 10-year replacement cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| so then that would be $420,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| because we do know that some schools are in really good condition right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| but then that would be money that, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| you have some schools that would start to kind of roll off, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| They would need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| So we would probably need to be thinking about how we're going to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| those schools that don't have the most immediate needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| and get schools on a rolling replacement cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| But, again, if the annual cost is more than $4.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| or, sorry, the initial cost is more than $4.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| and we're on a 10-year replacement cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| obviously that could affect the annual cost, which would be higher than $420,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| And then additional personnel, we're thinking probably three additional positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| One would be a playground manager, and then we would, let me go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| two additional maintenance workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| And so these would be folks that would be focused on maintaining playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| You know, we have over 50 elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| We have actually more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| We have multiple playgrounds at some facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| So it would be a full-time job trying to maintain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| So that would be initially the best guesstimate we have for an annual cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| This would be in the general purpose fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| The one thing, though, is we want to make sure that folks understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| what's on the horizon for potential future costs, future budgetary considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| And I've heard the superintendent on more than one occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| and I don't want to speak for the superintendent, but I've heard one of his priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Obviously a salary increase is trying to increase, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| the average salaries for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| And so our PECA agreement right now is a 4% annual increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| We've been able to meet that three of the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| We actually had never met it, right, until about four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| and we've been able to meet it three of the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| I know a priority superintendent can continue to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| because we want to increase our ranking in comparison to other districts in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| We have actually made some strides, but we're not anywhere where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| So obviously we don't want to go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| But every time we do that, if you look at a 4% increase plus steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| you're looking at an annual cost of $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| That would be $20 million every year as long as we continue to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| a minimum, because obviously, you know, you have inflationary costs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| So that's a pretty significant investment every year that we want to place as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| Another, and I alluded to this earlier, increasing debt obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| major initiatives there, and you're going to know these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| So four new facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| So Lawnsdale-A near Burnett, new Northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| and then a new Farragut on the horizon, Farragut Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| And so those are huge, very needed significant investments in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2953)|
| 0:49:21| Also, that's not to mention our HVAC and roofing upgrades that we continue to have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| And again, these are just the major initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| HVA addition, we're putting, like, what, maybe 30 classrooms, 28, 32, somewhere around that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| So that's additional debt rolling online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| And this is kind of a sobering thought, but our current five-year capital plan total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| if you look at just the projects on the approved plan in this five-year total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| it's an additional debt of $163 million within the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| That's if we don't have any other needs that come on the radar in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| And it's like we've looked perfectly into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| There's nothing else there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| We know that's probably not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| So again, that's pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Now, I think there's probably sometimes, and I even have to watch it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| and sometimes there's this idea that, well, it's the capital plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| So we do that through bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| We're not talking about the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Well, we actually are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| And so the capital plan debt costs are supplemented by the general purpose budget about half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| The general purpose budget has about half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| So how did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Well, it's been a product over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| So the county has a debt service fund that services the debt for all projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| both the county and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| And that fund is supported through property tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| And that fund has been supported over time through just natural growth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| Because there's been, what, 22 years maybe since we've had a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| So that's been sustained over time through just natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Well, what's happened is over that same time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| our growth with debt obligations has exceeded the revenue going into that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3072)|
| 0:51:20| And obviously the capital plan initiatives that we've undertaken are very much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| But just the reality of it is that the debt service requirements, the principal and interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| the growth in the capital plan has exceeded what the debt service fund has the capacity to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| So then what happens is over time the general purpose budget has had to fund the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| And so for this year it's probably around $17 or $18 million in the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| So just know that for every brick and mortar, whatever, we undertake in the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3109)|
| 0:51:57| just know that ultimately it's kind of the trend here has been whatever that project has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| about half of that cost is going to be funded through the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| And so if there's $17 million of costs going right now towards supplementing debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| and again, these are very much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| So don't hear me say that, hey, these shouldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| They're very much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| But the reality of it is that $17 million of educational initiatives that we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| So I just wanted to kind of keep that in front of the board there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| that that's why there's such this urgent need to watch our total debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| Also, with future budgetary considerations, net staffing increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| Currently we're really evaluating that closely, especially in line with our budget deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| On how we staff schools, we've had a staffing formula for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| We've made tweaks to that formula, but we're really taking a hard look on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| are we staffing schools the way we need to be staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| And so we've got a lot of folks kind of weighing in on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| and getting a lot of input on some ideas on what we need to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| So we also have new school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| And what I mean by that is while Wansdale and Adrian Burnett are essentially replacement schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| the new Northwest and the Farragut Elementary will not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| So we could say, well, there's going to be rezoning, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Can't we just shift teachers and positions along with that and work it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| But we just know that it doesn't always come out perfectly in groups of 25 or 20 kids, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| Also, you have things, obvious costs like utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| You have transportation costs, things you didn't incur before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| You have administrative costs and support that you need at the school and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| So we know there's going to be additional staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| IEP needs, these never go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We do as much as we can, and I know Jason and his folks do a fantastic job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| in trying to find the most efficient way to use our federal dollars to fund these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| But the reality of it is, is the needs exceed what the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| or the needs exceed the money that we have for those federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| And so we fund quite a few, especially teaching positions, special education teaching positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| in the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| And so that's, you know, we have to, you know, when something happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| we have a need that comes down in, say, September, October, whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| The reality of it is, is at times we really just don't have any choice but to add a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| And it may be an unbudgeted position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| So those are just some things to keep an eye on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| And so there's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| This is, and so this is something we really, and we've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| So for ESSER, currently we have $102 million of ESSER funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| dedicated strictly to the four core priorities of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| And those dollars, and again, this is cumulative dollars over a two or three-year span,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| but just keep in mind that these dollars lapse in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| So we'll be out of this money by September of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| And so the question then becomes, well, okay, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| If these are some initiatives that's proven really successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| how do we keep these initiatives going when there's no more federal dollars left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| And so I want to talk about some of those major initiatives that in a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| we may be looking and trying to onboard these into the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| And so, again, these are just some major ones that we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| These, obviously, it's not exhaustive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| So we have tutors, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So elementary, early literacy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| Middle school math speaks to the foundational skills, our first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| And then we have high school tutors that speak to credit recovery success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| So hopefully these tutors, this work will prove to be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| We hope and expect it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| And so we want to be really careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| If it is, then we need to try to find a way to continue some of these initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| going forward after the federal dollars have lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Technology, student and staff devices, a couple of years we embarked on the one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| And so, so far, while we've actually paid some of that in fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| the bulk of that so far we've been able to cover with ESSER dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| But, again, those are going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| We invested really heavily in interactive panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| So I talked with our IT folks and said, hey, if we didn't have any of this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| and we had just a replacement cost for both of these items, what are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| And it's like, eh, probably eight to nine million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| So it's pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Some of these are costs that, you know, these are not insignificant initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| that we will be having to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And so more major ESSER initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| obviously we've invested heavily in counselors in college and career advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| I think this speaks to like our third priority, career empowerment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| Mental health supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| We've been able to increase our partnership with Helen Ross McNabb, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| to try to address some of these mental health supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| There's a host of other things that we're doing there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| But we know that over the years we've seen how critical and vital addressing this need is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3433)|
| 0:57:19| Teacher leader supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Again, it points to effective educators, you know, or great educators in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3441)|
| 0:57:27| And so there's some pathways there that we put into ESSER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| And then we also have a significant amount of professional development we've invested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| department chair stipends and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| And so also we talked about the textbook adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| how we want to be able to at some point get this into the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| So I'll talk to their C&I folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I think the next one on, the next adoption is math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| We've kind of bought some time, right, for the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| because the state's kind of had some things going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| So I'll talk to their C&I folks and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| hey, can you give me a rough estimate of what we may be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Because we want to bring this into the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| At some point we're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| And this is what they told me, $7 million to $14 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And I said, well, boy, that's a big range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Well, again, it depends on, you know, if you do a full adoption, do you do a partial adoption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| What materials do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| So it's kind of a broad range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| But anyway, those are just some of the major ones that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| And we're not, you know, again, we're not saying we do one thing, we don't do another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| We're just saying these are some of the items that we are being forced to look at down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| with regards to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| So anyway, that's kind of a really fast way to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| But we wanted to be transparent on what we thought the costs were, what we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| But we also wanted full disclosure in some of the things that we're grappling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| from a cost perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| And we'll open this up to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| If I can't answer it, I may yield to Dr. Adams or Anna Parson or Doug Shover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| if we get into some, you know, how some of the schools were placed into the different priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3542)|
| 0:59:11| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I know that not just you, but a ton of people have poured into this presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| and really studied and done the analysis and looked at all the different angles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| and appreciate you bringing some perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| I mean, everything in education finance is a tradeoff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Nobody ever gets everything that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| It's just not the way it works, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Yeah, and you've been in this business long enough to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| So I want to paint a picture for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Can any of us imagine a vibrant, healthy elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3581)|
| 0:59:48| where kids are learning, enjoying life, that the culture is right without a playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3588)|
| 0:59:57| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| I can't imagine that space, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Like, I think the assumption by most people is, no, elementary schools and preschools, like, need playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| I think that's the assumption, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| And there's also a wide body of research that speaks to the connection between play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| and kids taking breaks cognitively to be able to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| And some of our priorities in Knox County Schools right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| is excellence in foundational skills and success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| I'm going to send a body of research that I've been gathering and correlating to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| but one quote from this says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Outdoor play provides the opportunity to improve sensory integration skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| These activities involve the child as an active participant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| that address motor, cognitive, social, and linguistic domains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Viewed in this light, school recess becomes an essential part of a child's day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| It is not surprising that countries that offer more recess to young children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| see greater academic success among the children as they mature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Supporting and implementing recess not only sends a message that exercise is fundamentally important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| for physical health, but likely bring together children from diverse backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| to develop friendships as they learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| And that's from a report that I will send you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| Also, state law says that children in elementary school have to have 130 minutes per week of break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| and that's not counting physical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| It's not counting walking through hallways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Like, they have to have a break for at least 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| which the default in elementary school, the assumption is you would be doing that on a playground, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| So we have a state law that's also saying, hey, kids need this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| When I first came on the board, one of the very first things I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| was I went around to different schools throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| and one of the schools that I went to was Chilhowee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| It was the very first school that I went to, and we just, at the principal for a day presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| we got, and the first thing she did, the principal there, actually, she showed me the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| She said, Can you believe this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| And I'm like, Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Like, I've had kids at that point in Knox County schools for 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| and had never been a part of a playground fundraising campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Thank goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Hadn't had to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| And she said, Look at this playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| We're going to have to raise the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| And at that principal for a day, she just shared that, Hey, they hit that $60,000 goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| but it took three years to do it, the prices increased twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| and the kids who helped raise that money are never going to play on that playground, likely, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| Many of those kids won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| I have built two playgrounds in my nonprofit work for the village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| So the village is a community for low-income families, single moms and their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| and there's two playgrounds at that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| I can't imagine having built that neighborhood and asking those families to build that playground, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| Like, I can't imagine asking those 24 low-income families to, Hey, here's this great neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| and if your kids want to play, go sell some pizza, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Like, I just can't imagine doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| And to me, the question for us as a board isn't should we have playgrounds or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| I think everybody would be like, Well, no, we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| To me, it's like, Well, whose responsibility is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| Is it the community's responsibility or is it ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| And that's to me kind of like my ultimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| And I know there's competing interests, but to me it feels like this is something that should be our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| because it does put an undue burden on communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| I noticed that one of the schools in the list was Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Is this the one that's in level one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Is that the Lonsdale school we're building, that we built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| I may have to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3809)|
| 1:03:40| I guess my question is we don't currently fund dollars for playgrounds at new schools, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| So we're about to build a Northwest elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| We just built a Lonsdale school, and we're going to build those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| and then we're going to rezone it and tell people you're going to this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| And by the way, if you want a playground, you've got to raise money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| That's kind of how it works, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| So I don't know what the history of this is in KCS schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I've not been able to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| I've been asking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| I don't know if at some point we were in the playground business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| I don't know what other districts are doing across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| But when we do build a playground, it does become the property of the school district, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| So we're asking communities to build assets that Knox County Schools owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| and then we are not going to maintain them, basically, is the current position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| I'm not saying this in this way to fault anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| I'm just trying to, like, put the reality out there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| Like we're asking communities to build playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| and then we're going to say to them we're not going to repay them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| or we're not going to replace them or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| So are the good schools, and I don't know if you all would know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| the good schools in District 1, are those at the community schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| Do we know those four or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| I have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| We could get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Another question I would be curious about is have you looked at those schools based on poverty level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| in a particular zip code of that school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| Because I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| This assessment was basically on if the playground is compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| So the reason I think that's an interesting question is 73% of those priority Level 1 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| are in District 1 and 2, which are our highest poverty districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| And so it makes sense to me that those would be at Level 1 and 73%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| because likely those schools have not been able to, within their own communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| bring that up to par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| And there's lots of ways to look at poverty levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| I would be interested in seeing that exact same table that you just put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| based on free and reduced lunch on those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| and I think that's probably a number that we could easily pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| What I would like to try to figure out as a school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| I know there's lots of reasons and lots of competing interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| What I would like to try to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| is there a way we can do this and take this burden off the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| And I appreciate, Ron, all the work that you did to show that there's three different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| in you all's minds, and I think there's probably some creative energy we can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| to try to move that down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| But at the end of the day, what we're talking about for ongoing cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| is $21.74 per student per year at 587,000 based on 27,000 elementary students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| So right now, we fund at a minimum per student per year, 5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| and it gets up to 15 depending on the school, somewhere in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Right, Ron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| So we're talking about taking $22 out of $5,000 a year per student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| elementary school student, at a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| which is one-tenth, and then the total, the 580,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| is one-tenth of 1% of our total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| I guess what I'm saying is I hear that there's competing interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| but to me, the ongoing cost is not a huge amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| It's not a huge amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Mr. McPherson, what's our current fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| Probably around $69 million, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| $69 million, and what roughly is the percentage of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Probably about 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| 12%, and the state requires us to keep 3%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| So we are in a really healthy position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| and I know that we're not always going to be in a healthy position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| but I do know that for at least 20 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| because what I've heard is that this shifted in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| maybe 30 years, for 30 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| I think we've unintentionally burdened our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| by asking them to take care of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| something that I think we all fundamentally agree is needed in elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| but we're also passing that burden on to our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| and I don't think it's any one person's deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| I mean, I get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| but I also think that there's opportunities that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| also being in philanthropy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| every community has a limited amount of fundraising capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Every community does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| It doesn't matter if you live in Farragut or if you live in Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Every community has a limited opportunity for fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| and some communities have significantly more limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| in terms of capacity of fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| and I think we're asking communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| and putting an undue burden on communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| for something that I think we think is fundamentally needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| and Dr. Roswick, I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| I mean, in your role, in the same, in my role at the Restoration House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| I've got to be looking out five years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Like, I've got to try to understand what are all the levers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| I think as a representative of the school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| in particular my district, which my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| there was only one school on that particular list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| Cedar Bluff Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| now I only have five in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| I think I have the least amount of schools out of any district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| but I think as a school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| it's trying to, you know, part of my responsibility is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| you know, how do we help meet those needs of those families?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| And I think it is something that's expected that kids would have access to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| but I think we're unburdening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| we're burdening our students and our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| My question was about the fund balance also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| I would not be in favor of adding this to the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| I think with the amount of, or with the short asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| life of the asset, I don't think that makes sense to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| And as Mr. Watson said, $587,000 a year is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| it's a small percentage of our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| so I don't think it makes sense to add to the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| And I know over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| you've been moving some things out of capital into general purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| so I don't think that should be on the table at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| And so we have a healthy fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| so if we're going to do it, I think now may be the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| I do think that there are a lot of things competing with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| so I think that I appreciate you going through that long list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| because as we're thinking about anything and everything that comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| it's that same pot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| So anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| I echo the remarks that have already been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| and thank you for the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| I, too, wanted to know, I wanted to know the 11 schools' names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| as in priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| We can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| I don't have them offhand, but we can send that out fairly timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| And seeing that, if my memory is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| I see six that are in Region 5, but five of those were in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| And so I really echo what Mr. Watson has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4254)|
| 1:11:02| and also I think that if we already have kids in those playgrounds right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4262)|
| 1:11:11| and they're on school property, that's a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| That's a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| It's not just a financial liability if someone gets hurt and what we'd have to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| but it's a liability that someone can get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| So I think that when you say that you have over 30 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| that have need for improvement on the playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| you're talking about you have 30 schools that have liability that we know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| that kids can get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| So my concern is the health and safety of our kids as well as their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| So I think that we need to address this as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| So, Mr. McPherson, can you tell me what our monthly payroll is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4323)|
| 1:12:11| It's probably looking between $35 and $40 million, maybe, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| So in speaking of fund balance, right, and I know you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| It's not quite two months of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Right, but it's not more than two months of payroll, I guess is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| It's less than two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| And my other question, and I don't know if this is for you, Dr. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| but as far as safety goes, we do inspections, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| at those playgrounds every year in structures that are not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| We do not allow children to play on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Yes, Madam Chair, we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| and Adam can actually speak to the work we actually do to the playgrounds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4371)|
| 1:13:05| So we inspect every playground every two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| and then we'll send the inspection to the school administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| and our maintenance department as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| and maintenance will automatically generate a work order for anything that needs to be corrected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| and go out and correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| So the schools on priority one are not necessarily not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| You could have landed in that priority because we can't get a replacement part for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| So if something were to break or malfunction, we'd have to remove it opposed to replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| So it doesn't necessarily mean that it's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Adam, can you speak to why we have so much difficulties with replacements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| about them not making the parts anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Well, over time, I mean, companies go out of business, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| and if playground company A goes out of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| you can't purchase a replacement part for playground company B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| because they are not going to touch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| They want you to buy a complete new system, and, I mean, there's just no way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| So, I mean, if we have to remove a broken step from a platform, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| to maintain ADA compliance, that whole structure may have to be removed and blocked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| So it's, I mean, there are schools on priority one that have just some minor issues like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| but they're not unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| I just want to point out some of the, we haven't used the word disparity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| but when we're looking at two of my schools where one of them took three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| to raise $10,000 for a swing set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| and another one had a foundation that raised $400,000 in that same amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| that's something we need to consider when we're looking at school-to-school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| and whether they have the same quality of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| Because if we put all of it on the community to raise the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| we have one school that can raise $400,000 in the same amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| that another can raise $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| And those students don't have the same opportunity to use that different kind of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| It's vastly different from school-to-school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| I don't want to use the word, Mr. McPherson, I don't want to use the word savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| but that's the only word I know to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Do we know what the savings is for this year so far based on our unfilled positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4535)|
| 1:15:45| I don't. I don't know if Scott has that at his fingertips or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| We would have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| I know that traditionally when we do have savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| what we find is at the end of the year a lot of times we'll use those savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| to fund potential overages or overages from unexpected costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| So that's really served us well, that employee turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| in order to be able to address other needs that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| And then potentially when we've had to utilize dollars out of the fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| then we utilize those savings to replenish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| So we could probably come up with something on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| My thinking is that some of that would be rolling over into that fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| and so it might be larger than we have considered so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| The other thing I wanted to talk about briefly is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| when we're talking about no, they're not unsafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| we need to also realize that that piece of equipment is also not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| So some schools are adding equipment, and others it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| oh yeah, we can't find those parts, take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| And so they're seeing their playground get smaller and smaller and less and less day by day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| I think everyone in the room would agree in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| We want playgrounds for kids, we want to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Obviously the question is cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| I would agree with Ms. Horne about capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| I certainly don't want to fund on interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I'm an appreciating asset like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| The question I have is, would we be able to kind of combine that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| So think about using fund balance and seeking partnerships with other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| Could we begin the process, or is there a way to authorize the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| of seeking some partnerships just to see, you know, is there, you know, Commissioner Jasey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| could we get some county funds, would they be willing to help us with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| the initial replacement costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Could we talk to city council and get some, you know, funds from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| to help with some of the initial costs of getting them, you know, up to standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| Could we begin that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Is there a way we can see what money might be available for us before we make the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| Let's say we don't want to spend the full five, whatever, maybe six million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| and we don't feel like we want to take that out of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Could we begin the process of looking to see what other funds are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| and then maybe that number now goes, you know, once we get costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| now that number is three or two million, and it's maybe more easily done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4693)|
| 1:18:22| And I do believe, and Mr. McPherson, maybe you could speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| So the county commission had designated $400,000, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| that schools could apply for in grants, and it could go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| I don't think it was limited to playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| but that is something that I could be supportive of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| maybe some one-time funding and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| letting schools apply in the form of grants and maybe making the schools that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| the highest need schools get priority on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| That would be a thought as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| I don't know if you could speak to that, the way they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| So that, right, that was a grant policy, and it wasn't written into the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| It was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| You know, I kept hearing $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| The deadline for application has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| They did receive quite a number of applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| and I think there is a selection committee made up of some representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| from both the county and the school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| and I think they're reviewing those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| So there is a precedent, I guess, is where you're going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| Just throwing that out there as a possible option too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| without committing to something for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| without really knowing, you know, what's going to happen with the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Adam, just a quick question and comment, maybe you can speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| I think part of what you were describing about not finding parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| part of that is the challenge in the way that we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| in that I think each school is basically seeking out vendors on their own, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| Like if they're going to build a new playground or add stuff, they're seeking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Now, I'm sure they have to go through some kind of procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| but we probably have many vendors represented at different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Is that probably fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| We have three vendors on term contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Okay, so there's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| There's only three that they can use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| If we were to take this on as a school district instead of making it school by school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| do you think the right approach would still be to have three, or could we go to one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if you're only using one vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| the likelihood of you being able to get parts might be greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Now, there's risk in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Well, I mean, the companies now, I mean, they're all reputable companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| It's been around for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| I mean, you would eliminate a lot of choice by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Yeah, so what I was thinking is there was many vendors, but there's only three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| I don't think that presents any type of barrier to anything or makes things more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| I think another opportunity when we talk about partnerships is also philanthropic partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| So, I mean, Randy Boyd just wrote a check for $650,000 for one school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| I think there's an opportunity to combine some public-private dollars for this initial lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| because we're talking about an initial lift and ongoing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Now, if I was being asked, I don't have $650,000, but if I was being asked to invest in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| I would want to have some reinsurance from the school system that you're going to maintain my investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| And so, to me, that's kind of the trick is, like, if we raise and pull this initial lift from community resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| philanthropic, and also other public dollars, can we make that commitment as a school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| And I know Commissioner Jay was just referenced a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| I think he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| I'd like to see if you would come up, Commissioner Jay, and just speak to anything from a commission standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4911)|
| 1:22:01| Thank you very much, and thank you all for the opportunity to come up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| I hadn't planned on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| I was just sort of jotting some notes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| But I want to bring a little bit of context to why I'm involved with this altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| I'm in a different legislative position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| You know, I'm on one side of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| You guys are on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| But it really started several years ago when I was contacted and asked if I would help raise some money for Pond Gap Elementary and their playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4940)|
| 1:22:30| And I did, and I personally wrote a check and raised a little bit of funds, and they were really close to their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| And then soon after, Mount Olive contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Carson Daly and I work closely together on many initiatives, and Mount Olive reached out, and they were much farther away from their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4958)|
| 1:22:47| I helped them put together a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| I, again, wrote a personal check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| My wife and I raised some other funds, went to several major donors, got to close the gap, and got that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| And then I think the word got out, and so other schools started calling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| I visited and spent some time with Westview Elementary School and helped secure some funds, which turned into a big purple slide, which is really cool if you haven't been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4982)|
| 1:23:11| And then I got a contact from Brandy at Sunnyview Primary and went out there and said this might be the saddest playground I've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=4991)|
| 1:23:22| I mean, really, I went out to Sunnyview, and I think close to half of the playground had been removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| because Knox County Schools will certainly inspect them, and they will certainly condemn them, and then they will remove the pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| What was left was rusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| There were several pieces of metal rope thing that were exposed that were dangerous, quite frankly, and it was on a fast downhill slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5018)|
| 1:23:48| And so it was a little bit of a walking path, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| It was just amazing to me, and that's when I think it was that third or fourth school I kept asking, okay, well, is this a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Much like your comments, like why isn't this a basic part of elementary education and facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| And everyone kept citing the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| Oh, there's a policy that Knox County doesn't fund schools, and so of course I'm incredibly persistent sometimes, and there's a fine line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5052)|
| 1:24:22| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| But I kept saying, okay, show me the policy, show me the policy, and of course nobody could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| And what ultimately I discovered, like many of you, is it just became a practice, probably a tough budget year, and the school sort of said it's on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5067)|
| 1:24:37| And that just really, it just amazed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| It amazed me that as I looked more and more at the schools that are in the hardest economic neighborhoods, the playgrounds were worse and worse and worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5080)|
| 1:24:51| and we are asking these children, these families, and these communities to play on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| I've asked many times, you know, would we enact the same policy if a basketball, the roof fell in on the basketball court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| Would we say, you know, great, I appreciate that, but you all have to raise money to put a new roof on if you want to play basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| No, we just wouldn't do that, and why isn't this part of the basic education of all of the things that we know that are of value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5110)|
| 1:25:18| I pledged to Sunnyview that I would do my best to raise awareness of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| I started to come talk to many of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| I committed to them that I would raise money for them and I would give personally, and then with amazing humility, they said, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5125)|
| 1:25:36| Chilhowee Intermediate is really close to their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| If you would please help them first and put us second, we think that that is a greater need, and so I went over to Chilhowee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| I thought Sunnyview was the worst playground I ever saw, and then I visited Chilhowee Intermediate, and they were close to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| I think they were about $8,500 away from their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| You'd heard that this goal had been stretched many times because it just, it took so long, and so I committed all of my commissioner funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5155)|
| 1:26:04| I wrote a check personally, went out and raised a little bit more money, and we got them over the goal, and they are installing that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| Eighty percent of the children at Chilhowee Intermediate today will never, that raise the money for this, will never set foot on that playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5171)|
| 1:26:19| and it just amazed me as I continued to ask more questions that it wasn't just about new playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| It was about basic maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| If a school needs mulch, the school has to raise money for mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| Kids have to sell pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| They have to do car washes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| They have to do coupon books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| I have drawers full of coupon books that I buy every year from as many kids who will ask me that I never use because it's so important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| but it just baffled me, and so I would sort of take a step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| First, I want to say thank you to Ron, to everybody on the team who did do an assessment, who did go back and look and try to sort of grasp this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5208)|
| 1:26:58| What I think is before you is not necessarily one particular budget number or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| It's a philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| It's a culture shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| For 30 years, we have said to the entire community, much less the poorest parts of our community, it's all on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5227)|
| 1:27:15| If you want this thing, it's on you, and we haven't provided for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| and so I would just challenge you to think, is this a way we can shift the culture and the mindset of this school board and this community to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5239)|
| 1:27:29| this is vital and this is important, and these will help with kids that have energy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| Well, every kid has an energy issue, but focus, reading, breaks, healthiness, happiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| Teachers having an opportunity to take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| We should do the basic maintenance at the bare minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| Right now, I would just ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Just somehow create a policy or create a culture that says, from this point forward, whatever we have right now, let's just take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5272)|
| 1:28:01| Let's not have kids selling pizzas and coupon books just to pay for mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| Then we'll figure out the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| I really appreciate the presentation and the work that's gone into it, but this is a presentation of 37 reasons why we shouldn't do this and no reasons of can we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5287)|
| 1:28:17| How do we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| I love the ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| County Commission, we have put a fund together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Can we do more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| There's private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| There's a lot of different ways, but it has to start with sort of a willingness of, is this a vital part of our school system, and if it is, how can we achieve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5303)|
| 1:28:31| How can we do it over a year or two years or three years or four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| There's always going to be competing priorities, but sometimes when things are good, you catch up, and we've got about 20 or 30 years of catching up to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5315)|
| 1:28:43| and I would just encourage you to say, if we want to, as a board, figure it out, let's put that as part of our culture and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5323)|
| 1:28:51| Come to Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| I promise you, at least you'll have one champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| I'm one of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| You'll have two because Carson Daly is right there with me, and come to us and say, how can we pull this off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| There are incredibly generous people in this community that will step up to the plate, but it's got to start with an ideology of this is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| and it should be part of our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| So thanks for the opportunity, and thanks for the work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Thank you for the challenge, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| Board members, speaking of Commissioner Daly, everybody has a copy of this email, right, Ms. Cotten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5355)|
| 1:29:23| Okay, so Mr. Daly did send an email today, and if you could forward that to board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5363)|
| 1:29:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| So any other discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| Can you speak to what Commissioner Daly said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| Actually, yeah, I can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| The purpose for writing this email is to ask that the board adopt the same grant program as Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| Knox County has $400,000 in matching grants for schools in the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| Several elementary schools have applied for this grant and maybe two high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| For a PTO or PTA to raise funds for a large project would mean that the amount could be cut in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5406)|
| 1:30:13| Smaller schools can benefit greatly with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| We would add the same amount of $400,000 for the Knox County grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| So basically he's asking us to match what the county has put in, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| But I can have Ms. Cotten forward that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| So with no other discussion, we will move on to our next item, which is discussion on legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5438)|
| 1:30:47| Ms. Owen, would you like to take the lead on this, or would you like for me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| I can say I was assuming somebody else was doing that since I didn't put it on here, but I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| I would start by saying TSBA sent out today their list of legislative agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5461)|
| 1:31:10| the priorities, their position statements, and quite a bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| So since that came out just this afternoon, I've copied those for you, and you should have those at your place also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| So we can refer to those if we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Ms. Cotten also has our legislative priorities from 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| And then I believe there are a couple of suggestions for additions here from other board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| And I guess I should speak a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| So when adding this to the agenda, I think we voted on it in January last year, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| I just wanted to make sure everyone was thinking ahead and we didn't get to January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| and Ms. Cotten not have anything or everybody be kind of like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| we need to come into January knowing or having a good idea, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| And I had said that I would bring it to policy review, but I had flu, so that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| That was unfortunate. Yeah, unfortunate timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| So again, that's why this is on here, just as a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| And so everybody can review what is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| If there are other things that we would like to see added, certainly need to be sent to Ms. Cotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| so that we can kind of have a cohesive document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| And that's a good starting point coming into our January meeting, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| that's why I thought it might be a good idea to put it on tonight so we can at least have an initial discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5562)|
| 1:32:50| It might be good to also take a look at the second page of our priorities from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| regarding academic and retention decisions so that when we get to that discussion later in next week's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5577)|
| 1:33:07| we can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| All right. So any other questions or discussions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5592)|
| 1:33:22| Should the members who brought these other suggestions discuss those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| Would either of you like to speak on this or just—it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| I'll just say I'm one of the members who brought two suggestions forward for parents' rights and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| So I did send those to Ms. Cotten this afternoon, so you do have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| But Ms. Cotten, if you don't mind sending those to the board as well so they can look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| and we can talk about those when we have this discussion and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| I think those are some important things to maybe look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Ms. Bight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| And I think as far as this on the suggestions with Dr. Norton's third grade retention suggestions or wording changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5646)|
| 1:34:16| I don't really know exactly how that would be paired in, especially because I am so new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| But I did have a lot to talk about later on down, so I don't know exactly how that should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5662)|
| 1:34:29| We're not voting on this until January, so if you want to discuss it now or later in the agenda, it's completely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5669)|
| 1:34:40| I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| You want to just wait? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| All right, let me find—I've got a lot of stuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Let me find my agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5690)|
| 1:34:57| Okay, so moving into our regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5697)|
| 1:35:06| Consent agenda, items 5A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| Any questions or concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| This was actually something for West High School football team that required action last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| And congratulations to West High, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| That's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| I know, Ms. Bight, you're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Did you want to speak to that, Gary or John or Sarah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| It was just to use UT's facility, right, for their practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| So moving into items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| D1 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| D2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5756)|
| 1:36:04| 5 or 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| 7 or 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| I had one on 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| Could someone speak to the services with SWAN Educational Solutions for the charter school applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| I'm confused about why we're considering that contract, since that's not something that came up during Ms. Fivish's presentation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5784)|
| 1:36:35| I'm Kathy Dugan, and I work with Julie Thompson, the Director of Academic Supports, to support and monitor the charter schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| And we haven't had charter school applications since Emerald came on in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5803)|
| 1:36:51| And so now we have two charter school applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| We have two letters of ‑‑ well, we don't have the applications yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| We have the letters of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| One is from a school in Chattanooga that's wishing to replicate, and the other one is from a local group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| The one in Chattanooga is a K through 5 school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| It would be Knoxville Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| It's an all boys school, 6 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| And the other one is a K through 5 school that's got a philosophy base, and it's an early literacy ‑‑ emphasis on early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5837)|
| 1:37:28| And since we have ‑‑ we put ‑‑ knowing that we would have some new applications this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| we put some money into our charter school budget to cover the cost of a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| We don't have the ‑‑ we don't feel that we have the experience within our authorizing group to, you know, run an application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5860)|
| 1:37:49| It's hundreds and hundreds of hours, collective hours, of editing documents once the review team looks at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5869)|
| 1:37:58| And so we really feel like we need an expert to support us in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| I appreciate that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| It concerns me that you don't feel like you have the experience on the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| because it was my understanding that part of building that team to review applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| was to build a team of people who could adequately evaluate charter school applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5901)|
| 1:38:29| We have the experience on the team to evaluate the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| It's the piece where you take all of the documents that the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| all of the application documents and compile them into one document so that we present them to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| We don't have anyone who has actually done that work before in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| So this is someone who is ‑‑ she was the director of charter schools for Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| Her name is Carol Swan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| And she does these application reviews for other systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| She's worked with Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| She's worked with Memphis and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| And she's a regular consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Her job is to run these application processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| Many school systems contract with outside consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| because it's the time that it takes to put them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| probably more than the expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I probably misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| I would say, too, Cathy, to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| that when you look at our charter policy and the folks that make up that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| they're not all on‑staff people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| So we have parent representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| We have community representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| So we have parent representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| We have community representatives as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| who would not be previous participants in a process like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| And because we are largely using a state rubric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| those tools to assess those applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| my understanding from Julie is this is kind of a required piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| we have to have everybody up to speed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| I guess my question then would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| if there's a format that we need to be able to present it to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| why aren't we requiring that the applicants compile that information in that format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| before they present it to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Again, I'm new to charter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| My understanding is that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| there is a set of required things that they have to include in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| There's also a rubric that the state provides for the assessing body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| to look at those applications to see if they have included the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| at the level and capacity that they are supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| so that they can then make a recommendation to the board based on that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| And I would be happy to send you a copy of the rubric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| and the application materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| so you can see what the team will be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| and how they'll be looking at the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| Kathy, another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| You mentioned the name of one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| Are you able to mention the—I haven't heard of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| The second school, it's a group called Lifelong Learning Collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| Lifelong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Lifelong Learning—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Lifelong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| No, Lifelong Learning Collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Learning Collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| And they want to start a school called an academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| It's going to be substantially smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| It's going to be a K-8 school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| And it's a group of philosophers for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| philosophy professors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| and they're very interested in incorporating philosophy principles into early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6104)|
| 1:41:51| And another emphasis is smaller class sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| So we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| We don't have—we don't know as much about them as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| Since Chattanooga Prep is seeking to replicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| so we'll be interested to see what they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| And I have a contractual question too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| I think by memory, I think it's $8,500 or so for the contract for Ms. Swan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| Is that per application or is that total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| It's $9,500 for both applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| We asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| We were worried about that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| And we actually got her to reduce her contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| Initially she had quoted us a higher amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| And since $9,500 was all that we had allocated from our charter funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| she agreed to do it for $9,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| So we feel like we're getting a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| So is it reasonable to say that if we were looking, let's say, at five applications this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| that rate would have been more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| She said that, well, we're not going to get any more because today was the deadline for the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| I'm trying to think from a board member's perspective, future budgetary costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| and I'm trying to get a sense of do consultants base this on per application, this type of contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| or are they saying for this period of time, this season of applications, it's one fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| She's doing it for a season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| It's a project fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| So if she has one application or five, that's her fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| So not based on per application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| So if this is for these two, when we come around next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| it will be a completely different total if there are more applications next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| We might not get a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| We might budget a little bit more money knowing that her fee is higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| She reduced her fee this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| But it would still be one fee per however many applications we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| Like if we have one application or we have five, it will be the same amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| whatever she quotes us next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| And then anything that you are sending to the other board members, a rubric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| and any other materials would you mind also sending to me or to all of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| I'll send them to Ms. Coatney, and she can get those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Dr. Rasfoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| Yeah, I just want to say first, Kathy, thanks for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| I mean, there's a lot to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| and a lot of different entities from the state involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| So I'm just going to say this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Typically what has happened in other larger districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| when there are multiple charters that come on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| their department tends to grow with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| So she referenced Carol Swan in Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| There's a team of people who run and monitor those on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| So I would imagine, I mean, we start talking about three, four, five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| but obviously at some point we'd have to have staff help manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| and do some of those kinds of things if that came to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| So there probably wouldn't be a need, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| if this became a regular practice for us to do that over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| I mean, right now our charter support consists of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| who does an amazing job on a part-time basis for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| and then working with Ms. Thompson as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| So you kind of build your capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| and kind of move off contract at some point probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| Right, because right now our charter fee doesn't allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| to fund a full charter office like other systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| And as we get more charter schools, that number will increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| and that's an idea down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| Ms. Selwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| For clarification, it says that the cost is up to $9,500 plus travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6344)|
| 1:45:52| Should that say including?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| No, it is plus travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| And where is she traveling from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| She's traveling from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| and she will probably only come over once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| for the initial application review team training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| and then the rest of the meetings will be virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| But Julie talked to several people and consulted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| and we felt that the best way was for her to meet everyone in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| at least one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| Okay, and my last question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| is it possible to have the charter applicants pay any part of this cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Each applicant submits a $2,500 application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| And so some of the money can come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| All right, so anything else on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| Okay, still under items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| Item 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| 8 or 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| Mr. Dupler, on 9 and 10, is there any issue on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| I don't think you had signed those on those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| These are some of those contracts where we've tried to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| an arrangement where it's the best wording for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| These companies aren't willing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| I know there was one I worked on this month based out of New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| and they weren't going to change from their New York law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| So, you know, in that case, I'm not going to sign it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| because it's not a preferred contract wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| but the board could still approve it should the board so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| I mean, I understand that these students, these parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| these teachers may want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| But what I would tell them is, you know, if the board approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| it's kind of a take or leave it type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| So if anything major happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| then they'll have to do whatever that company says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| according to those terms of that contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| because it's not something that we can go to New York and fight, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| So from our discussion during the agenda set meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6504)|
| 1:48:32| the parents and schools will be at a risk for losing that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| should something come up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| Like with the safety patrol trips when COVID hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| Yeah, that's probably the best example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| I mean, normally it would have to be something, you know, radical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| I would also say that if a parent and student pays their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| and for some reason they can't go, then they're probably out the money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| I mean, you know, but as long as everybody understands that up front, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| and says, oh, yeah, I want this opportunity to go to New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| and play at Carnegie Hall or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| I mean, I know there's something similar to that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Then, okay, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| But you have to understand you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| It may not work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| You may lose your money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| So, Dr. Wilson, our principals, have they informed these course teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| or would they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Because we'd want to make sure that parents understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| We can certainly make sure that that is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| I think probably from Gary's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| I'd like to have a little bit of language on exactly where the issue lay in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| I knew he was waiting on some contractual things to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| and make that final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| But, yeah, we would be happy to provide that in terms of guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| So, moving on to Item 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6594)|
| 1:50:01| Item 11 or 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| Item 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| I'm wondering why we have documentation pending for something that's on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| What's up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| Sure, I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| On this particular one, we were trying to provide the maximum time available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| to reach an agreement with the City of Knoxville for the use of the recreation space at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| We're very close to getting an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| but I learned today that there is disagreement on one issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| so this will be coming off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| So, moving on to Board Policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Item 6A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| I got to come to the last policy review, but I had to leave due to a family emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| so I didn't get to stick around for all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| and don't remember that I don't think I was part of the discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| On B-140, it's in line 27, the part of the sentence that will be striked with public notice of such agenda-setting meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6682)|
| 1:51:34| So it looks like the policy would change from not public noticing when the agenda-set meetings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6694)|
| 1:51:41| Can somebody just share the thought process behind that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| I don't know how often the public takes advantage of that to come to those or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| Ms. Horne, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| Sure. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| So I ask that this be redlined because my experience was when I was Board Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| there were times when we would have an agenda-set meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| and if media is there, whatever is on the agenda could be discussed on the news or in the media prior to the agenda being published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6725)|
| 1:52:17| which means prior to Board members being made aware of what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| So the policy still states that Board members can attend these meetings and just observe, not participate to observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6741)|
| 1:52:30| It just would be that the media would not be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| It wouldn't be public notice, so the media would not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| Because that was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| Of course, we were dealing with a lot of big things then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| and my concern was that it would be in the media before Board members had any idea what was coming on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6763)|
| 1:52:52| So the intent, I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| And also, the other thing was just really for the flexibility of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| You have to have 48 hours for public notice, and I think Ms. Christie talked about this in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| That was an issue when I was the Chair also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| I don't have strong feelings about it either way, but I can tell you just from being Board Chair, there have been times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| like you mentioned having to leave policy review because you had a family emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| And there have been times, I think people know that we've had some significant health issues in my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| that we have public notice something, and it has created a hardship to keep that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6807)|
| 1:53:36| And with the Chair having to be there and the Superintendent having to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| you can't just say, oh, we need to do this an hour earlier so I can make this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| But again, I don't really have strong feelings about it either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6826)|
| 1:53:53| but I can tell you that life happens and things come up, and sometimes having that flexibility is helpful in those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6833)|
| 1:54:03| I didn't really want to ask for this when I was the Board Chair, but I thought about it several times when I was the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6843)|
| 1:54:10| And there were also occasions when if we needed to have a work session, a quarterly work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6850)|
| 1:54:18| it may be that we could do that on the phone, on a 10-minute phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| And so rather than public noticing the meeting and coming here and going through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6864)|
| 1:54:31| you really wouldn't do that with a work session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| But if you do a quarterly meeting, that's usually like, okay, we're going to cover these two agenda items or these two different presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6876)|
| 1:54:44| You can literally do that in a 5- or 10-minute phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| So those were the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Yeah, I appreciate the rationale, and I totally get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| To me, the purpose of that meeting is for planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| and everything's still going to come out in public notice, and then people can comment and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| And it sounds like the intent, and I'm assuming, Mr. Dupler, that this is kosher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| is that the intent then would be, like Ms. Warren said, that Board members could still attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| but because they're just observing and they're not discussing, then it would not need to be public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| even in the event of multiple Board members coming, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| There's a consistent case law that says that observe versus participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| So if Board members are just observing, then they can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| Another example of that in recent memory is when Board members go and tour a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6931)|
| 1:55:37| As long as Board members aren't discussing and are just audience members, so to speak, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| It doesn't have to be public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| But if Board members are participating, it must be public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| While we're looking at the rationale for removing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| I'd like to go back and look at the rationale for why we put it in to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| There was a time when one of our Board members tried to attend this meeting and was told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| And so that's where that came from, and it was before we were on the Board, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| But that person was not allowed to attend that meeting, not allowed to sit, not allowed to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| And we put it in policy so that it would be very clear to everyone that that meeting was open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6981)|
| 1:56:30| that people could come to that meeting, and went that step further of having it noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6990)|
| 1:56:37| And I would also note that there has been a meeting since I've been on the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| that I was told I could not be in the meeting because there was a Board member already in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7002)|
| 1:56:49| And if another Board member attended that meeting, it would have to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| I think this gives some clarity, at least to this one instance, this one meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| to make it very clear that we can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| And having it public noticed, I think that just makes sure we are covered to say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7026)|
| 1:57:14| if someone feels that it's deliberative for us to be listening, then it's open so it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7034)|
| 1:57:26| I feel like if Board members are concerned about not knowing in a certain amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| then they can attend that meeting and they can know at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| So I don't feel it's necessary to remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| I felt very strongly about putting it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| And I can say that I've never attended the agenda-setting meeting because I've never felt the need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| but I felt like anyone who wanted to should be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7073)|
| 1:57:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| I think to ensure the intent of allowing Board members to still attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7083)|
| 1:58:10| it's also important to also put in the policy, and I would probably do it in bullet point seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| that says that the Board secretary will notify Board members, even though it's not publicly noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| that I can't come to a meeting and I don't know that that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| So even if I have the ability to come but I don't know when it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| that's not real helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| So I would ask that before we vote on this that we add a line to section seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| that speaks to the Board being notified by the Board secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7116)|
| 1:58:58| Does anyone need a break or do we want to continue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7138)|
| 1:59:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| Let's take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| I think we have a couple of people needing a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| So we will come back in ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| So moving back into our regular agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| Board members, without objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| Mr. Myers from County Procurement has been sitting in the back of the room most of the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7168)|
| 1:59:35| He's here for item 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| So without objection, I would like to kind of skip to that item and then go back to where we left off, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7178)|
| 1:59:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| So item 9A, which is to approve settlement of $500,000 with Rouse Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7191)|
| 1:59:59| for additional expenses related to the Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| Does anyone have any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7203)|
| 2:00:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| I don't have a specific question, but since Mr. Myers is here, if you would like to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| He has been waiting, so Mr. Myers, would you like to come up and say hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7219)|
| 2:00:35| Director of Procurement for Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| I don't keep the conversation going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| You all have a long night, so if there are no questions with this, it's a simple change order that we were doing for Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| This will close the project out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| The rain we're having this week, we're not going to get that top coat and the striping down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| so we'll get that done just as soon as we can and we'll be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7253)|
| 2:01:00| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| So moving back to board policies, I think we did 6A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7269)|
| 2:01:17| Any concerns with C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| Yes, I have a concern with C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| While it makes sense to move the line about the responsibility to provide information to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| and I appreciate that that is still in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| do we have anywhere else where we have an expectation for principals to develop a public relations and outreach program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7293)|
| 2:01:44| It looks like we're removing the principal's responsibility to engage parents in the community with their programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7304)|
| 2:01:53| so that's a concern to me if it's not somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7313)|
| 2:02:15| Dr. Norton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Yeah, I don't have the policies in front of me at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| Well, no, I have that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| I don't have the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| There is a family and community engagement policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| I think that might be the title of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| But the reason this language was flagged was that it did overlap with another policy that had similar language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| and was more consistent to what the principal's role would be in engaging families versus it being in a media relations policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7361)|
| 2:02:50| But I'd need to look and find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7370)|
| 2:02:59| All right, so item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7379)|
| 2:03:07| E, item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7387)|
| 2:03:13| Item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7393)|
| 2:03:23| Item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| This is a recommended new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| Dr. Wilson, can you just speak to its intent for the public and what's trying to be accomplished here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| So the academic acceleration policy and the new nature of it is driven by state law change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| And we've always had practices, I would say, around how we identified students for honors coursework or advanced coursework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7434)|
| 2:04:02| but it's never been formalized in a policy per this law change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| It requires that we have a policy that speaks to that for students in grades 7 through 12 in subject areas in English, math, and science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7446)|
| 2:04:15| And essentially, the law change has new teeth in it, if you will, around how we communicate that information to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7455)|
| 2:04:23| And so it's really driven by once we know which parameters students will have to follow to become eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| we then communicate that with parents to make sure they're aware that students are eligible for those courses and can enroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| And really kind of the way the law is written suggests that they will be enrolled in those courses unless parents ask for them not to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7476)|
| 2:04:45| The parameters, I would say, too, to kind of clarify a little bit, by law, are required to include state testing data that we have for the TCAP tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7485)|
| 2:04:55| and then also the grades in the coursework that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| And then we're allowed to add some additional points for consideration as far as communicating that eligibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| but it's also not intended to necessarily limit students' access to those courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| So it's really just a matter of having clear guidelines for who we would say is eligible for these courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| but that would not prevent a parent request or a teacher recommendation to push beyond those recommendations to make students have access to those courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7515)|
| 2:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| Item I or J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7530)|

| 2:06:24| B or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| Missed that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| I'm looking at 8C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| In the fiscal note, it says that there's no cost at this time, and that's problematic to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| As a fiscal note, if there's the potential for there to be a future cost, I would expect to see that there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7601)|
| 2:06:51| Dr. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| I'll jump in, and if you need to clean it up, Dr. Wilson, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| So, Miss Owen, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| So, this is part of the procurement at this point has asked us to procure multiple contracts for RFPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| I mean, if that is the case and multiple are awarded, there are times that we don't spend on those, but they back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| So, it takes sometimes four to six months to procure something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| So, if we put an RFP out and we secure those, sometimes we don't use those vendors, but they've been approved to be purchased off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7638)|
| 2:07:25| So, we don't currently have, again, correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Wilson, we don't currently have any spend on those, but we could if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7645)|
| 2:07:32| So, that's why there's not a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| My concern additionally with that is that often we have an agenda item, and the board is told, well, you all already approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7654)|
| 2:07:44| So, now this is just the spending part that we're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| I think when we approve something initially, whatever it is, we should be able to see the potential amount that we would be approving in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| So, whatever these contracts are, if we expect there to be a cost, I would like to see that in the fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7675)|
| 2:08:04| And if there's not a cost because it's just going through this process, here's why this confuses me, because we have the names of the companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7684)|
| 2:08:19| So, if we have the names of the companies, that's different than going through the RFP process when we don't know what the companies are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7699)|
| 2:08:28| and we don't know what the amounts would be, and we don't know what the contracts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| So, if we already have the companies, we already know what we're looking at, the potential cost is what I'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7712)|
| 2:08:41| I appreciate that, Ms. Owen, and I'll have Dr. Wilson speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| I think they're secured contracts, but not necessarily projects yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| So, you're probably better than I am at explaining that, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| Probably only slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| So, I would say that this is, in the past, we have been, I think, encouraged through the procurement process to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7735)|
| 2:09:03| if we think there are entities that we would like to contract or we see the potential that we would do work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| to go ahead and seek out through the RFP process to establish those contracts, whether we are fully planning to execute on those or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7749)|
| 2:09:17| This was a procurement or an RFP that was put out for support for early literacy pieces through the ESSER work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7757)|
| 2:09:24| So, there would be money now, currently, sitting in the ESSER budget that was approved by the board in relation to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| and that's certainly an amount that we could go back and speak to, but these are contracts that span over multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| So, again, that would be, if dollars were earmarked in the future for that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| they would be earmarked in future budget allocations, I would imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| The nature of this contract, as it was written and put through procurement, allowed for multiple fund sources to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| and also allowed for multiple respondents to the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| So, it was not an RFP where one company was awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| but multiple companies were awarded for the possibility of supporting that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| which is why you see multiple companies listed as being awarded under that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| Okay. Mr. Dubler, maybe you can help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| What the item says is approve contracts with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| It doesn't say approve this RFP or accept this group as samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7821)|
| 2:10:29| It says approve contracts with, and then we have this list of contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| So, aren't we saying that we are approving these contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7834)|
| 2:10:42| Yes, yes. I mean, these are contracts that are fully approved through procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| I believe what you're asking, and I don't want to put words in anybody's mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7847)|
| 2:10:54| but, I mean, it sounds like you're asking for an amount like we would put in a term construction contract because we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7854)|
| 2:11:02| We have contracts that are sent through procurement, and then they're approved up to $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| It doesn't mean we're going to spend $500,000, but that's the cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| So, it sounds like that's what you're asking, but, again, I don't want to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| I really don't know what I'm asking because this whole thing looks very confusing to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| because it says that we're approving contracts, but there's no dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| and then we have multiple contracts that appear to be doing somewhat different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| and we're looking at contracts which also may be extended an additional four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7893)|
| 2:11:39| which to me is an additional funding amount that we also don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7899)|
| 2:11:46| So, I need some clarification on what it is that we're actually approving here, and I'm not sure anybody in this room knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7906)|
| 2:11:57| Well, I would say this, that the contracts are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| and if this board and this district wants to use the services of these companies, it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7921)|
| 2:12:09| But what I'm hearing is that Dr. Reiswick and his team haven't decided to use these companies yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7929)|
| 2:12:18| but if they do in the future, I would advise that that project and that amount be brought back to the board to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7938)|
| 2:12:29| Thank you. That makes more sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| I think the language here needs to make that clearer, and if we want to approve this at the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7953)|
| 2:12:44| it needs to clearly say that we're accepting them to be used potentially in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7964)|
| 2:12:53| not that we're accepting these contracts, because that's something very different than what it sounds like we're actually doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7973)|
| 2:13:01| So if we could have some clarity on what we're really doing here before we try to vote on it, that would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7981)|
| 2:13:08| I hate to be more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=7988)|
| 2:13:27| I don't think potential would work, because these contracts would be approved if this board votes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8007)|
| 2:13:35| But there would not be any money approved to actually use the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| So in other words, this form is approved, and the board can use this company and these services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8020)|
| 2:13:49| but the board would still have to put some meat on the bone, so to speak, in the form of some type of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8029)|
| 2:13:57| So then my question would change to why are we approving these now instead of when they would actually be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8037)|
| 2:14:04| I can answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| That goes back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| Only because we have spent so much time, and I'm not in here, so much time and energy working with procurement to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| And Matt left five minutes too early, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| So we've asked that same question, Ms. Owen, over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| I know Mr. McPherson has been part of securing these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| So what ends up happening is when we get a grant, right, or we get a funding source, or we get ESSER that dropped from the sky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8067)|
| 2:14:35| those kinds of things, you know, we have this window to spin down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| But we can't spin down because we have to procure, right, and go through all the processes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| What typically happens, and this is how it plays out in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| So the schools hear about this great training or this great material that they're going to get, and we go, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| it's going to take four to six months, right, because we have to procure it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| So that throws off the training cycles for summer and for all those kinds, and the stuff drops in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| And by that point, they're going on with a full year of doing what they do, and they're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| how come we didn't get this back in the summer when we could have trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| So we've talked with procurement over the course of the last couple years going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| what can we do to be ready if and when dollars drop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| And they say, well, just go ahead and procure all of these potential contracts from vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| If you want an instructional partner, if you want someone who does early literacy skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| like go ahead and do an RFP for all those things so that you have them kind of on retainer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| or whatever, that they're there, even though we may not have dollars for it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| or an individual school may use it or, you know, again, we may get a grant for it and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| That allows us to spend in real time because we have the contracts procured and secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| But to Mr. Duper's point, that would always come in the form of approval of the federal programs budget that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8144)|
| 2:15:51| or the general purpose budget that comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| So there's always still board approval of the dollars that come there or a grant that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8153)|
| 2:15:58| But it's really to try to get that timing right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| And this is what procurements ask us to do, put out RFPs from wherever we say, well, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| We do these kind of autopsies of why did it take so long to get all that stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| It's like, well, you should have had them procured on the front side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| And they're not wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| I mean, that's the process for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| But if we don't have these, then when we have dollars, we can't activate those grants, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| That all does make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| I spent a lot of time with Matt for a couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| So I understand all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| The issue for me might be in the future when these actually come back and somebody says to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8189)|
| 2:16:37| but you have to approve the dollars because you approved the contract back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8197)|
| 2:16:44| And that has happened on multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| When we've had something on the agenda that's, here's this, $8,000, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| and somebody says, well, you have to approve the money part because you approved the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8212)|
| 2:16:58| And nobody can ever explain that, no, we really don't have to approve that money part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| So I think it's important as board members that we're all very cognizant of this so that in the event that this comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8223)|
| 2:17:11| and somebody says, well, you have to approve the money part, we need to remember that, no, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8231)|
| 2:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| And I'll just say from Dr. Oswick and I also spent a great deal of time with Mr. Myers over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8238)|
| 2:17:27| I hate that maybe we shouldn't have bumped him ahead, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| And had that same discussion, you know, and what their frustrations with us are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| Because, I mean, I have heard those frustrations from teachers or schools saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8256)|
| 2:17:42| especially with this or title money, saying, why don't I have this yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8262)|
| 2:17:47| And it always comes back to county procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| And they're like, quit making us the bad guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| You know, you need to do the work on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| You know, I get what you're saying, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| So it's one of those, again, Mr. Myers left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8278)|
| 2:18:05| I don't have a problem with accepting it as here are contracts we could use as long as it's very clear, which it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8285)|
| 2:18:14| but very clear that we're accepting these as contracts that we could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| and that they have to be approved in the future before we can actually use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8297)|
| 2:18:24| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| Is there a possibility, I understand all the sides here, of this being like contract options with the ability to exercise them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8307)|
| 2:18:36| Is there any sort of legal language there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| Because I understand all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| I mean, I think that's what, thank you, Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| And I think that's what Ms. Owens is asking for is some language that says that these are really options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8332)|
| 2:19:00| that these are approved contracts, approved companies, but this board does not have to use these companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8340)|
| 2:19:09| but they're available should the board so choose and should the board approve money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8349)|
| 2:19:15| So, yeah, we can look at the language and come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| And, you know, an option may be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| So any other questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| So 8D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8376)|
| 2:19:45| 8E has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| So moving on to regular agenda items, 9A was Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8388)|
| 2:19:54| He's already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| So 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8396)|
| 2:20:02| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| Madam Chair, on Wednesday I will be asking that we defer this until the January board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8403)|
| 2:20:12| So I would say if we have questions on that, we can wait until January would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8417)|
| 2:20:24| Mr. Dupler, did you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| I was just going to ask Ms. Horn, would you also be asking to defer 8A as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| I realized that when she got to 8E, I was like, oh, I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| But, yes, I will also on Wednesday be asking that we also defer 8E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| which is the design contract for the Fairgate Area Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| So I'll be asking that both of those be deferred until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| Please, which ones were there again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| It will be 8A and 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8454)|
| 2:21:04| So 8A and 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| So when we approve the agenda on Wednesday night, I'll be making a motion that we defer those until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| And both of those are concerning the new Fairgate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| The land purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| Mr. Watson, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| I do have some questions regarding the matter, but if the intent is to postpone, then I'm happy to hold my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8484)|
| 2:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| So 9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8498)|
| 2:21:45| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| When we move this money, do we know what it will be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8509)|
| 2:22:03| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| I'll defer to Ms. Himmelgarn if she wants to have Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8525)|
| 2:22:10| Madam Chair, I'll defer to Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8530)|
| 2:22:21| So it's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| Actually, it's just an entry that's required by accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| So it's not changing the intent of how the money will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| It's just simply how we reflect it on the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| So it's the amount that we are under with the total amount of lease costs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8554)|
| 2:22:41| And most of that is associated with copier leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| And so accountants like to get together and figure out new ways to show things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8564)|
| 2:22:53| So all it is is we're moving it from other leasing into other charges or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| So it's just a requirement that we show the total amount of lease costs that's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| So we're not moving the money to use it in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| So it's not money from lease that was not used that we're moving into a fund that we could use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8588)|
| 2:23:16| We're moving it to simply another line item on the financial statements that's required by accounting requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| We're just renaming it for the fun of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| So this is being driven by the accounting standards changing regarding to leasing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| And that's not just affecting our books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| That's affecting everybody's books who have to get looked at from a third-party auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| Thank you, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| Item 9D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8627)|
| 2:23:57| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Now that the group has been selected or presented for selection, can somebody just speak to the process of selection and how those get determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8640)|
| 2:24:13| Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| Yes, I'll do my best, and I'll tell you that Julie Thompson is away at conference and will be here Wednesday night if there's anything that she needs to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| But essentially the process begins with our own board policy that dictates who has to make up that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8661)|
| 2:24:28| And so that's the easy part when you look at things like finance and operations, human resources, in terms of building that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8668)|
| 2:24:35| You also have to layer in that each member has to fill out a conflict of interest form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| So when we think about, again, that community and their knowledge and work with potentially the schools that would be potentially coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8681)|
| 2:24:49| we have to make sure that they have no conflict of interest with the applying parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| So that actually took some work in some of those instances because of folks and their knowledge of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| So those are really the two big things is ensuring that, again, we meet our policy and that we feel like we have representation that speaks to the needs of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8699)|
| 2:25:09| the demographics, and we include parent voice and all of that in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate especially the clarification around the conflict of interest policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| I think that's obviously it's important in any of the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| But I think specifically we're dealing with an issue that for some is very controversial to make sure that people are ensured that there's not undue interest in the agreement, the arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8722)|
| 2:25:33| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| All right. 9E. Mr. Watson, did you want to speak to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8739)|
| 2:25:47| Thank you, Madam Chair. No, I think we've had most of our discussion earlier in the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| The only reason I added it to this part of the agenda is because if the board did feel like it wanted to take action at Wednesday, we had an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8753)|
| 2:26:02| All right. Thank you. Item 9F. Ms. Spike, would you like to speak to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8762)|
| 2:26:11| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| We're revisiting this after it being in November, and I just wanted to say that I really think this decision should be between parents and our educators that are working with our children every single day and working so hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8775)|
| 2:26:28| And I really appreciate what Dr. Norton wrote up and sent to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| And I think that if the law had read in some of the ways that she wrote, we wouldn't be here talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| We wouldn't have be so concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| But I am really concerned if things aren't changed. And I know a lot of people have said it's going to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8801)|
| 2:26:48| I'm never a person that likes to depend on what's potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| I like to make sure that I've asked for what I want to have happen and what I feel to have happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8812)|
| 2:26:59| And this isn't just also me speaking just for me personally, because my third grader, I hope, will be OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8819)|
| 2:27:08| But realistically, when you look at the list of other schools, Alcoa, Anderson County, Williamson, Wheatley County, Lynchburg, Robertson County, Wilson County, Warren County, Sullivan County, and Blount County, as well as potentially Athens City, Davidson County as potentials that haven't passed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8828)|
| 2:27:27| I don't know if Hamblin County has written theirs up yet, but they have passed that they will be writing theirs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8847)|
| 2:27:34| So there is this whole list of schools that say that this needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| But I do think that this law gives us a really good opportunity to identify the kids that need help and for us to ask for money, for funding, and to get those ideas to put that into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8859)|
| 2:27:52| And to just ping in on the stuff, our conversation last time, some of the things that I included and some of the things I cited were from the National Association of School Psychologists, guidance for retention and things like that, showing what a devastating effect retention can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8872)|
| 2:28:12| I think that giving these kids extra opportunities, but many times dyslexia and things like that are not identified until fourth and fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8892)|
| 2:28:24| And we all know that there are gaps for students, and I don't want to just create that gap wide open for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8904)|
| 2:28:33| And then there are so many unknown things when you look at the frequently asked questions of what is the appeal process for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8913)|
| 2:28:41| And for me in work, I never present a project or am at a place where the project is ready to implement until all of those boxes are checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8921)|
| 2:28:54| And I would love to see more of these boxes be checked, where we know what's going to happen, where teachers know what's going to happen, where parents know what's going to happen before we start implementing this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8934)|
| 2:29:04| So that's my bit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| While we were at our TSBA conference, Dr. Rysluk and I had an opportunity to sit in on a very interesting discussion with Representative White and Representative Love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8953)|
| 2:29:27| And one of the things that stood out to me in that conversation, well, the first thing that stood out is that the whole conversation was on this third grade retention law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8967)|
| 2:29:37| They really didn't talk about much else at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| Once that came up, everyone in the room wanted to be sure that their points were heard and their points were all the same as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8980)|
| 2:29:49| But the thing that stood out to me was Representative White's comment, and he is the chair of the Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8989)|
| 2:29:57| His comment, when asked, will you be revisiting this law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| He said, when you get a resolution from about every county in the state, you kind of have to revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9004)|
| 2:30:12| And I think that says a lot to us about the necessity of having this piece of paper that says we would like you to revisit this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9012)|
| 2:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9022)|
| 2:30:25| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| I missed that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| I would have loved to have been there in person for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| Ms. Pike, I appreciate your work on this and just have a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| You referenced Dr. Norton's email that she sent, and I know that she didn't write that in the form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| She wrote that to think through specific potential wording changes to make the law better itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| And I know that this is dated 1031.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| Was there anything that changed in the wording for the potential resolution between when you presented it in November and when we have it now, based on Dr. Norton's recommendations or anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9053)|
| 2:31:05| Currently, nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| But I talked with Gary, and trying to figure out exactly how it would be that you – honestly, I would like to see some sort of attachment to having this in our –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9068)|
| 2:31:25| some of her changes in our legislative priorities and kind of an attachment or reference in our resolution saying that this is our resolution and the things we're asking for are in our legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9085)|
| 2:31:39| But I don't really know the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| And I'm also interested in what other board members think and would like to see and how this could be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9102)|
| 2:31:49| I want to be collaborative about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| I actually really like the suggestion of us as a district actually making some recommendations in terms of how the law could actually be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9112)|
| 2:32:01| And that probably can't happen necessarily in the form of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| Mr. Dupler, is there an opportunity or what would be the mechanism to – if we were to pass this resolution or something similar to it and we were to push it on to legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9124)|
| 2:32:13| is there some type of formal mechanism that we would need to say, and by the way, here's our suggested changes potentially to the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9133)|
| 2:32:21| Well, that can be done – thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| That can be done, you know, as part of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| But, you know, there have been a lot of these resolutions, as has been discussed, and TSBA has a similar resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9151)|
| 2:32:38| So it's up to this board as to how you all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| But I think Ms. Byk did suggest one way, which would be have the resolution, keep it in the general form, which is very similar to the other resolutions that have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9162)|
| 2:32:54| and then make it an attachment, you know, send as a second resolution, you know, a letter, you know, something, reaching out to the legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9174)|
| 2:33:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| Dr. Norton, thank you for your work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| I appreciate you and whoever else you involved making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| I do think it's important for us to add our voice on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| I mean, some might say, well, if everybody's already submitting one, one voice doesn't hurt, but we are the third largest district in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9195)|
| 2:33:22| And I think in some ways our – I don't think our voice should matter more, but collectively we represent more students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9202)|
| 2:33:30| And so I think if we didn't submit a similar resolution, it actually might send an – it could send another message, maybe an unintended message of, oh, Knox County doesn't think this is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9210)|
| 2:33:42| They kind of like it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| And so I'm not necessarily as concerned about the particular wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| I think the intent is to say we think you should revisit it, that there's probably some problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| But you all – but also I don't think the wording says, hey, we shouldn't do anything to support our third graders, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9233)|
| 2:33:59| I mean, I think the – I think it recognizes that, no, we need to do some things to help our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9239)|
| 2:34:05| And we just – we need you all to do a little more work to make sure that this is not something that actually ends up having the unintended consequence of harming children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9245)|
| 2:34:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| Dr. Norton, thank you for giving us exactly what I had – what I was asking for, which were specifics around what we – how we would want to see this law improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9258)|
| 2:34:27| So I'm not opposed to just adding this, the points you made, the list one through seven, under – at the end of this resolution so that it's in one document with what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9267)|
| 2:34:43| Because that was the point I made last time, that we need to tell them what we want to see in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9283)|
| 2:34:49| So I wouldn't be opposed to including that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| And then in our legislative priorities, if we want to be more vague there, we could be more vague there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| But I think that adding attachments or documents I think is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| They're not going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| So, you know, I think that if we have here the language, I think you could probably just add it right to the end of this so that they have everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9304)|
| 2:35:14| That would be my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9314)|
| 2:35:20| I would agree with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| I would like to see it all collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| You know, because I think the resolution in itself is good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9324)|
| 2:35:29| But I also think that, you know, if you're going to complain about something, at least offer up some suggestions as to ways you would like to see it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9329)|
| 2:35:44| So I would be supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| Yeah, I think it's, and this is a lot like what some of the other ones that have passed across the state are, but to me it's too vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| We need to give them, this is specifically what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| And so I appreciate Dr. Norton's thoughts around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9357)|
| 2:36:01| And I believe Representative McKenzie might have even said that when he spoke, tell us ways we can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| So that actually is also honoring his request by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9368)|
| 2:36:14| So let's see, who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| Ms. Owen, you are next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| I have some concerns with too much specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| If we are too specific, will our legislators also be too specific, which is what they did to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9386)|
| 2:36:36| And could it happen that they take what we intend to be suggestions and use them as, okay, you don't want to use that test, use this test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9396)|
| 2:36:48| So that would concern me if we are giving them something very, very specific that could also have some unintended consequences of leaving out other possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9408)|
| 2:37:02| So I think the broader language is what we want to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9422)|
| 2:37:07| We want to ask them to revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| We want to ask them to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| But outside of that resolution, we also need to ask them to look at all of the ways that children are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9431)|
| 2:37:20| We want them to look not just at all of the educational implications, but we want them to look at the child's medical needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9440)|
| 2:37:30| We want them to look at the child's psychological needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| We want to consider every individual student's needs instead of saying here's the one thing that's going to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9452)|
| 2:37:42| And I'm not able to show it to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| I'm going to try to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| One of the schools that I have visited recently showed me some data, which I normally don't want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9467)|
| 2:37:53| But the way they are using it is marvelous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9473)|
| 2:37:57| They showed me a student whose scores on TN Ready were the lowest scores I have ever seen on any TN Ready test ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9477)|
| 2:38:06| They were the very bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| His class grades were A's and B's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| If our legislators look at that, their reaction is that somebody is not doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9493)|
| 2:38:21| But the curriculum coach and the principals in this school are looking more deeply than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9501)|
| 2:38:28| and they are looking at other things that have happened through the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| So they have looked at all of his benchmark tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| So you come from these tanked TN Ready scores and these fine classroom grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9515)|
| 2:38:42| and then you see his benchmark tests all through the year, mastery, mastery, mastery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9522)|
| 2:38:50| excelling, all of these terrific scores to show that he does know what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9530)|
| 2:38:58| But if we had to depend on that one test, he would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9538)|
| 2:39:03| We don't know what happened on that one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| We don't know why that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| That's something else to be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221205?start=9549)|
