| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=0)|
| 0:00:31| Good morning, everybody. For those of you listening, I'm Amy Brooks, I'm the interim executive director for Knoxville Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=31)|
| 0:00:40| And this is our January agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| And as the commissioners have already seen I shared out this morning that's really great new tool we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| At least one of you have taken a look at it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| So, as so we've developed, we've actually developed a couple of new tools and we have one of the one of the works which I'll share it at maybe the next agenda review meeting but I'm so this new data resource I sent you an email if I haven't had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:01:08| to look at it yet but there's a link in your email it's on our website. And it's called panorama, it was created by planning staff to replace our background reports that are found in our sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=68)|
| 0:01:20| So those of you who are familiar with those those are found in each one of our 12 sector plans, it's a report, it's found in the beginning, and it includes information such as environmental resources demographics landings population transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:32| facilities and utilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| And so as you can imagine that data becomes outdated pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| So one thing that we wanted to talk about for a couple years is to keep this information more up to date. And so staff create an online tool that allows users to look at this, these, these data, and these maps and interactive way, and provides a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=104)|
| 0:02:01| greater detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| So it includes dashboard dashboards on population demographics economic conditions, quality of life, housing and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=123)|
| 0:02:12| And as new data becomes available will continue to add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| And the data comes from a variety of sources to the US Census Bureau and these are the same sources that were used when we were updating when we used it for our sector plan so the CDC EPA was in full, which is what we use for our demographic projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=137)|
| 0:02:33| Or one of one of the resources, and it allows anybody using this to view the data for the entire county or you can select by sector, and then it provides additional information about people in economy all throughout the all throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=153)|
| 0:02:48| So really excited about this we hope you take a look at it. I appreciate any input you have any questions you have. And I think in an upcoming agenda review meeting I'll have one of our information services staff present this tool to you so you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:03:01| to ask some more questions, but I wanted to get it out to you before then so you had a chance to hopefully take a look at it and and tell us what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=181)|
| 0:03:11| Additionally, we have, I did not send this in the email but I will I will share this out after after this meeting we have something called the Greenway spotlight it's a story map that Chelsea who you all probably haven't met but she's one of our AmeriCorps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:24| members, and she's been working on this for a while and it's, it's a really fun tool, it's a way to help people familiarize themselves with a different greenways and throughout Knoxville Knox County, and she does provide individual spotlights on a different greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:39| every Tuesday and Thursday and this is what we call story map so I'll send that out to you and encourage you all to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| It's a really fun resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| Any updates I have for today and I thought we'd just go ahead and get into the agenda unless there's questions by the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| We'll start off with rezoning is in plan amendment so 11 g 20 RZ, and there's also accompanied by a plan of sector plan amendment as well as a one year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| This is Ronnie Welch and Michelle Portia will take you through this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=250)|
| 0:04:18| Thank you, Amy. We actually just about five minutes ago got an email from Ben Bowen's requesting postponement of this item. So I don't know if you also want me to cover it or just skip into the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:37| Okay, well we'll move on to item number 10, which is 11 j 20 RZ this is acre Kingston Pike staff is recommending general request and Michelle will walk you through the staff's analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:51| Yes. So, this one is at the corner of Kingston Pike and Winston road it's kind of across from Barnes and Noble toys are us just to familiarize with you with where you are surrounded by commercial uses and a few office uses but then it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:05:06| adjacent to this mixed use special district, the downtown West area to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| I'm looking at the zoning it was recently changed. It was c four which was highway commercial and with some c three kind of scattered in prior to the adoption of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:24| After the zoning ordinance south of I 40 which passes right through here. We retained the highway commercial designation on the northern end of Kingston Pike but changed it on transitioning down to CG three, and then transitioning down again into that residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:38| area. Again, keeping in mind that there's that mixed use special district coming through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| So looking at the zoning considerations. Typically we have people that are requesting different base zones in the with separate uses attached to each zone, and the old zoning ordinance it was the same thing we were always predominantly considering uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=346)|
| 0:06:00| So this is the first case we've actually had where someone is requesting basically the same day so that CG zoning just different level within that that CG zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:10| And then the rest becomes not at all about the uses anymore, but about the dimensional standards and the design standards, since those are the differences between the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| And so I don't want to delve too deeply into this but just really quick looking at the difference between CG one and CG three. There's not a whole lot of difference there's a little bit in the maximum building heights CG one caps at 45 CG three after 45 there's a setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=380)|
| 0:06:36| once it gets taller so the experience from the street is still that 45 feet at that bill to zone wherever the building is but you kind of builds backwards a little bit from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=396)|
| 0:06:48| The main differences are in the front setbacks. So the minimum front setback is a bill to zone of zero to 20 feet, and then the minimum courts corner side setback of zero to 15, which basically the corner side setback is kind of a fancy way of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:07:03| that you're not going to be able to get to the other frontage on your side street so along Kingston Pike here it's that 20 foot bill to zone and then along Winston it's zero to 15 through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| The applicant has submitted a letter saying that because of the bill to zone and the closer setback that that would warrant building a larger building and I disagree with that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=431)|
| 0:07:21| I'm looking at having those buildings closer to the street where it's required along here, there's no requirement that has to be that a building has to be with any within certain amount of space in either the interior side setback or the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:34| So, the building doesn't have to stretch to meet those boundaries that can be whatever size it needs to be to accommodate their use and their parking up along this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:45| So I think to say that CG three is the highest density based on the bill to setbacks I think it's a little bit of a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=465)|
| 0:07:53| So just to kind of reiterate why we are thinking that a recommending denominator is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:08:02| You guys might remember a case that came before you just a few months ago on Asheville Highway, it was a hotel. It was some to CG one and it passed the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| When it got to city council there was a good bit of debate over why we had recommended approval of CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| And, you know, they did vote to approve it but there were a good number of them that voted yes, but said they would like to have seen this and they were going to minimum that voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:30| Based on what we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| So, I interpret that as, you know, being tasked with really looking critically at where we choose to apply CG two and CG three, because of those elements versus the CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:43| And then finally, do we really want to go with CG two and CG three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| So, you know, as development occurs over the next, I don't know, 1020 years buildings come and go, they're going to be closer to the street, they're going to have more design elements and they're going to be closer to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=528)|
| 0:08:56| And so, you know, I think it's really important to look at where we choose to apply CG two and CG three, because of those elements versus the CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=536)|
| 0:09:05| And then finally, do we really want to set a precedent for accepting a lesser level of zoning, when it's surrounded by this CG three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=545)|
| 0:09:14| And so, you know, as development occurs over the next, I don't know, 1020 years buildings come and go, they're going to be closer to the street, they're going to have more design elements attached to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| And then having this one here and CG one, someone could literally just build a square box and call it a day and it would be in compliance with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| So looking at those design standards, you can see their standards for CG two and CG three but none for CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| And so they include things like no blank wall areas beyond 30 feet, having a change in textures or depths and projection like reveals or posters, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=574)|
| 0:09:45| So kind of creating some visual interest in a building versus having that square metal box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| So we look at this in denial as kind of protecting those design elements and dimensional standards, because it's so close to that are in one, but also because of that mixed use special district that comes through here, which calls for more urban design buildings closer to the street, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=591)|
| 0:10:07| So we feel like the CG three is more aligned with that mixed use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| Then the CG one said would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| I think I've covered everything with that I'll open it up to see if anyone has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Is there a request, is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| You might miss this but is the CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| No, see for it was this the highway commercial zone prior to the new zone ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| So we've cut that CH two off on the northern end of Kingston Pike and transition down to CG three here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| It was, but what I'm saying is, it was C four before correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| And what they're asking it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Is this is the CG one equivalent to that C four that was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| No, see for and see age or the equivalent zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| So, if the CH were to continue down here to bring me your boulevard that would have been what it was before we go back up to the comparable signing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=671)|
| 0:11:21| I don't know if I'm answering the crux of what you're trying to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| What I'm saying is, basically, are they asking to have it put back to where it was, or are they asking for something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| No, they're asking for something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| They had originally asked for the comparable zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| And, you know, I said, it might be an easier sell to go to CG one saying, you know, versus CH, but, again, not guaranteeing that we would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=696)|
| 0:11:45| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=722)|
| 0:12:14| Add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| The CG1 is obviously a lesser impact than the CH, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| The CG zones 1, 2, and 3 all have the same uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| all of which are lesser impact than CH. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| So, Michelle, is this just really about a setback issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| that they want the building set back? Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| It is about the setback. And for them, it's about the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| For us, it's about the setback and the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| It's not about the uses at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| because the uses within the CG1, 2, and 3 zones are all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| And two, this is a really small site. It's approximately a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| They're actually looking to get two separate uses on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| both of which are fairly vehicular oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| One of them is a drive-through. The other one is an oil change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| And so there's two separate uses on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| requiring a lot of different vehicular traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| traversing around the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| maneuvering separate drive lanes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| And so I think that that's where they're running into trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| with needing to maximize the site is because I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| they're kind of trying to get too much into this one particular site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| more than what it could probably handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| I think this is a case of, you know, whether we want to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| our new zoning ordinance or allow people to routinely come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| and try to, you know, go back to the old style of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| I understand where you're coming from, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| And I mean, these are the decisions that we have to make as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| And, you know, I think CG3 is appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| And you bring up a really valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| There's actually another rezoning from a higher CG to a CG1 next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| And so this one is the first of its kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| kind of sets a precedent for what decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| this board might make going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Hey, just excuse me, just so I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| this is kind of confusing, but the CG1 and the CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| I guess, are the same uses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Okay, so the difference is you want to force them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| to put the building up close to the road under the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| and they may know, maybe don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Is that what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| It's not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| I guess it's just us supporting the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| and the comments that were made by the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| at the Asheville Highway rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| and looking at the design elements and the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| and making those consistent in an area versus downgrading to a CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Again, someone could throw up a square model box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| and call it a day and be in compliance with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| versus having requirements for things like transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| connection to the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| some sort of textual change to create a visual interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| in the building, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| And then the setbacks, because that's the physical form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| that you see and experience from the street as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| So just having that consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| So these all developed around it closer to the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| and this guy was set back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| just would feel a little bit discordant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| Maybe not now, but 10, 20 years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| once that area has developed, then it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| So it's just kind of protecting that design intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| The recode process was pretty extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| and none of the zones were changed lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| It was all done with a public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| a lot of input from city council, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And so we feel like supporting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Okay, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| It's not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| I don't understand the compelling reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| I mean, these guys, it appears their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| has been a little bit down zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| but I know that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| I've passed by it every day on the way to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| It's got quite a bit of unused land with that small parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| but it's unclear to me what we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| I mean, I can't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| I'm gonna have to look into this a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| before I understand what we're fighting for, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| I think it's just getting used to looking at zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| as more than just the uses that are attached to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| It's kind of looking at the zone as the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| and the dimensional standards and the zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| because that all was something that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| that's new with the new zoning arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| We didn't have the separate levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| with those different competing things within the same zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| And so I think that's just a different way of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| Michelle, that to me is a very compelling part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| of your argument when you explained that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| we're really looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| for the 10, 20 years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| and how that decision would change that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| as opposed to everything around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| And when I think about that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| because I'm very familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| we go to Trader Joe's all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| that is not an area that I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| has the qualities that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| like that more human scale versus car scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| I'm going to put it in those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| But what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| that CG3 starts to bring in those design elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| that do make things more human scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| which as you think about how that area grows and changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| that would be really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| Any other questions or comments on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| I would just say to Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| since he's wrestling with it a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| that we did go through a very arduous, long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| to really reshape the look of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| with our zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| And I think it's probably our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| to support that at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| since it was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| And we're not limiting the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| We're really trying, this is more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| this is probably more about aesthetics than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| And we're trying to make this more pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| And boy, this stretch is certainly challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| Yeah, it is not pedestrian friendly right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| I've tried crossing that street, getting my car washed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| I have too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| It's a dangerous proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| But this is the first step, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| then we can do some traffic calming, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| And work with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| So, you know, it's incremental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| So let me ask this question, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| I mean, I'm just sitting here listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| But I mean, we go down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| I guess, how do we ensure, if we start down this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| that this is how we're going to hold this one applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| to all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| That those are the exact same things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| that we hold everyone else to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| so that we get five years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| And we've made little minor adjustments all along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| But now we're, you know, 20 miles farther apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| than where we start today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| But we've been, you know, this applicant was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Whereas five years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| we might be doing something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| How do we just keep that consistency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| If this is what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| so that we're not treating this applicant differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| than, say, another applicant a couple of years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| That's where I just, I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| how we keep that consistency from this standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Just so that we're treating everyone fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| for all time going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| That's where I'm just struggling with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I guess, with some of what Scott's mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| You know, just, I don't understand the CG 1, 2, 3 enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| and all the design elements and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| to really know how we keep that consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| So I'm more just looking for help in how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| I think by supporting the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Yeah, Commissioner Hill, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I just simply said, supporting the new code would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| And I'll just weigh in here that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| relying on the professional staff to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| when we provide a recommendation to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| challenge us to be consistent in our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| And, you know, we do look at past approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| and try to provide that analysis to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| But going forward, just keep challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| the professional staff to continue to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| And one thing I'll say as well is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| it is a new code and we've been virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| for many months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| And I feel like we haven't had enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| spent with you all as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| to maybe do a deeper dive into the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| So if that's something that you all are interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| I mean, we can spend a little bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| over the next six to eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| breaking it down and maybe delving a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| in particular to these commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| with the different levels of intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| and dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| I mean, I just want to go back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| And I've said this in the past about the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| I think we did a reasonable job of researching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| I think our staff did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| But the problem I have with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| the problem I had with it at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| is you have people that have pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| that were zoned a certain way and had been for ages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| and we changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| And when in doing so, we changed the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| available uses of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| And I'd say most of the time without their knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| I know it was in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| I know there was a lot of community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| but you got people out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| it happened right down the street from our plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| where a guy had a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| and he's been using it for a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| And all of a sudden he was told he couldn't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| He had to come up and apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| I'm sure you're familiar with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| So that's the only thing I want to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| while we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| I think everything it says is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| We do need to support our zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| but we also need to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| that we have changed the use of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| You say we didn't change the use of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| but we really do if one restricts it to certain standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| that's restricting the use of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| And it was a very good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| And it wasn't that way before recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| So we just have to keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| I want to keep those things in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| as well as the person's property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| in addition to all the other things we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| I would like to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| and comment on Commissioner Eddie Smith's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| about how we maintain consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| It seems like this is the most important step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| since this is the first instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| that we've had of this type of request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| that this is the very most important decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| that we make to maintain that consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| So I think it is important that we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| that keeping the CG3 as recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| And I just want to see, just to reconfirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| this is kind of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| that Commissioner Roth's comment is understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| For the case that we're discussing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| we are not changing the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| like there's not a use restriction difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| They can still use the property the way that they intend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| It's that there are some aesthetic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| that have to be addressed differently, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| No, what I'm saying is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| No, between the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| What I'm saying is, through RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| we changed this property from C4 Highway Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| to CG whatever it is, 3 or whatever it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| We changed that use of that property through RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| And what they're asking now is to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| to something a little less restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| more restrictive than what it was before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| but less restrictive than what RECODE changed it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| is what I'm seeing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| And that's where I say we've got to be real careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| because it happened a lot with RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| It happened, people's property got rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| And I would say down-zoned, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| in some cases, against their will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| or against their knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| And then all of a sudden they wake up one day and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| wait a minute, this piece of property I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| I can no longer do what I want to do on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| because the zoning's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| I'd kind of like to weigh in on that question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| So a couple of different points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| So the C4 that's to the north went to CH2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| which does still have design standards associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| So even if they were asking for a comparable zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| consistent with what's in the area to CH2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| that would still have design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Regarding the uses, the CH uses that are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| and the CG uses that are allowed are pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| CG is a little bit more restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| in terms of the uses with regards to like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| used car sales lots and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| There's less behavior, more of the intense side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| of the commercial uses that are allowed in CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| But other than that, the uses between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| are pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:20| Well, again, what I'm trying to get at though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| is I'm trying to get back to what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| Sure, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I just wanted to clarify for this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| C4 was definitely allowed a whole lot more stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| than what either one of the CG1, 2, or 3 did, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| The old C4 allowed a lot more uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| or a lot more different things than 1, 2, or 3, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| Than the CH1, 2, or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I'd have to look at that more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| My understanding is that they're very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Somebody who might've been here during that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| can maybe recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Yeah, I think they are very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| and it's very nuanced in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| we changed a lot of, the code was really dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And so some of the uses, I mean, we added uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| So in some cases, people's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| there might've been some uses that fell off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| that were no longer permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| but there were uses that were added that were permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| For instance, in these corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| there's a lot of, there's mixed use allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| So there's housing that wasn't allowed previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| So it's a little more nuanced than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| And I think that's maybe one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| it might be beneficial for us to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| maybe a more in-depth discussion about the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Potentially, if you all are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Yeah, and I'm not saying I'm against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| I'm not saying I'm not taking a position today, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| but I just think we need to look at the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| that before recode and what they're asking for now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| and let's see how those differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Commissioner Hill and Smith have had their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Scott Smith have had their hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Yes, I would say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| you know, if we want to continue down a path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| and if we're proud of Clinton Highway and Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| then we probably ought to repeal the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| You know, we were intentional in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| you know, hiring this third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| and reviewing our old 50 plus year code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| because we wanted to improve our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| And I think that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| And for someone to not have known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| that they were not getting rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| you know, they almost have to have been living in a cave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| because this thing went on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| I think we had over 100 meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| It was in all the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| And also, because we're not changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| we're not affecting their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Let's not forget, when they redevelop this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| TDOT has a say in this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| And TDOT will change how this property is accessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| So it's not that they get a free pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| because of what they rezoned in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| When they tear down this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| their accesses will change because TDOT has new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| And, you know, TDOT's not going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| well, we passed this new access standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| We're going to give you the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| That's not the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| And so I think this is all in an effort to improve our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| And I think it warrants a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| because a lot of our commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| they weren't involved in the process of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| So I appreciate all of you guys inquiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| and trying to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| And there is a lot to understand about this new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| No, I'm sorry, Scott, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I hate to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| No, I'll let you keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| I just want to get a couple of things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| But I'm real interested to hear what the applicant's issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| But my questions are these as I'm looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Does this new zoning require the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| to be built up on the front of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| And could it require someone to build a larger building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| rather than a smaller building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| And I don't, I think our goals are all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| I just, I remember on the Sutherland Avenue thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| we rezoned for that Mexican restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| and those guys were required to have their parking in the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| and they fought it like crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| because they had had a bad experience with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| I just want to understand, is that part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| We're going to make somebody put the building up on the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| maybe park in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| And could it require people to build larger buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| than they want to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| So the answer to whether or not it would require them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| to put the buildings closer, yes, that is the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| is to have to make the buildings closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Regarding whether it would build a bigger building, no, it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| And that's because the, just looking at the screen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| you've got the zero to 20 feet zone along Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| and the zero to 15 along Winston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| There's nothing saying that they have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| within a certain, you can, there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| you can't go further than a certain thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| but you don't have to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| there's no build to zone on this side or in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So there's nothing saying that the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| has to stretch to cover, to fill this end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| or to stretch to cover to fill that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| So you could have the same size building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| just floating up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| And again, we're trying to make parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| in the back of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| instead of in front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Is that the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| And I don't think it makes the building any larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| just by putting it closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| All right, I'll be anxious to hear what the applicant says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1841)|
| 0:30:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Mr. Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Yes, I wanted to follow up on an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| that was given earlier in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| The example was that a person could have a use on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| and then the zone is changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| and then they no longer can have the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| It's my understanding that if that use was legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| then the change in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| would allow the original use to continue as non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| It's my understanding that the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| that that use would have to then apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| is if it was illegal to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Well, wait a minute now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I'm wrong, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:26| But if you redevelop the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| the non-conforming building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| that the use, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| The building is non-conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| It must comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| If it was legal prior to the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| the use or the building, it can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| If you're going to expand or change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| then that's when the new rules come into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| And I'm sorry, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Amy, do you recall that one of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| had to request a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| because the city put a stop work order on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| or a stop use order on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| because they were parking trailers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| And he had to reapply for a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| to get back to where he was before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| because it took away a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:14| to make an income on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| So that's not necessarily true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| If you're using the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| all these years, that's definitely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Those two partials were separately zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| weren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| It was on 6th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| 6th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| And he got a letter from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| that said you can no longer park trailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| on this parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| And he'd been doing it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| It was zoned industrial before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| and they rezoned it to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| in the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| And he had to go through the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| to get back to where he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| so he could keep his income on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| And that's the kind of examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| And Tim, I hate to disagree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| but people don't read the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| and do all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| This guy had no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| his property had been rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| until he got a letter from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| saying you can no longer use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| for what you're using it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| And that's the kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| I think we ought to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| I'm not saying I disagree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| although I did vote against recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| for these very reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| because I don't think we gave people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| enough opportunity to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| But that was the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| But what I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| we've got to keep these things in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| I just don't think it's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| if they rezoned Z4 before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| and they got downzoned to one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| We just need to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| these decisions we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| also impact the property owner as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| not just the surrounding neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I just want to keep all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| in the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| when we're making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| I disagree with this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I'm just saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| you need to be thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| mindful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| OK, I'm done talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Sorry, I'll mute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| OK, any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Commissioner Korbelik,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| did you have another question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:12| or comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| I would be curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| if the staff could follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| on the example given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| stating that the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| had to go back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| because it seems to be an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| in some of the philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| that the commissioners have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| And I was always pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| that if the use was existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| then it would be nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| But if the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| wanted to change the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| if it's a nonconforming building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| or the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| then the new code applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And so it required the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| initiating an action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| for the new code to take effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| The example that was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| seems contrary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| And I'm hoping the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| can at least let me know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| the details of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Sure, we can follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| on the 6th Avenue case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| I just want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2110)|
| 0:35:10| in Article 17.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| nonconforming building structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| and uses of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| It does address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| So nonconforming building structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| use of land lawfully existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| at the time of the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| or amendment of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| may be continued to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| as provided in this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| And then there's a series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| But I'll send that link to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| And also we'll follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| about the 6th Avenue case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| that Commissioner Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| One more piece of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| on this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| He had to apply for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| which we didn't charge him for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| because it's in the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| that we would not charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| if they're asking for the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| But it went to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| It was approved on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| and Charles, I can't remember which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| I think it was Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2153)|
| 0:35:53| that took it off on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| He took it off because he wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| to go back and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| the property some more himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| So it didn't even make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| through the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| of City Council the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| And this was a case clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| that he was using the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| the same way he'd been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| the property for the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| So it didn't really work that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| with this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| Amy, I just wanted to chime in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| and say that you were mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| some future presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| on understanding code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| and presenting that to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| And I would love that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| just because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| that we're all still getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| acquainted with this new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| So if there's a topic or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| or a previous code to a new code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| that you guys want to just present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| just to kind of introduce it slowly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| I'm totally in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| So yes, we'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Okay, I don't see more hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| So we're going to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| to item number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| This is 1E21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Randy Genard, you all received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| quite a few comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| This is the third time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| this request has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| And Michelle will review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Okay, so just to orient you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| with the site a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| this is Nashville Center Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| is right around down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| This is that Target Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| coming up along Greenway Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| it's predominantly single family houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| on Beverly Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| and off the side streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| with the exception of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| industrial property to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| And then just kind of looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| different lot sizes on Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| and then across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| This is the property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| So looking west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| So the sector plan currently has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| these properties designated as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| And that is the result of a 2018 case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| that went before council and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| And the zoning is not in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| So the back of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| is zoned general residential in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| And then the middle part is industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| and then plug way through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| So I don't really necessarily feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| like this is the best fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| to continue the industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| even closer into the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| So approving the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| would bring in sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| would make the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| compliant with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| There are some challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| on the site though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| with all of that said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| So there's a good portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2319)|
| 0:38:39| that is in FEMA floodplains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| and flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| So you can see the 100 year floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:46| and then the hatch mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| is the actual floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| And then there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:50| some significant slope on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| to the northern part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| And then it kind of tapers off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| into this greener flatter area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| which that's the zero to 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| So the slope analysis recommended 2.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| I'm sorry, 2.47| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And this is on the 61.54 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| that are not located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| within the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| And it's kind of caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| a little bit confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| in how we look at the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| So the applicant has 196 dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| that he's proposing over the 61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| However, historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| we have not ever removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| floodplain property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| from the calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| when we're looking at the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| So 196 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| over the entire 78 parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| equals a density of 2.51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| And so that's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| for our recommendation of 2.51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| over the 3.22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| that the applicant's requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| is just reflecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| that different acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| in the calculation used for the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| And looking at removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| the floodplain area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| from the calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| again, we haven't typically done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| So that would almost be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| penalizing this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| for having so much floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| on the property and handling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Differently than we have in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| which is trying to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| We do have some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| that go along with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| So that's braiding of the steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| to be kept out of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| And development should not recur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| in floodplains or the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| There is in the last concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| there were some walking trails along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| And so Knox County Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| has requested to retain a trail easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| along the southern border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| to encompass those proposed walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| And then clustering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| the housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| on the flatter portion of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| that's 0 to 15 that I pointed out earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| to reduce the amount of land disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| to protect retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| infiltration capabilities of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| mitigate erosion on steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| And then just a reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| of the 2019 approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| that came through about a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| it was December of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| And due to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| I guess discrepancy between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| you know, whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:02| to include the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| 61 acres or 71 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| instead of approving it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| at a certain density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| is approved as a number of dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| just to be, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| to clarify that moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| how many dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| the applicant will be able to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| So that approval came through at 210 dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| And this was over the 203| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| that had been allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| by staff's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| None approval was based largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| So it was small dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| that were clustered together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| walking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| permeable pavers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| land donation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| I don't want to go too deep into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| because we did not include that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| with this year's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| And that's just basically, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| we're trying to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| with how we look at rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| and not really applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| one specific use to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| but any of the uses that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| And so if you approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| this concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:41:54| we could still come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| with something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| So it's just looking at, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| the density and the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| And so there are some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| you've seen some letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:04| coming in from different residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:08| and they're mostly concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| with the traffic in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| the flooding in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| and just general road conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| And so obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| with this number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| a traffic study would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| And so that's going to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| at the site distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| the access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| It's going to look at road conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| There's a bridge over the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| All that stuff would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| as part of that traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And so that wouldn't really be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| to the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| but more at a later stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| And then the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:35| with the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| And there were several photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| that were submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| and they were from the flood event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| a major flood event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| that occurred in February of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| And so it's really hard to get a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| of how that land actually floods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| just based on those photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| if you can recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| half the county was flooded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| And so it's not really indicative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| of normal flood events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| I'm not really sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| how much the land floods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| although I do understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| that there is some flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| that does occur in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| But according to the stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| as long as their calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| can prove that they're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| to make that flooding any worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| that they're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| stormwater detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| things to mitigate the developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| that they are at pre-development levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| of water runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| then that's the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| And my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| if they can't meet that calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| that they would have to either reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:24| or permeable surfaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| until they could reach that calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| And so all that's going to be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| of the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| again, really wouldn't be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:32| but just bringing it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| because you've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| so many comments about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| through email and through our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| And with that, I'll open it up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Commissioner Grass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| All right. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| And I'll start off by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| I'm having a terrible time hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| and it's on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| My ears are clogged up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| That's why I have my video turned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I don't want you just looking in my ear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| because I have to get so close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| to the darn computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| But anyway, I'm wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| why we're not considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| the hillside protection plan in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| It seems to me that this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| where it would really apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| on a bad piece of property like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| that has a lot of constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Why aren't we using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| the hillside protection numbers off of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| That would be 152 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| I'm not saying I'm in favor or against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| but when we have a plan like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| why aren't we using it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| And in the written material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| it's nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| It looks to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| it hasn't even been considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| other than the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| there's one sheet that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| what the result would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| So if it was unclear in my staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| then I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| But that kind of goes back again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| to looking at the overall number of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| versus the number of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| that are included in the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| So this calculation is 2.47 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| over 61.54 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| And so that 61.54 acres is largely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| mostly to make it simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| it's just the white part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Historically, we've never removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| the floodplain area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| So if you have a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| that recommends three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| and it had a little bit of floodplain on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| we've always just had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| that three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| over the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Just not necessarily as a matter of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| but that's just how we've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| And to be consistent with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| and not penalize one applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| we felt like it was best to continue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| and to not include it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| because it's not been done historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| by our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| And so looking at that 2.47,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| his 196 dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| when you take it over the entire 78 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| is 2.51 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| which are very, very similar to the 2.47| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| that would normally be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| to the entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| And so again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| that comes with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| for him to build clustered in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| disturbing very little land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| and these other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| in order to protect the natural filtration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and the ability of the soil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| to retain any water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| before it goes down into the lower areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| I hope I'm explaining that okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| I may have missed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| but why is this coming back to us again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Is it because I have a changed concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| or did it not pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| No, so he withdrew it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| before the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| took action on it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| And so he's coming back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| I guess to kind of keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| within his vesting rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| We haven't seen a concept plan for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Just in talking to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| I understand it's very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| to what we saw in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| We had made several recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| and he's verbally told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| that he's taken all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| and has done those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| And that's the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| The result of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| is the decreased number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| of dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| but I haven't actually seen the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Two buckets of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| First bucket on slide 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| Michelle, the staff recommendation slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:41| These are recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| This is what we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| the staff is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| we would like you to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| You said he's verbally said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| he is or is looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| but there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| that requires him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:47:57| So we did not condition the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| So it gets really tricky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| in conditioning rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| even in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| even though it's not part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| of their ordinance not to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| We reached out to their law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| and I don't want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| that it's ground on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| You can apply conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| when it's not regarding the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| but we just felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2896)|
| 0:48:16| to be on the safe side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| to make them as recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| and not conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| But these are already incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| into the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| that he had submitted with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And I will say too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| because it's planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| you guys will see the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| if it does, if the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| does get approved by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| The concept plan itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| will come before this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Thank you for that footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| The second question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| is about the legacy parks aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| because it does still play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| into it because it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| it's been part of the history of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Does anyone know if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| is real at this point or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Yeah, so legacy parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| submitted a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| you know, with the 2019 proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| of rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| and they are considering the donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| And I think that everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| kind of came to a halt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| after it was pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| I don't think any further work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| was done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| So the fact that they haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| actually accepted the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| I don't think is indicative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| that they're not intending to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| I just don't think they've looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:23| since December of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| So it could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| but it could also not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| I hope that they'll speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| with the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| The applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Yeah, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| He asked for instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| on how to walk today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| So I'm sure he'll hear you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| and comment appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Here's my frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| On the one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| when we have the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| to rezone to PR with the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| the argument has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| or at least the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| among commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| has been that we should allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| a high density to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| creative use and design of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| and that we can then decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| when the PR actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| concept plan comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| we can decide if it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| So that's one argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| But then when the PR concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| comes to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| there's the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| has spent all this time and money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| coming up with this particular layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| and we shouldn't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| We should honor the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| that has been put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Those are conflicting points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| And I would like us at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| to discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| maybe not now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| but I find it personally frustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| to hear both of these points of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| as we go through this rezone PR process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| I just wanted to get it off my chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| Commissioner Eason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| did you have another comment or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Anybody else on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| The Knoxville Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| trail easement request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Could you explain a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| How does that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| you know, in conjunction with this happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Yeah, so when the 2019 request came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| there was a set of walking trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| through this area here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| and the applicant was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| that the Parks and Rec service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| could connect to a set of park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| a different park on a day or drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| When I reached out to the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Park and Recreation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| or department, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| this time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| they said they didn't have any plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| to connect it to a day or drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| but would still like to keep the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| to encourage the walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| So I don't think that they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| public walking trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| you know, since there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| outer connection anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| but there would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| walking trails available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| to the people within this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| Or I guess if other neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| could walk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| they would probably could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Okay, so the easement already exists then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| No, no, the easement would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| as part of the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| it would be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| and shown on the plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| when it comes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Okay, so then if it is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| even though there's an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| there's not necessarily a guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| that Parks and Rec will build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| walking trails, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Well, the walking trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| were going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:34| my understanding anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| and the applicant can confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| this at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| my understanding was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3158)|
| 0:52:38| they were going to be the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| to install the walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Yeah, I think the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| was just to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| you know, for it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| able to be public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| and then connect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Okay, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| I don't see any more hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3178)|

| 0:53:45| that you've started screen sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| but it's not showing anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3226)|

| 0:54:00| try something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3240)|
| 0:54:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3280)|
| 0:54:54| Sorry, can you see my screen now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| It's still black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3299)|

| 0:55:05| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| So this is a rezoning plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| and one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| It's off of Merchant Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| between Pleasant Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| and Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| The applicant is requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| that 39.3 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| that you see highlighted here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| go from see-in zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| along the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| and agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| and hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| on the rear portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| to RN-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| So let me flip forward here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| All right, this is an aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| You can see that the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| lies over the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| over the middle section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| of the screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| These are the steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| that are predominantly in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| I'm trying to turn my annotate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3376)|
| 0:56:25| Okay, now, can you see my mouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| So this is the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| They're obviously very similar for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| It shows up as low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3403)|
| 0:56:55| This is the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Again, you can see the see-in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| This is neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| along the frontage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| The applicant wants the entire parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| to go to RN-5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| It is adjacent to some RN-5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| However, we ran a slope analysis on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| It is pretty steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| especially on the rear portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| and it gave us a disturbance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| of 24.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| So regardless of what the decision is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| on the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| if and when this site is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| we would ask for a disturbance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| in line with that 24.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| They could go above that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| if they chose to do a level two review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I wanted to let you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| that this section of Merchant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| is serviced by transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| You can see the Cat Bus 90 route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| going through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| You can also see the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| are along Merchant in this area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| It's also in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| two parent responsibility zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| for Norwood Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| and Northwest Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| And just as a reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| of what those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| for elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| that is a walking distance of one mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| and for middle to high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| that's a walking distance of 1.5 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| And that's not as the crow flies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| that's via the public road network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| This is the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| between what the applicant is requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| and what staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| medium density residential at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| primarily because of the slopes on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| And that would limit our recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| to RN three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| For this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| the applicant is requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3546)|
| 0:59:06| one-year plan amendment to MDRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| which allows consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| of the RN five at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3550)|
| 0:59:24| This is the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| between the two zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| They are pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| The RN three, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| limits your uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| for residential to townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| and single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| and two family or duplexes for RN three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| RN five allows consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| or actually allows by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| multifamily townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| single family and two family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| So what we're recommending is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| here's, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| a breakdown of what the two zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| regulations look like for RN three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| You can see for townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| they're limited to 12,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| for every three dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| An additional 3,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| for each additional dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| And in RN five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| it starts at 2,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| per dwelling unit for townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| So these are some examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| of what areas that are currently zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| RN five and RN three look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| This top one here is off of Cherokee trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| You can see RN three there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| And this lower one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| the Lonsdale homes neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| And also just to remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| that regardless of the RN three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| or RN five designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| we do have other required standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| for development types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| So we have lighting standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| landscape design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| and required buffer yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| And you can see those called out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| and how they're applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| within the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| But primarily they mostly kick in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| at mixed use multifamily and townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| There are also required standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| for multifamily and townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| that aren't required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| for single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| So those relate primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| to the facade articulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| materials, transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| and building separations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| And for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| staff is recommending RN three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| and medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:09| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| I'm sure there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Yes, what I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| is that given it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| close to two thirds of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| is in the hillside steep slope category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| with the RN five allow multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| so that the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| can be clustered away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Is that something the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| has indicated interest in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| The applicant has not said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| what their preferred development type is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| And again, we just look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| all of the uses that are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| within that zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| if they needed to disturb more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| than what is recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| by the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| when they come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| for a development plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| then they could potentially come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| if they needed to clear more area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| than what's recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| by the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| as a level two review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| So they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| depending on how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| they need to clear and grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| for their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| regardless of RN three or RN five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| have to come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| Actually, Liz answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| my question a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| So that was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| One question I did have was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| the sidewalks on Merchant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| are across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| So with it being in the parental zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| would there be a requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| not with this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| with this project progressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| for a crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| to have to be installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| because there's not sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| on that side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| to get down to a crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| that's already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| That would be a great question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| for city engineering on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Unless anyone on our call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| I can just give a quick feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| The city requires sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| on frontage design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| property development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| unless that property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| gets a waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| from that sidewalk requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| So in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| the default is they'll install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| sidewalks on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| And then there's a Wilkerson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| which is across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| that could potentially be a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| for a crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| since that does their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| I guess, western,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| southwestern property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| or northwestern property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| lines up with that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| So that might be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| And then could you go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| a slide or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| just to that 24.9 disturbance area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| Yeah. So when you say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| and this is just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| a general question I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| is that 24.9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| of the total 39.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Or is that only within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| the higher slope area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| It's primarily within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| So they're pretty much fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| for the area that's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| And then they only have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| till 24.9 acres of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| to disturb before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| they have to go to a level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Wait, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| Actually, let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| That is taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| So the non-hillside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| they can disturb up to 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| So that is for the whole site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Ah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Yeah. So if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| at the math there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| you can see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| the non-hillside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| the land disturbance factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| is 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| Okay. So they can only disturb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| 24.9 of the total 39.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Okay. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| I don't see any more hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| The next one's number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Also, Liz Albertson's the staffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| This is 1F21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| It includes a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| amendment and Barry Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| a different commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| than what was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Liz will walk you through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| So this is the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| of Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| This is west of Cache Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| and north of Wooddale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| In purple, you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| And then orange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| you can see Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| This is what the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| looks like for this stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4012)|

| 1:07:22| And the concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| you know, the Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| could turn into Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4045)|

| 1:07:35| dominant corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| So as part of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| these mixed-use special districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| were proposed along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4063)|

| 1:07:59| following the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4079)|

| 1:08:06| you can see that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| the mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| was sort of drawn to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| So these lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| these are actually two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| So there's this parcel here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| this parcel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| And so they're only recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| or only asking for an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4099)|

| 1:12:13| in the CA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| You can see a pretty wide array of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| from hotels to repair shops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| to restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| to storage facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:34| hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| storage yards for contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| so it's a pretty wide array of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| that would not come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| before this body for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| unless they were under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| the U category here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| that you see under the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| That's for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| This is what the planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| general description is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| I think most folks are familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| with this zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| but I just thought I would remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| that a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| for a planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| has to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| for the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| by approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| and would ideally provide us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| the option to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| some of the possible design issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| in the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:22| that we would not be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| to address under the CA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| So again, to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| what our recommendation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| rather than extending the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| to the rear portion of the parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| we are recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| that the entire parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| becomes part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| mixed use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| the EC06,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| which allows consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| of planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| and then we are recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| that the entire CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| or the entire parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| be rezoned to planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| rather than CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| and I'm sure there are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| Yes, thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| I think Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| had her hand up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| You can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| Liz, can you go back to the slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| that shows the current zoning of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| maybe this is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| everything around that parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| So am I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| everything around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| on three sides is agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| except that frontage of CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Okay, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| I just need to double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| I would like to really thank the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| for the different recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| we've seen today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| because I like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| where you guys are considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| like, I guess a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| or suggesting something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| rather than, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| just approve or just deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| And I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| that's what happened before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| but I just really like the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| I guess, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| the detailed amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| And not that you guys aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4524)|
| 1:15:24| I'm sorry if this is coming across wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| I'm just really, really happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| to see what you guys are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| And you're explaining it really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| and I'm understanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| And so just thanks for the explanations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| and for kind of walking through so well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| because I get it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Yay!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Commissioner Scott-Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Is there a building size limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| in planned commercials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Was it, like, 5,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| No, that's in neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Okay, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| did you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| I don't see any other hands up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| so we'll move on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| It's item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| It's S&E Properties 1G21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| It also includes a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| The request is for PR up to four dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| and staff is recommending a lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| and Liz will review that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| So again, this is the northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| of the intersection with Hardin Valley Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| and Marietta Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| right before Hardin Valley turns into Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| This is adjacent to the Massey Creek subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| This is what the slope area looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| You can see the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| from the sector plan noted on here by the hatching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| and you can see the FEMA flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| So you can see the back half of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| which is 6.98 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| A portion of it is within the floodway and the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| This is what the slope groups look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| So you can see the steep slopes going down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| to the stream or to the floodplain area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| So we did run a slope analysis for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| I will show that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| This is what the area zoning looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Again, you can see the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| that has been rezoned out in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| in the last 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| This is what the sector plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| So this area is already showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| in the sector plan as rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| as is this area behind it, Massey Creek, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| Everything to the south of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| still shows up as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| These were more recently rezoned than this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4698)|
| 1:18:26| and these have mostly already been built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| and fall within the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| for the rural residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| So when we were updating the Northwest County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| in 2016 for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| there were some changes that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| that I will go through related to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| there is some existing low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| and why there continues to be some rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| In this area, again, just a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| this is what the two land use classifications look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| Again, rural residential is designated for areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| that are within the rural area of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| and they're typically rural in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| They're also usually areas that are challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| by either steep slopes or floodplain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| and low-density residential is what we generally recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| for areas that are at densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| greater than five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| This is what the growth policy plan looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| So you can see this is well out in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| and the next slide are the changing policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| and conditions that I wanted to touch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| So Hardin Valley and the Northwest County sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| has been a little bit of a moving target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| because of major changes that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| to different policies and conditions in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| So from 2000 to 2010, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| there was an interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| proposed interstate connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| that was slated to go through this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| called the I-475 interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| and this was called the Orange Route at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| It would have cut right through this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| around Connor Creek and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| However, by 2008, I believe, or no, 2010 actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| TDOT decided to remove the Orange Route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| from their plans for an interstate connection in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| Also around 2000, the growth policy plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| and also around 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| Hardin Valley Elementary School opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| and it was placed right at the very edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| of the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| adjacent to the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| And then in 2008, Hardin Valley Academy opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| So this was shortly before they decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| to remove the Orange Route from those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| In 2016, we updated the Northwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| At this point, we knew that the Orange Route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| was no longer on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| and we made modifications to the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Again, this area would not have the Orange Route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| running through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| So it continued to show up as rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| in the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| and the areas that had been built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4905)|
| 1:21:50| at a rural residential density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| we, even if they had been rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| but they've already been built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| we put them back at rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| because they're in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| But if they had been recently rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| say within a year or two of the update of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| we left it as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| even if it was in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| or if they had also had a plat approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| for a density that was more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| that was above basically the two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| Then by 2018, Hardin Valley Middle School has opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| There's been an expansion of wastewater treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| by the West Knox Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| I think they've added capacity out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| by the Everett Road area to service all of this growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| We're seeing in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| We've also adopted the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| that gave specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| related to transportation issues in and around Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| And then also most recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| we now know that because of this growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| the West Knox Utility District and TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| are beginning outreach to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| the electrical network in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| So primarily because of the slope issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| and the floodplain issues for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| we are recommending planned residential up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| let me go back to the, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| planned residential up to two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| And we're recommending to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| the low density residential sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| so that the consideration for the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| would remain at or around two dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| and not greater than that, up to three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| So I think you received some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| from the Applicant's Council on this, Ben Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| and I'm happy to answer any questions you all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Oh, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5055)|
| 1:24:27| I have a fundamental question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| that applies to a situation like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| that we've seen throughout the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| at least since I've been on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| I don't understand how if the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| designates it as rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| that we can proceed legally to allow densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| that are greater than the rural density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| which would be in conflict with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| Can somebody respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Yeah, I'm happy to take a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Amy, you're welcome to jump in too, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| This is the section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| and Mr. Mullins highlights this in his letter to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| 3.5 allows consideration of extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| of low density residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| when the following conditions are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| So you would have to be rezoning to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| So it couldn't be RA or RB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| or one of the other residential zone districts in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| There needs to be a sewer and public water service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| which we know that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| And it needs to be on a connecting collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| or arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| I believe this is an arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Connecting up to the urban growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| or the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| So Hardin Valley does run up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| and touch the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| However, there is supposed to be also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| some sort of traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| demonstrating to the satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| that the effect of the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| or similar developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| in the traffic impact analysis zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| will not unreasonably impair traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| So it's not just a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| So in cases where we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| other rezonings that have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| and they have asked for a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| greater than two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| if they've asked for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| you know, section 3.5 to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| we generally have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| you know, a preliminary traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| impact analysis letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| that sort of states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| this is what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| This is what they think the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| you know, projected impacts would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| related to that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| but it's not a fine grained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| like we would see more with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| use on review applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| I, looking at this section, Liz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| I noticed it says allow extensions of low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| So wouldn't that mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| that it would have to be contiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| to an existing low density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| So, you know, I guess that is one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| that it could be interpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| You know, I think there are many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| that you could interpret this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| Again, you know, this is not adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| to low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| In our opinion, it is across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| from low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| but it is more adjacent to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| I think I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| I got a little confused there for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| So the existing density is what right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| So the existing zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| Asking to go to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| up to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| And however, Mr. Mullins's letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| has noted that the applicant is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| you know, with up to three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| I guess, but I'm sure he can tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| more about that on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| So I'm not sure if that's what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| On Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I will say there's also a greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| proposed for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| And that was noted in the recently adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Knox County greenways corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| that you may remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| So part of this area along the floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| with Connor Creek is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| for a greenway easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| That would connect up to Melton Hill Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| So that is something that during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| the use on review stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| regardless of what zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| you know, is recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| under planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| what density we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| will likely be asking for a greenway easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| in this area for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| And the county is aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| and they have asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| And then agricultural density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| is how much usually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| So agricultural zoning is one house per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| Seeing no hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5392)|
| 1:29:52| we'll move on to item number 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| which is 1H21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| The applicant is Taylor Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| Liz is going to provide you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| with a brief overview of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| because I think the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| is going to be requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| a slight modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| to their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| I'm going to try to pull this over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| to the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5410)|
| 1:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5427)|
| 1:30:27| Can you see KJS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5431)|
| 1:30:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| So this request is for a large area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| along John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| It's for an 84 acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| It's currently zoned RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| and there is some CA zoning in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| The primary reason we're going over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| is because though the applicant's application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| did ask for the entirety of this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| they have sent in an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| noting that they actually just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| this RA area to go to agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| and for the CA to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| So this is slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| They're asking basically for this to be cut out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| and they will likely bring this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| at the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| So they again are asking basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| the down zone to go from RA to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| Staff is supportive of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| but I just wanted to let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| that they have since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| submitting their application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| noted that they don't want this CA area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| as part of their rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| So that's really the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I'm mentioning them this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| because it probably won't be on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| and it may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| if they didn't have to pull it off for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| Mr. Korbely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| Yes, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Is there an existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| or use on the CA portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| No, there is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| Okay, now we'll move on to concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| Use on reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| So number 31 is 1D21UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| It's AmeriCorps Real Estate Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| Mike Reynolds is the staff on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| and he's going to review the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| Yes, thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| So I just wanted to go over this one real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| What they're wanting to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| is convert an existing Kmart store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| I guess former Kmart store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| into a U-Haul self-storage facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| indoor self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| This will also include external units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| that are located in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| I'll show you that here in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| One thing I just wanted to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| so this is up in the halls area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| Maynardville Pike is to the east side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| Neal Drive is on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| But this is part of a shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| There used to be a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| let me turn off the zoning here real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| but there used to be a Kroger located up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| in the northern part of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| It's long been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| Removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5608)|
| 1:33:28| So this shopping center is somewhat within transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| So this is where the self-storage facility wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| But staff doesn't necessarily have concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| with the indoor self-storage part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| converting the old Kmart store over to self-storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| And it also have the other services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| that U-Haul typically has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| like truck rental and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| But the indoor storage facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| I'll bring that plan up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| which are located in the parking lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| And then they have some more up here near Maynardville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| near the entrance of Maynardville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| into the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| This is the part where staff is actually recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| denial of those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| It's pretty atypical here in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| to have this type of use out in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| But in particular, in a shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| where we have other tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| that aren't associated with U-Haul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I think it really changes the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| of that shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| And so that's the main reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| for staff's recommendation for denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| of the outdoor self-storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| The indoor self-storage is what we're okay with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| They'll modify the exterior of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| to look like their more typical stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| You see these, I just want to point this out real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| but you can see these orange doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| that are across the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| Those are, they're just part of the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| They're not actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| you wouldn't actually open those doors up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| The indoor self-storage facility units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| they'll go through a main entrance door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| They would access their units from inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| They wouldn't access it from outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| There's a couple of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| that I just want to point out dealing with landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| One is that the indoor self-storage facility standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| does have landscaping standard along the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| So they would have to install some landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| along this frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| And then there's existing trees behind the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| for the most part here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| but on the northwest side of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| there's no landscaping that's adjacent to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| So that's a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| On the west side of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| there's no landscaping that's adjacent to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| So there's going to have to beef up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| some of the landscaping in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| And staff recommendation is just to bring that back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| staff, after, if they get approved to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| before they get permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| they have to bring a plan to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| We're also recommending that they install landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| within terminal islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| at the end of each of these parking rows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| The PC zone has a general standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| that says that if you have parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| in front of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| you can't yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| at least the parking lot needs to be landscaped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| so it doesn't feel like a wide open area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| So to help address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| we just recommend that they install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| some terminal islands with landscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| and some trees in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Any questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Any questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5798)|
| 1:36:45| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| Let's move on to item number 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| This is one you all are fairly familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I think it's 1G21UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| This is the Overby property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| Yes, this is the beer market proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| This is out here, Choteau Road and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| The existing markets at Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| are just to the north here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| And just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| obviously you see the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| to the south of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| There's a large property to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| southwest that is vacant at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| Then you get neighborhoods again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Obviously there's neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| off to the north and west here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| But let me bring up the plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| There's really not much from a staff perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| that we have concern with in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| There's only one condition that is substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| And it could be something that we address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| and permitting would be if they decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| to eliminate these exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| or accessory recreational amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| that they have that's got a small basket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| like a half basketball court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| a bocce ball court here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Let me zoom in a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| so you can see it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| There's a volleyball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| slash pickleball court back here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| So we're just recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| that if they do eliminate it for nighttime use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| that they either turn off the lights at 10 or dim them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| I talked to the architect on this project today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| and they indicated they don't plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| on eliminating those rec areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| So during the summer months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| they might be used a little bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| because the sun's out longer, warmer weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| And they didn't really anticipate anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| using them in the colder months anyways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| when the sun isn't out as long and it's colder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| and you really wouldn't be utilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| those facilities quite as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| So they're not really intending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| to eliminate those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| They might have some standard site lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| just so that they can see what's back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| but not really eliminate them for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| Just quickly, I mean, from a character standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| and compatibility standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| the location of the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| is about pushed pretty far away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| from adjacent property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| There is a waterline easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| that runs through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| That's pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| What they had to stay off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| The building is just one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| It is more of a modern structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| which I think is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| It doesn't, there's really no specific character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| to this area that they need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| The one story structure will help minimize the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| and it's not gonna be towering over anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| One kind of feature that they do have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| So there's only a small indoor facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| or a portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| So it's the building itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| is just under 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| The CN zone has a maximum of 5,000 square feet for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| The indoor condition space is 1,950 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| Then they have a more of a courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| I mean, it's an enclosed courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| that's just over 3,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| From the exterior of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| So what you're seeing with all the glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| that's the courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| It looks like part of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| but it will be open air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| You can see this like rectangular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| It's actually a hole in the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| So it actually give it quite a bit of a transparent feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| So the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| while it's bigger than some of the other buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| it won't quite have that same mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| that like a fully brick building might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6052)|
| 1:40:52| So it'd be fairly transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6060)|
| 1:41:05| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Yeah, I think actually it looks pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| My only deal is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| I guess somebody is sizing these trees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| That are adjacent to that existing residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| just to make sure they have as much privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| from this as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| It is that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| I saw a picture of the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| Does it go down that whole common property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| So what's actually happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| the open fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| you see here is actually the fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| that goes along the common property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| The more closed off or opaque fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| is up here along their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| I'll just go to the landscape plan real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| and zoom in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| But so along this Southeastern property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| there is pretty much a consistent line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| of evergreen plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| And there is some existing trees out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| that I believe that they're on the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| Actually, no, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| They're on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| What they're planning on doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| is trying to save those existing mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| If they can, if they can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| then they're going to supplement back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| to what you see on the landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| Oh, I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| So they're 30 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6139)|
| 1:42:19| Some of those hollies are 30 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| They're pretty tall trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| That's maturity height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| Yeah, that's maturity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Making sure they put decent sized plants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| in to protect these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| That's all I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| Yeah, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| I think the CN zone might have a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| for like minimum size at planting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| but probably not anything too substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6167)|
| 1:42:47| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Yes, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| You said that the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| well, it looks as part of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| that the garden area is actually open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| Did you mean those are like glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| maybe roll doors or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| that can be opened and closed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| Are they always open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| No, but I believe the glass is going to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| I'm just talking about the courtyard roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| You can see this triangular area in the roof here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| It's actually, that's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| That's an open air part of the roof there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| But I can tell from the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| the windows themselves are fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| They're not operable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| If they are operable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6209)|
| 1:43:29| then there might be some of them that open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| but by the looks of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| it's just, it's not garage doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6216)|
| 1:43:43| Okay, I see no more hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| So we'll move on to item number 37,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| which is 1C21SU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| It's Benjamin Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| on behalf of Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| Mike will give you an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| of their request to expand this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| This is an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| residential addiction treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| And they do everything from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| It's basically an alcohol and drug rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| They currently have both outpatient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| and residential inpatient uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| when they expand this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| they plan on moving their outpatient use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| to another facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| So this will just be an indoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| oh, I'm sorry, not indoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| a residential treatment facility only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| So people will stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| They won't be coming and going during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| As you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| there are some neighborhoods around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| To the east is another facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| that Helen Ross McNabb owns and operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| It's also a treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| Let me go to their plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| I just wanted to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| since this use could be a little more controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| just wanted to make sure everyone understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| I just took a look at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| Part of their plan is to include some new parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| on the northern part of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| closer to Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| That's really for overflow parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| For their building itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| they're gonna put a little over 2,000 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| addition on the front for six additional bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| Each bedroom will have two beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| Then there'll also be an addition on the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| 2,000 square feet for additional office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| And then they're gonna reorganize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| some of the spaces internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| to improve the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| There's one office space that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| I'm sorry, it's not an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| I think it is an office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| but they're gonna convert on the backside of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| to a bedroom, a three-room, three-bed bedroom, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| Let me go back to the last plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| Part of this, they're also gonna improve the amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| I guess, in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| and put in a walking trail, a gazebo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| It's kind of their concept at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| There is also a new fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| that's on the west side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| along Oak Bank Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| This site's a little unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Let me go back to the KGIS map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| In that it has three road frontages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| It has Ball Camp Pike, Matlock Drive, and Oak Bank Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| Oak Bank Lane, it's gonna, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| that's gonna be a corner side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| In the city's new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| a corner side yard, a privacy fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| which is what they're wanting to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| a six-foot-tall privacy fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| on this western boundary of their rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| It cannot be in the corner side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| A six-foot-tall open fence can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| which is basically anything with 50% opening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| so it's transparent, you can see into that yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| So there's a condition in here about that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| If they, there's a, they do need to install a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| a six-foot-tall fence according to the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| but if it's a privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| if they are ultimately able to install a privacy fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| they don't need to install additional landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| If it's an open fence, then they're gonna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| the condition states that they need to have landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| on the Oak Bank side of that fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| just to provide the privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| to both the facility and to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| over here on this, in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Commissioner Corbett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Yeah, so I was wondering the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| for the use to come into this building was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| did that have a review by planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| And if so, the fact that they're altering the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| by moving out the outpatients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| is that, if they hadn't even added to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| would just the change in use, increasing inpatients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| decreasing outpatients have triggered a review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| It was approved by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| through use and review prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| My guess is that it would trigger another review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| but I don't know that that's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| I think it depends on how the former review was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6508)|
| 1:48:37| So are we considering both the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| and the fact that the outpatients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| and inpatient ratio was changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| We are, yeah, we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| because the building is expanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| we are reviewing that part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| but it's also because of the expansion of the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| So yeah, so it's for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| Including the uses that are inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| the existing building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| That's why you see that the recommended approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| states both the total number of beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| and the total square footage of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| And it's one plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| there is also an existing small metal building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| little over 700 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| that they're going to convert to a group room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| It's noted in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| in the approval recommendation just to recognize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| but it's just a small room that they'll use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| I guess, for group meetings and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| Great, thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| So that concludes our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Does any commissioner have any other items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| they would like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Before we adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| I see no hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| Okay, well, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| Look forward to seeing you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210112-agenda-review?start=6603)|
