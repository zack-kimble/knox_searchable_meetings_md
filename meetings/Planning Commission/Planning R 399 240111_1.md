| 2:36:16| assumption of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| why the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| property was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9378)|
| 2:36:19| site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9379)|

| 2:36:23| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9383)|
| 2:36:24| know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9385)|

| 2:36:28| the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| assume with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9390)|
| 2:36:31| TDOT's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9391)|

| 2:36:34| do try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9396)|
| 2:36:37| issues, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9397)|
| 2:36:38| this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9398)|

| 2:36:43| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=9403)|

| 2:58:48| what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10730)|
| 2:58:51| liability and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| a trip hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| I suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10735)|
| 2:58:56| and view it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10737)|
| 2:58:58| because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10738)|
| 2:58:59| kill yourself, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| No seniors in my community who are gonna barely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10741)|
| 2:59:05| we can barely walk half of us anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| And when we do, we're walking up the block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| to the corner and back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| There were no people walking around our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| Each road is over a mile, mile and a half long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10756)|
| 2:59:20| It's not happening, that's the reality, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| But I think, aside from everybody else's support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| for this issue, you need to think about the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| because when I fall and break my hip, I'm suing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10771)|
| 2:59:35| Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| All right, let's see, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10780)|
| 2:59:45| That is to deny per staff recommendation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| Where we are, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| See, okay, okay, we're gonna do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| The motion and the second is to deny the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10796)|
| 3:00:01| to remove number six of case file 6-SA-22-C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10801)|
| 3:00:08| basically the requirement to build a sidewalk, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| That's, yeah, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10810)|
| 3:00:18| To deny building, the requirement to build a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10818)|
| 3:00:24| Well, deny the request to remove condition number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10824)|
| 3:00:27| remove the condition of number six of case file 6-SA-22-C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10827)|
| 3:00:33| requiring the installation of a pedestrian connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10833)|
| 3:00:40| between Mockingbird Meadows Drive and Hough Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10840)|
| 3:00:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| I wanna make sure we got time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| Let's make sure everybody's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| A vote yes is essentially for the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| of condition six, which requires construction of a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| So a vote yes, a vote no does not require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10861)|
| 3:01:07| No is no sidewalk, yes is a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| That seems backwards because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| The application is to remove a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| that requires it to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10874)|
| 3:01:15| And your motion was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| To deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| So I would be voting for the motion, which was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| I would be voting yes to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10884)|
| 3:01:34| One clarification off of this to Commissioner Boyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10894)|
| 3:01:38| she was asking about destroy or build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10898)|
| 3:01:42| The pictures that were going around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| there's something there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10904)|
| 3:01:47| It's not the final sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| but there's some type of basic infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| for the sidewalk already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10913)|
| 3:02:00| Who has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10920)|
| 3:02:01| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10921)|
| 3:02:13| To vote yes is for a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| To vote no is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10937)|
| 3:02:22| No sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| I hate to potentially throw in more confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| but if it is voted no, what happens to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| Is the request going to absorb that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| into adjacent properties or will that remain Knox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10954)|
| 3:02:39| Right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| Common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10961)|
| 3:02:46| Everybody ready for a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| All right, so you've heard the motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10968)|
| 3:02:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10974)|
| 3:02:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10975)|
| 3:02:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=10976)|

| 3:03:46| 6 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| 8-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11028)|
| 3:03:49| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11029)|

| 3:04:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11042)|
| 3:04:06| Bear with us just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| We're seeking some clarification on if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| needs further action here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| We need to approve the request to remove Commissioner Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11057)|
| 3:04:17| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11057)|
| 3:04:18| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11058)|
| 3:04:20| that we approve the applicant's request to remove the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| per the plan submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11063)|
| 3:04:27| That's right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| OK, we have a motion by Vice Chair Uten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| to remove the requirement, the applicant's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11079)|
| 3:04:42| to remove the requirement for a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| And we still have some discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| So Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11093)|
| 3:04:57| I guess I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| It has been platted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| The subdivision's been platted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11101)|
| 3:05:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11104)|
| 3:05:05| And so it's been platted with this opening, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11105)|
| 3:05:13| Is that like an easement, or is that an actual right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11113)|
| 3:05:17| opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| That's common area right now, the way it's platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11119)|
| 3:05:27| And so would that have to be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| I guess it can just stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11129)|
| 3:05:34| It could stay that way, or they could replat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| I mean, it's not a requirement to keep open space in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11136)|
| 3:05:39| or a common area in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| They could replat those lots and absorb that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11141)|
| 3:05:44| And then they'd have to get, they would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| replat those two lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11146)|

| 3:07:26| as identified on the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11246)|

| 3:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11259)|
| 3:07:39| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| Mr. Campbell, would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| I will go ahead and defer with this comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11263)|
| 3:07:47| We would appreciate going along with staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| The opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11276)|
| 3:07:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| Number one, I just want to thank you for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| and sacrifice to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| My name is April Atwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11284)|
| 3:08:05| I reside at 4618 Harrow Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11285)|
| 3:08:12| My property adjoins the property in the proposal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11292)|
| 3:08:19| So I'm basically spokesperson for the 103 residents that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11299)|
| 3:08:24| are opposing the proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| And so in short, I'm just going to read what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| I've prepared to help save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| So to the best of our knowledge, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| is the last property in Temple Acres neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| specifically Harrow Lane, Harrow Circle, and Daisy Main Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| area that is available for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| All the properties in the quiet surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11322)|
| 3:08:46| are single family dwelling and single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| The closest duplexes are not in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| but are located on a much busier McLeod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| The lot sizes in the area are quite large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| All the properties to the left, right, and across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| from 4608 Harrow Lane are nearly a full acre or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11341)|
| 3:09:06| We are concerned that by changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| the original subdivision designed lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| and allowing the only multi-unit complex in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| to be built, our property values would plunge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| Harrow Lane is the sole connecting street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11359)|
| 3:09:22| to Harrow Circle, meaning one way in, one way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11362)|
| 3:09:26| It does not have sidewalks and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| one of the few flat roads in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11368)|
| 3:09:31| Therefore, many people from the entire area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| ride their bikes, walk their dogs, jog, push strollers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11373)|
| 3:09:38| and allow their children to play on Harrow Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| It is the kind of safe neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| in which you would enjoy living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| We fear adding six living units will introduce potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| 12-plus cars onto a short stretch of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| not to mention numerous delivery vehicles coming and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| several times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| As a result, the above-forementioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11400)|
| 3:10:04| recreational activities may cease to exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| due to serious safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| We, the 103 undersigned, collectively and respectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11410)|
| 3:10:16| disagree with several comments on the recent use of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11416)|
| 3:10:21| report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| Development standards for use is permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| which state, number one, B, does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11426)|
| 3:10:30| impact existing neighborhoods and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| Number three, A, the proposed duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11433)|
| 3:10:37| are of similar character of neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11437)|
| 3:10:40| Number four, the use will not significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11440)|
| 3:10:43| injure or value the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| And five, A, a traffic volume in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| will not substantially increase as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| of proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| In response to the above, we strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| believe that building the three duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| on the acre lot of our subdivision, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| is comprised of only single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| will indeed impact the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| Firstly, duplexes are not of similar character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11469)|
| 3:11:14| with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11474)|
| 3:11:15| Secondly, our property values, in our opinion, will devalue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11475)|
| 3:11:20| And lastly, the traffic volume will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11480)|
| 3:11:23| be substantially increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11483)|
| 3:11:30| If these determinations are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11490)|
| 3:11:31| then the nearby residents are the ones who pay the price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| and our street and neighborhood are permanently changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| The staff study may possibly look logical on paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| but it does not consider the heart and soul of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| One has to live here to know the atmosphere of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11504)|
| 3:11:50| and we all want what is best for our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| in which we live, as we do in Temple Acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| Many of our residents have called this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| their home for over 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| We support the development of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| at 46018 Harrell Lane, but as a single-dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11526)|
| 3:12:10| single-family home, which is consistent to what already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11530)|
| 3:12:16| exists, at which point we would graciously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11536)|
| 3:12:20| welcome our neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11540)|
| 3:12:21| In submission, this issue is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| important to the residents whose names are affixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11543)|
| 3:12:27| which have been submitted through the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11547)|
| 3:12:31| in the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| And we just respectfully ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11554)|
| 3:12:36| consider the concerns of all those listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| Additionally, I'd just like to add as well, it seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11560)|
| 3:12:45| and I know this may sound repetitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| it seems logical that single-family homes should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| be built among single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| and duplexes be built in other duplex areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11571)|
| 3:12:55| But if these duplexes are built on this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11575)|
| 3:13:01| there will never be other duplexes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| would be next to said property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11583)|
| 3:13:07| The empty lot across, which is referred to in the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11587)|
| 3:13:11| there's an empty lot across, the homeowner actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11591)|
| 3:13:16| purchased that lot to be able to secure their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| so that no more development is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11601)|
| 3:13:24| And so that purchase was made in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11604)|
| 3:13:26| to secure that that wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| Ms. Hanton, we're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11611)|
| 3:13:40| First of all, I appreciate exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11620)|
| 3:13:43| the neighbors are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11623)|
| 3:13:44| And we're not trying to come in and do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| injurious to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| We do realize there are subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11629)|
| 3:13:52| that have duplexes and single-family homes in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11632)|
| 3:13:58| with each other scattered throughout those subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11638)|
| 3:14:02| And again, we're not trying to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| It is our opinion that we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| this a good neighbor situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11647)|
| 3:14:12| We, as you've seen from the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| have one access into the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| so that we're not having multiple driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11656)|
| 3:14:19| and some of the other issues that sometimes when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| multiple units, you create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11663)|
| 3:14:27| But again, I do respect what the neighbors are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11667)|
| 3:14:30| and understand this has been a stable neighborhood in Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11670)|
| 3:14:35| since I've been a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| So I understand exactly what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| But again, it's our opinion that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| would be a good thing for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| But again, that's up to you all to decide, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11687)|
| 3:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11691)|

| 3:15:40| to every developer that walked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11740)|

| 3:17:23| because it seems so similar to the one we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| approve the request for three duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11846)|

| 3:17:52| We'll adjourn, then I'll comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| Do I need to adjourn to talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11874)|
| 3:17:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| We are adjourned, but I would like to comment to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11878)|
| 3:18:02| We're going to be looking at the comprehensive land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11882)|
| 3:18:06| use and transportation plan next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11886)|
| 3:18:11| And we think it's a good idea that we have a workshop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11891)|
| 3:18:18| And unless anybody is objectionable to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11898)|
| 3:18:25| I think that we should proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11905)|
| 3:18:28| And we have identified two or three potential dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11908)|
| 3:18:32| Did you note those or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11914)|
| 3:18:35| I left them on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11915)|
| 3:18:36| But we have two or three dates identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11916)|
| 3:18:38| for the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| And I'm going to verify that we would have a location to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| and that our consultants could potentially come in as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| and participate in that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11926)|
| 3:18:48| And it may be, it will likely be between a two and three hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| event workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| Maybe Director Brooks might feed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11935)|
| 3:18:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11939)|
| 3:19:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| We'll definitely feed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| We got that negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11942)|
| 3:19:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11943)|
| 3:19:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11943)|
| 3:19:06| Look forward to seeing you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=11946)|
