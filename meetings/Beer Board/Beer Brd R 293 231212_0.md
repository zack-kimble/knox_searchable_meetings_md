| 0:03:19| going to be another restaurant maybe with a different name just curious I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| like to know. I have to say the management staff and the serving staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| and 100% of the kitchen wants to stay there so they will continue forward but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=208)|

| 0:03:47| asked when you move them back to Bearden. Guilty as charged. In fact if I may have the liberty to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=227)|
| 0:03:57| something I appreciate Officer Taylor because he has done so many things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=237)|

| 0:08:51| We actually got a building permit. We've got, we passed a couple of inspections, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| all we need is one more mechanical and we should be within two weeks of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| the okay, which is fantastic. All right. Good news. Well, do we have a proposal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=543)|
| 0:09:14| extend for 60 days or 90? Council Member McKenzie? We are going, well, even after we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=554)|
| 0:09:27| get the final, I don't, and it's going to be a little bit difficult right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| because it's the holiday season, so, you know, people are on vacation and stuff, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| a lot of the final things, but, and we're not going to open the first day on New| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| Year's Eve. That would be a nightmare. So, but we definitely should be up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| running by the middle of January and February, so a 30-day extension should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| fine. Yeah, I mean, it's going to be three weeks into it that this next beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| meeting would be three weeks into January then, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| About the third Tuesday. Yeah, this one's earlier, so it would be probably five or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| six weeks, six weeks. So, Ms. West, would you consider us maybe extending you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| for 60 days? I would. And then I'll be here with bells on in January. Well, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=619)|
| 0:10:28| wouldn't have to come, you wouldn't have to come before us then, so I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| move to extend 60 days. Okay. Second. All right. I've got a first and a second. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=631)|
| 0:10:40| discussion? Other discussion? All those in favor? Any opposed? So moved. Merry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=640)|

| 0:11:01| pass along to the board all his thanks for you guys working with him as he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| struggled to get open. All right, that's good news for them. All right, finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| we've got Yeehaw Brewing. Good evening, I'm Will Carver, attorney with Kramer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=673)|
| 0:11:24| Rayson in town, 800 South Gay Street, Suite 2500, and this is Mr. Ellis. Charles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=684)|

| 0:11:37| coming along. I have worked with Mr. Frost some, we've been working with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| other city departments. We initially thought we were going to need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| through a BZA process on a zoning appeal for permitted use within the area. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=705)|
| 0:11:55| Codes and Planning Office has been incredibly helpful in working with us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| an alternative to that, and so what I think is going to end up happening is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| Yeehaw, in this place where they're currently storing some beer, is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| run some online retail out of there, which assuages the concern about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| permitted use in this zoning district. What we're having to work with Codes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| right now is there's not parking adjacent to the building, so how are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| going to address that in the application? So we're continuing to work on it. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| city's been great to deal with. I've been very impressed with the desire to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| us find a solution to make the progress that we need to make to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| this. We're just going to need some additional time to get all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| accomplished. All right, you think 90 days? I sure hope 90 days would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=763)|
| 0:12:52| sufficient here, thank you. All right, I can't hear you. Oh sorry, I thought these were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=772)|
| 0:13:07| supposed to just pick up everything. I move that we extend for 90 days. I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231212?start=787)|
