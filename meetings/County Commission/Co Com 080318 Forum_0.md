| 0:00:00| I'm Scott Moore, I'm one of the commissioners out in the 7th District, which we're in tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=0)|
| 0:00:27| I'm with my colleague, Commissioner Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| What we think we'll do tonight is go ahead and start off and we'll let Mark's charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| petition folks here go first and explain the changes to the charter that they're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| And then we can take any questions and we can work through each and every one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=43)|
| 0:00:47| if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| But tonight it's your night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=48)|
| 0:00:50| Tell us what you want your government to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=50)|
| 0:00:53| And that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=53)|
| 0:00:55| So we'll let them go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| And we want to make sure that everyone gets to sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| So has everybody had a chance to sign in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| We'll get some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=66)|
| 0:01:14| And if you don't care, we did say this in the beginning, but if you can put what district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| you're from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| So we'll know if you're here from the 7th Commission District or someone else's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| And I'd like to introduce some commissioners right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Commissioner Larry Smith is my counterpart in the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| Commissioner Phil Ballard represents the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| Commissioner Elaine Davis, she serves as Commissioner in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=95)|
| 0:01:44| Commissioner Milo, he's Lumpy's brother in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=104)|
| 0:01:54| Commissioner Dave Wright in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| Commissioner Briggs out in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Commissioner Paul Pinkston from the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| Commissioner Victoria DeVries, also from the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| We've got a good crowd of commissioners out here in the halls tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| So without delay, we'll go ahead and let the charter petition folks present their amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=133)|
| 0:02:24| Good evening, I'm Jim McLean, and I live in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| That's South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| Do you welcome South Knoxville people this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| Everybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Don't have to have a pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| And Paul Pinkston's not a commissioner, but I have authority over Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| Because I'm his 7th District teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Does that count, Carol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Let me very quickly give you an historical background of where we are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| and where I met the Muncie County Commission last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| I'll stop a little short of that because some recent things have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| that really have been exciting and good news for both the Commission and for the Charter Petition Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| But back in the year 2000, some of you will remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| the nine counties, one vision was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| And on January 12, 2007, an outgrowth of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| well, there was a, first of all, a Supreme Court in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| Jordan and the Knox County made it clear that for the first time in Knox County's 215-year history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| we can have whatever form or structure of local government that Knox County citizens approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=218)|
| 0:03:45| Then, on April 18 of last year, a process called the Knox County One Question was launched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=225)|
| 0:03:53| which was organized by some of those former leaders of the nine counties, one vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| And the 56 citizens from all over Knox County came to answer one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| What changes, if any, do the citizens want to make to the form or structure of government in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=245)|
| 0:04:15| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| We had five public meetings at that time, one here at Holmes and Beardman Carter, Southville, and Fullerton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| Meanwhile, the Baker Research was doing research for us on public policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| and they compared Knox County with 160 similar counties around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| And they mentioned several things when they published local government in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| what citizens need to know, but I think I can pass by that because it will be covered in a little bit later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| Then a sixth public meeting was held on August 14, 2007, to obtain reactions to the Baker Center findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=291)|
| 0:05:00| On September 9 of last fall, the 56-member Knox County One Question Steering Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| publicly released its unanimous final report and recommendations together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| with suggested language for Knox County Charter amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| all of which had already been legally researched for constitutionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Then on September 9 and to January, things were sort of calm and quiet in relationship to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| and we certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| They had lost eight commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| The 4th District had no representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| So things had to sort of be quiet at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| At that point, we had proposed two petitions in case we couldn't get where we wanted to be with those nine recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=340)|
| 0:05:52| But then, on February 25, this past February, the Knox County Commission voted on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=352)|
| 0:06:01| to put seven of the nine proposed charter amendments on this coming August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| However, as I mentioned earlier, things have arisen at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| and I will let Ms. Edith MacLeod explain that, and we'll go from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Before Edith gets up here, does anybody have any questions about what he's already said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| Yeah, the Baker Center, who are the people involved in the Baker Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| That's a UT, University of Tennessee group that formed, and they did the research, but that's as far as they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=395)|
| 0:06:44| They are not behind recommending anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| They merely did the research for the Knox County one question at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| See, we were ad hoc committee because once we made our recommendations, we disbanded on September 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| But then, when it came back up to where we would proceed with these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| we then became the Knox Charter Petition Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Same people, but ad hoc means it's work had finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=435)|
| 0:07:26| We made that report at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| I was also very reluctant to do that for a very long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| and I find that very disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| How do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Well, I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| I just know that when you need seed money, you go ask folks that have been so generous to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| All that's a matter of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| I did a little research myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| I don't know if you realize, but there's 1,959 tax-exempt nonprofit organizations along in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=467)|
| 0:07:55| They have $8 million worth of income, or $8 million worth of assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| and $3 million worth of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| That makes me a little nervous, to a certain extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| because I kind of feel outgunned in this whole situation when you say we're going to the grassroots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| and that's not grassroots to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Well, grassroots comes later when you get to the point that you have to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| and we will ask not the people with the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| and you've probably seen from the record of those who have given $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| and those are philanthropists, but then it will be even more grassroots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| when we'll be seeking and hoping for $25 donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| But all that, there's nothing to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Everything is open and will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| Well, I can appreciate your nervousness, but your questions and concerns will be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| I'd just like to say that when you need money, you go to the people that have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| You don't go to the people who don't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| I don't feel intimidated in the least by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| I'm glad that we do have people who will come forward and will give their time and their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| and to offer this to the citizens to ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| because each person that has donated money is only going to have one vote on this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| just like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| So I appreciate the fact that we have people that will come forward and make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| We should be thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Money bought the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| You say that nationally, locally, statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Money bought the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| This is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| Okay, do we have any other questions so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Okay, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| I have this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Is there any direction on how the 56 citizens that made up the Knox County One Question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| how they were picked and or selected to be on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| I was called in to ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| I would be interested in serving on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Maybe because I'm a former elected official, but most likely because I live in San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| Do you have any hint on how the other people will be on this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| I think at the commission they talked about it started with five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=608)|
| 0:10:17| And they made some phone calls and created this group out of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| Okay, this time we'll introduce Edith McMann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=625)|
| 0:10:33| I'm Edith McMann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| I reside in District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| I live on Cunningham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| And I have lived there for 54 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=641)|
| 0:10:50| I guess that some of you are interested in how these amendments were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=650)|
| 0:11:01| And I can go back in the history and give you some information in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=661)|
| 0:11:09| There were sessions scheduled in five locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Halls High School, Bearden High School, Carter High School, South Door Mills, and Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=673)|
| 0:11:22| This was in regard to the nine counties one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| The attendance at those meetings was not confined to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Because they were scheduled at staggered times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Because some people could not attend one session, but they could attend any one of the five sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=697)|
| 0:11:47| There was a sign-in sheet for people who attended to sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| We have the attendance of those who signed in, but many people chose to not sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=713)|
| 0:12:04| So it does not represent the total number of people who attended those sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| There was a general session explaining the general organization for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=732)|
| 0:12:24| And then those sessions were broken up into smaller groups of ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| And at that time, they discussed the things that they wanted to see changed in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| And at the end of their session, they chose, by vote of the group, three top interest areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=760)|
| 0:12:51| Three top things that they wanted to change in county government from that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| Then they went back into the general session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Those three top items from each of the groups was reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| And they again chose the three top groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| For example, in Halls High School, they chose the three top groups from all the general sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=796)|
| 0:13:24| Then in the end, those three top groups from each of the five sessions across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=804)|
| 0:13:33| was taken by the Steering Committee of Nine Counties, One Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| And from that information, these amendments were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| I will take each amendment and give the information according to the ordinance as it was filed with the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=825)|
| 0:14:00| If you want to discuss each one as it is presented, or if you want to wait until I go through all seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=840)|
| 0:14:11| we're talking about the seven that remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| There were two that did not pass the first reading, so there are seven that have passed the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| The first amendment was establishing the number of signatures required for a citizen-driven charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=863)|
| 0:14:34| And the information in regard to the filing with the Election Commission says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=874)|
| 0:14:44| voters of the county may frame and propose amendments to this charter by a petition addressed to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=884)|
| 0:14:55| Any petition proposing a charter amendment must be filed with the county clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| and must be signed by qualified voters of the county equal in number to at least 15% of the persons who voted in the last gubernatorial election in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=902)|
| 0:15:15| The county clerk shall immediately deliver said petition to the County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| When the County Election Commission determines that such petitions are legally sufficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| it shall submit to the voters of the county in accordance with Section 9.05E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| So, that is the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| So, that is the position at which we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| This, in order for it to be approved, it has to have two-thirds vote of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=943)|
| 0:15:52| in order for these amendments to be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| The second amendment, which is the second amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| in order for these amendments to be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| The second ordinance...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Do you have any questions about this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| The Commissioner has asked that I state each one separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| Are you planning to go ahead with the signatures if they don't approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Yes, if they are not approved, it will be placed on signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| Brad, would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Well, there's just one recent event that's very important for this entire group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| I'm Brad Held, by the way. I'm a resident neighbor of yours here in 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| Yesterday, Dr. Briggs made a motion that was approved, as I understand it unanimously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| by two different committees to form a Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| which is something we didn't anticipate, yet we think is something that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| To combine that with the fact that we can now have ballot initiatives on the November ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| or the August ballot, two wonderful moves have kind of come to fruition in short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| So everything Edis is going through will be put through a process at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| I don't know the timeline, but a process with a third group that the County Commission has approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| the creation of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| And so our committee in particular, some of these amendments Edis is going through tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| we've already discussed potential changes that make them more palatable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| But how we plug this into the conversation, and I'm not supposed to be a part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| but I'd be glad to, there are changes that may change minds here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| it may create more questions, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| It may change commissioners' opinions about certain amendments, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| Specifics that we can go through, and either Gary or myself can go through those potential changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| but they are just potential after all the public input and input from commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| But this new Charter Review Committee is going to throw a nice curveball into this mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| to where we'll have, I guess, at least 19 members, possibly more on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| open meetings, time to breathe, time to take in the ramifications, legal and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| And it does kind of throw a curve into tonight for at least the presenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| who are presenting something that might not exactly be the end product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| I think Dr. Briggs may be better to talk a little bit about the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| I don't know that we're even really sure what the process is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1136)|
| 0:19:06| Let me first explain why I decided to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| or I think we as a commission decided to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| is that we were really running up against a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Next Monday, on March 24th, we were going to have the second reading of these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| And once the second reading occurs, they're going to be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Also, the Charter Petition Committee group had a deadline really of March 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| when they were going to start their petition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| And they may start it anyway, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| But see, we were really running up against a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| I think we were told that they were going to start that on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| One thing that came out of the workshop, I think it's the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| was a helpful interpretation that we could go on the ballot in November by petition drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| which allows everything to sort of slow down quite a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| I think which is a welcome thing for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| We are waiting on written confirmation from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| I think, just so everyone knows, is that there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| and I'm not sure we have the final legal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| but it was clear that if you obtained the required number of signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| you could be on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| For the November ballot, it wasn't clear whether by petition you could put the amendments on in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| and I think the lawyers are still trying to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| The commission can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| If there's two readings where the amendments pass, they can go on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| I think there are some advantages to having them on the November ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| because there'll be more public participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| because there's going to be more people voting in the presidential election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| because there's a lot of interest in that, rather than in the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| I mean, I'd like to think that everyone wants to be interested in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| but we have to face reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| But what it does, it allows the whole process to slow down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| and for us to look at it and really try to get these amendments right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| If, for whatever reason, we start the petition process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| put these on the ballot in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| and I think, and I could point these out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| I have some that we want to go through detail to detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| where I see some wording problems, and some of these may be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| but once they're on the ballot and once they're passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| they're part of our charter, and it's very difficult to reverse it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| We can talk about these as we go through some of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| and I think probably you'll agree that some of these could do a little tuning up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| but I think the time to do that is before we have them on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| and before we have them as part of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| because then it's really hard to undo something that we didn't do right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| The executive committee of the Knox Charter Petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| O'Harnon supports your effort to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| You've run such a time, the time that you said, that November is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| I think for this to be successful, the Charter Review Committee to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| there has to be elements of trust and conciliation really on both parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| and on people who are very much against all the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| and for people who are obviously advocating for the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| and I think the concern on the part of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and some of the members of the commission and some members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| is some of this was being rammed down our throats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| and I think the concern from the charter petition group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| was that this is just another stalling technique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| and they're trying to do something to kill this without it really coming before the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| and I think by having the Charter Review Committee look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| it allows both sides to sit down and see if we can't make these things better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| so when we do have the final product, the final amendments to go before the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| it'll be something that the public can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Some of the amendments have two parts, and one part hasn't been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| and I can give you examples as we go through these this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Some have wording that I think is very confusing and could result in lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| and I think it's just best that we put the best amendment forward for the public to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| and that's why I suggested that at the committee meeting yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| I think he's had his hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| Could you just explain the process for appointing a Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| and how that happens, just so we all understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| My understanding of what's involved in the process is that we made a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| to ask the mayor to appoint a Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and the way that process is done is that he'll appoint one commissioner from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| and then there's a minimum of two citizens from each district that also will be appointed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| He'll appoint more than the two from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| When I talked to him the other day, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| well, I'm thinking about 23 citizens from each district, and that would make 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| I'm hoping my math works out right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| It'd be a total of 27 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| In that way, if we have committee meetings like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| and then we're looking back at these Charter Review Commissions that we've had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| there's always people that can and can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| but we want it to be a fairly large number rather than having half the people not attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| and then only have maybe 9 or 10 people there trying to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| My question was, who gets to decide the world once it's actually brought to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| In other words, in respect to the abilities, I don't know if this is a question for the mall director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| but I'm just concerned about the actual ability of what actually goes on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1472)|
| 0:24:41| a proposed amendment, because, again, what's brought before it as far as a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| and what goes on the ballot, I know if I put something on a petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1487)|
| 0:24:56| and it's not what I'm voting for on that day, I'm talking a lawsuit myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| So I need to know who gets to decide the actual ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Well, we're talking about two different processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| With the petition, they take the petition, and I think it has to be certified by the Election Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| and then they go around and get all the signatures, and whatever's on that is what goes on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| Now, what we're talking about here is having a Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| and they'll take these amendments to the Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| and we'll have the commissioners and the citizens that are appointed to that committee review all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| with consultation with probably the county law director and maybe the attorney from the Charter Petition Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1532)|
| 0:25:42| and then they'll be certain that the language is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| And then what I would foresee happening is that they bring it back to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| and see, then the commission has to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Now, the commission still has the right to make amendments to it, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| The final authority for what goes on the ballot through the commission process will be decided by the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| So what we would hope is that that's all been worked out before we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| But the commission still, I think, Mr. Law Director, Professor Gregg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| I think the commission still would have the right, even if it's brought there, to make amendments and changes and then vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| Dr. Briggs has been reading our Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| One, the attorneys have talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| I've talked to the petitioner's attorney, and Mr. McAdams has come around to my way of thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| and you can certainly have a petition on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| So that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| The one thing that that does, though, it will change at least one of the amendments that is currently lodged with the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1599)|
| 0:26:50| with the election commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| There's one of the amendments that basically says you're going to have appointed offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| That's the one that's caused the most excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| And with that amendment, the way it's structured now, if it passes in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| if it were to be on the August ballot and pass, the effective date would be September of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| That would effectively reduce the term of the law director and the property assessor to two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| Now, if it goes on the November ballot, you're probably looking at four-year terms for the law director and property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1641)|
| 0:27:29| So those will have to be addressed at some point through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| As far as the charter review committee, I've been through a couple of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| and the charter review committee can consist of 27 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| It's no more than two citizen resident registered voters from each district in addition to one commissioner from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1668)|
| 0:27:58| So I would look for that in the next couple of days for the mayor to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| It sounds like he's in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| But that's one of the ways that you can get an issue on the ballot from the others that Dr. Briggs has described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| The ballot question itself will be written by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| If it's written for the November ballot, that will be somebody other than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| If it's written for the August ballot, that will be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| But the law director has the responsibility of writing the ballot question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| There's two petitions that have been filed by the petitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| Actually, there are more, certainly more in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| But the two that contain, one contains five amendments and one contains four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| they are so lengthy that I've expressed my concern that the ballot question will look like nothing more than bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| So it doesn't give you a whole lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| We're limited to 300 words or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| So get it all said in 300 words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| And you can pretty much take the captions of those and you've just about got your 300 words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| So I know the group is looking at filing just one or two amendments at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| which would make the ballot questions much, much better to read and give the voter much more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| To answer one point, if the November ballot is definite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| then the not-for-profit group has voted to withdraw the petitions from the August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| the ones that are supposed to be for the election commission next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| So if we have, and we just had a talk to Mr. McAdams today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| but if we have indeed confirmed that the November ballot is a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| we would absolutely prefer to be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| We would absolutely prefer that the commission do it or this charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| So if that's the case, you'll see us remove the petitions as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| Can I make one more point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| We asked, and just while you're up here, and I believe this is correct too from what I've read in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| there's a third way to put an amendment on there, and that can originate out of the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Oh, the mayor can't put an amendment on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| No, it originates out of the mayor's office and it comes down to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| The mayor establishes, basically the mayor appoints the persons to fill the charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| and that committee is confirmed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| No, I'm talking about putting an amendment on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| No, the mayor cannot put an amendment on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| The mayor can be involved in an ordinance just like anyone else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I thought you were referring to the mayor's office, and then it goes to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| The commission can pass by ordinance, and that takes two readings, an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| which is the process that the commission is going through right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| That's one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| You can have a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| That's the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| The mayor is involved with the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| These are actually of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| The mayor chooses who's going to be on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| determined by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| The third way is the petitioner's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| You get the number of registered voters that voted in the last election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| and you can put the amendments on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| I have asked Tom McAdams, if those ballot questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| if the questions that have been filed are going to get their return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| I have asked him to take a stab at writing a ballot question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| so I'm anxious to see what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| In their current form, it's pretty hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| I didn't answer one of the original questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| about who's going to be on the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| The mayor will appoint those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| and I believe that has to be approved within five days by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| Part of the reason they're not having that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I really don't know where that stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| but part of the reason you're going to see some delay in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| is that the commission meeting is on Monday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| I think the mayor wants to announce that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| so it falls within that five days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| so we don't have to be convening a special commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| on Saturday or Sunday to get that approved within five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| I think that's what the mayor intends to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Has there been an evaluation done on the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| particularly what's number one to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| in your own surveys and research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| and what's the last and most important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Even a meeting like this, I think, is just a sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| I was talking with Commissioner Pink before this started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| and even we have approved right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| and this represents just a fraction of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| that live in the 7th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| but it does give an idea about what the community is concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| I don't know if this gives any idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| because we can argue about every one of these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| but the 7 of the 9 we passed at the commission meeting in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| during the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Four of those passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| People are confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| and probably half the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| we had like 70,000 short on the last election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| and I was standing with the big turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| I would say that half of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| had no idea what they were voting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| and I'm not trying to be negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| Are you talking about the candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| I'm talking about people that actually vote in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| and they're eager to know what they're voting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| like most counties in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| They really are a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| So why not have a few amendments for the next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| and simplify the matter for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| and we can go with four amendments that are very important in our lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| because it's not going to end this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| it's going to keep on continuing going like that for 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| This is just an idea only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| but why not pick up three or four amendments that pertain to those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| and then move forward with the 2010 ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| I think they'd have to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| No, I was just going to try to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| and try to keep us on some type of time schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| to see what you all want us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Do you all want to listen, basically, to the nine ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| more than how it was created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| or do you want to continue on just hearing the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| And I'll say something about my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| I only voted at county commission for one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| I voted against the rest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| because I didn't have the information that I believe is important for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| to have information and knowledge to know what we're going to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Let me remind you of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| There's never been a charter amendment passed by county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| without a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And last month, seven of them passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| without commission having a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| It was because there's a lot of pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| By the new Sentinel, just let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Let the people vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| And, you know, I talked to a lot of people in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| talked about 1994 when people voted for term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Well, people today still think they term limited everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| But, you see, you cannot term limit your United States congressman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| and your United States senators, your state reps, your state senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| your school board people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| But when people went to vote in 1994,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| they voted on the ballot to term limit every elected official in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| So, we have to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| to make sure that everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| what they're going to be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| But this is your government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Make no mistake about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| And we need to run it the way you all want us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| You hear some nice little catch words like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| take your government back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Your government hasn't gone anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| We're here to represent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| We're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Sometimes it may seem like we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| But I think a lot of us spend a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| trying to make sure that all the citizens of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| have a part in their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| So, you had a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| As I understood it, when the vote last vote was cast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| in the county commission on these different amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| it wasn't an up and down vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| on whether or not the individual commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| supported the amendment or rejected the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| as much as it was a directive on their part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| to allow it to be voted upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| by the consensus of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| So, the commissioners by their yes votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| weren't showing that they supported any given amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Right. A lot of them said...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Should be voted upon by the county voters alone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| My take on it was that the commission basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| wanted to get some of them out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| or get them out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| so that we could have more public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| and begin really the public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| of educating and informing the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| So, yeah, I think you're right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| I don't think an affirmative vote on the first amendment...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Yeah, it didn't mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Because some of the commissioners talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| they were for some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| and they would be against the other ones on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| But they wanted the people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| But certainly when things that are going to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| basically changing the constitution of our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| and, you know, little words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| can play a large part in our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| to stop changing the school board districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| to meet with county commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| You know, that all sounds great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| but I don't think anybody ever looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| to see if a school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| would have a school in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Or somebody may have 12 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| and somebody else may have 3 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| You know, but nobody could answer that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| from the charter...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| But that's what you all had for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| And we brought some questions up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| and some wording up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| and then they started changing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| and said, well, if we're willing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Instead of the first meeting they came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| and said, either they will not change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| or they will go with their petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Scott, as I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| when you were appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| and I have to go back to all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| but as I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| you specifically said people wanted to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Everybody wanted to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| And you said because of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| and what it's sort of charged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| you know, we can't allow them to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Okay, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| But now, there's really nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| because there's nothing in any charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| or anything that says that people can't vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| if you all give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| the permission to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| And that's all that people are asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Well, I think you want to see people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| we want to see everybody vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| But we want to make sure that we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| legally because we don't want to end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| people vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| and come back the next year and say, good gosh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| what did we vote on? We didn't know we were voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| So unless you're educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| we've got to educate the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| we just can't let people stick things on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| on this government to change our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| because, I mean, this letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| if you look at the people who donated money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| and we've already talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| anybody who wants to donate money can donate money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| no problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| But the problem I have with it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| is that the people like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| people that I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| my friends, they don't have $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| to give to their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| So when someone puts on a full-fledged campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| or something, and there's a bunch of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| people over here that has no money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| their message is not going to get out as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| as somebody that's got $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| And this is a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| that was sent out, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| 21st Century Mortgage Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| has probably already donated about $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| And you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| bullet points that they talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| is eliminating empathism and conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| of interest. I think everybody in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| would say, I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| You talk about eliminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| misplaced problem abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| everybody in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| is for that. If you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| utilizing $8.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| in county fees more effectively each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| there's nobody in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| that would be against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Make commission more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| responsive by voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| for 3 of 11 commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| rather than 2 of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Well that sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| real good to us. We get to vote for 3 instead of 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| Except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| you could take West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| by itself basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| and you could lose every other precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| in Knox County and you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| start out with 3 commissioners from West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| out of 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| I mean that's something that is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| It may not happen, but it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| So, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| and then make the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| more accountable by streamlining the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| branch in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| after 2010. We've just seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| I think that pays people more accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| and for streamlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| but the wording is that the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| would appoint all the fee officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Now you get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| wording and people go thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| they're going to vote for more accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I'm for accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| but then after the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| and it passed, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| well shoot I didn't know I can't vote for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| assessor and the registrar of deeds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Yeah but man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| there's a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| that go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| every morning and take their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| to school and come home and play ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| and out here in the softball and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| baseball fields and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| they go vote but they may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| be up to date on exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| what it is and they go in there and read something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| that says to make the mayor more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| accountable. Well I'm for that, vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Well all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| but we're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| helping. Each of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| vote in every election. They're either educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| or uneducated. Everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| is relative and that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| whether somebody rigs a thing or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| you can't be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I think Dr. Briggs already hit on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| but his initial statement was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| that the wording of all of these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| need to be clarified and need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| streamlined to where the average voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| isn't in the left field and comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| on and tries to interpret exactly what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| amendment is saying. And that's what needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| be done and that's what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| You heard the law director say some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| talk about 300 words or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| it's going to be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Anybody here that voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| in the last election and saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| the length of that ballot, there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| people lost inside the voting booths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| and that's the last thing you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| to get into is where you're disarranging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| your advertising voters because they either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| don't understand it or just say to heck with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| and don't vote at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| And while I'm on a soapbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| everybody look around this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| and look at the mean age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| of the people in this room right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| And Mr. Owens, I don't know if we can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| or not, but I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| to make a move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| within the school system, within the high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| to invite high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| students, they may have one high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| student from each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| to be a part and or sit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| on the charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| because, let's face it folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| we're all not volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| but in the age of post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| we're going to be turning this county over to the young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| and unfortunately there's no young people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Okay, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Alex, you got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Hi, if we can help you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| if you all don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| This meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| the mayor will appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| would the citizenry be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| to come to those meetings without any input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| They can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Without or with input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| They'd be open meetings and you'd have time I'm sure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| voice your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| either for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Yeah, you can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Okay, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Everybody in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| can sit and look at this right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| this is a misrepresentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| of what was done in Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| I was there, I know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| issues with this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| at different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| but we do have a representative of democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and it is their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| to make sure whatever is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| for this county is done in the correct way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| the group that's pushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| to pass that form knows it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| So look at this guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| That's what happened in Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Let me say one thing before Mr. Knapp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| can answer some of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| At commission there were some people who said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| they had attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| some of the forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| and they said we never got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| we never seen this question. Some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| didn't come out of the forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| they come out of the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| And I guess the steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| or executive committee voted to put these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| into an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| into an ordinance to put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| So not everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| that this group says came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| citizens driven. Some of it came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| from the Baker Center as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| So I'll let Edith Knapp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| comment on that and then we can continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| We do need to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| I would like to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| about the fact that the sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| that he held up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| misrepresented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| what happened at Hollis High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| That is certainly not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| true. In each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| these small sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| a moderator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| a facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| and there was a scribe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| and there were large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| pieces of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| poster paper put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| around the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| and each suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| each comment that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| was written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2763)|

| 0:46:55| Well there was no preset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2815)|

| 0:46:59| for that one young lady. I don't know who she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2819)|

| 0:47:09| and that person did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| a preset agenda. They secured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| it toward a certain area. I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2833)|

| 0:47:21| on and let's get through the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| and then we can have time to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| I don't want people to get up and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2845)|

| 0:47:49| thing that was said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| and then asked the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| who had made the comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2873)|

| 0:48:03| individual to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| that nothing was written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| had been said. There was nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| added and that all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| these things were taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| from the poster paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=2897)|

| 0:51:35| partisan, not non-partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Restructuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3097)|

| 0:51:41| one representative per district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3101)|

| 0:51:45| tighter terms in partisan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3105)|

| 0:51:55| Who did the committee ask before they changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| I got a problem with the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| changing one to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| regardless of who I'm voting in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| I mean, the committee may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| had changed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| it didn't ask nobody to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| I got a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Brad Hill, would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3133)|

| 0:52:21| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3141)|

| 0:52:25| we've been accused of inflexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| two or three weeks we've listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| to a lot of great ideas about improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3151)|

| 0:52:37| can prevent much bigger problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| down the road from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| So we want to take legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Commissioners have certainly offered their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| There's been South Knoxville public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3165)|

| 0:53:17| worth keeping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=3197)|

| 1:38:12| And third, ultimate appointment by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| The Inspector General shall serve a term of six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| at which time the appointment process will occur again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| However, there are no restrictions on reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| The salary of said Inspector General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| is hereby fixed as the same salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| as the law director and payable in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| The commission shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| using the advice of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| and review of successful Inspector General functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| and other similar communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| set a budget for said office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| to pay all reasonable and necessary expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| such as the employment of additional personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| by the Inspector General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| The commission shall provide suitable offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| and conveniences for the Inspector General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| and his or her personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| The commission shall also furnish the Inspector General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| with appropriate equipment, furniture, and supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| as may be necessary in the performance of his or her duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| Now, if this is helpful to your offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| it's likely to be helpful to that committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| So nobody lays their hands on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5965)|
| 1:39:34| Can we put in the recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| If you allow someone...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| If you allow someone to supervise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| and I have a boss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| and every time I roll him up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| I spent three days trying to calm him down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| because he was ready to fire me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| I had to walk that line between getting fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| and then write him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| But I still roll him up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| and I sit on the verge of getting fired every time I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| But you need somebody independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| like an election official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| that has to be voted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| I want more justice and more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| I know what that job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| As soon as I rolled that guy up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| I was going to suffer for at least three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| I know something about that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| I did it several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Maybe instead of having so many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| more people that you have around you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| and more politicians than I have going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| it would seem to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| that sometimes a civil service situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| would work better so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| somebody couldn't snide you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| just because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| they didn't like the color of your clothes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| or your, you know, daddy or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| I think that would work a lot better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| than trying to arrest everybody's brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| I think this is an excellent amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| and I heard Dr. Briggs explain what the duties were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| and I think it would be good to have him explain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| because that way everybody gets treated fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| not just one office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| Dr. Briggs, would you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| I can explain what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| but I can't explain the potential for these problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| but in two, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| The inspector general, and I'll give you two examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| One is the way we have inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| and the other is what the inspector general reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| in a large organization like, you know, like TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| And really what the inspector general does in the Army,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| he's the eyes and ears and really the hands of the commander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| In other words, he goes out in all the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| He can't be everywhere all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| but what he does is that he goes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| and he'll be certain that all the rules are being followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| the regulations are being followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| the paperwork's being done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| If there's a complaint that something's not being done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| he'll go and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| But what he's really trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| he's not the fire inspector that goes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| after the building's burned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| and found out what went wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| in terms of what our Office of the Internal Budget does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| And I think Richard Walz is an excellent job, excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| But he also is trying to prevent those problems from ever occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| What the commander wants in the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| he doesn't want these problems to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| He wants it done right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| For instance, in TVA, there's an inspector general also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| but I've talked to Tom Kilmore, who's the CEO of TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| and what's very important, and it's not stated in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| is who he really reports to and who he's responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| He's the eyes and the ears of who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| And, for instance, in TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| the inspector general reports back to Congress and not to the CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| And I think it would probably be, this is my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| I think it would probably be a more powerful inspector general at TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| if he reported to the CEO, who could then fix things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| and find out what's going on in his organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| And I think that's something that we may want to define a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| I like the idea of the inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| but it has to be someone, in my opinion, who's apolitical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| who has an impeccable reputation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| who's not necessarily just an auditor, but he's much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| He's a systems manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| You know, many...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| And he needs to be someone who can go into any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| See, he can go into any office and look for problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| not just these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| He can even go into some of the elected offices, some of the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| in these circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| I'm just going to give an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| because the final mayor's response isn't out yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| but I would hope that he would have been in there looking at some of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| and maybe finding that the procedures were being done before there was a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| And you may have said this, and I might have missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| And I'm not asking you to tell me how you would vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| but just how you would lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Do you feel that that position is such a position of importance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| the IG position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| And I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| that it should be elected with qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| The...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| It...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| I have mixed feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| I've heard some of the people...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| You know, some of the people on the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| give some pretty persuasive arguments about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| But I would really almost like to have that position above an elected office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| because when it's elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| if you remember what I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| the first word I said was apolitical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| And when you elect someone, it becomes political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| And, you know, there's issues that people on this Commission have brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| that I hadn't thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| that if you really ask my preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| I would like to see this upstanding person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| who's not only an accountant who can audit things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| but he's a systems manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| he's an efficiency expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| I am concerned maybe how much the whole office is going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| compared to what the Office of the Internal Budget costs right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| But I would like to see someone who...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| We can get our money back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| by finding that other things...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| We've got too many people working in this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| We shouldn't be replacing this with computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Let's get the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| You know, let's get the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| You know, paying our bills, paying our taxes by computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| There's a whole host of things you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| To follow up, I have worked with both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| And I can promise you that appointed does not necessarily mean apolitical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6342)|
| 1:45:49| I know, but that's a difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| And it also depends on who the guy's boss is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| Now, one of the things I thought that they were good at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| they did make it a six-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| which is longer than the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| Maybe it's better to even make it longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| where he can outlast anybody that he might be falling into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| that might try to pull something over him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| You know, I think if you can get the right person in the right position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| I think you can really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| But he would also need to have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| We may even need to change some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| how we can get all these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| And if we're not doing things as well with our computers...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| You know, not every person who's the head of an office or department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| is a computer expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| And not everyone is an efficiency expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| And we can be sort of like the consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| that you sometimes bring to your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| And if we can see that we can get our money back that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| it would probably be worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| But I do have the concern that a lot of my fellow commissioners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| is that this is an expensive office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| but I would want to be certain that our cost effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| is there that we can get that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| And I like the idea of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| but just if you can make it work, it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| And I don't know if we can really keep that completely apolitical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| Enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| That's my opinion, and there'll be people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| that give us some very good examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| Enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| Okay, we've lost a lot of our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| We've been here for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| So we're just trying to keep it to at least 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| I want to thank the Noxjar petitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| I've known them for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| I know that we'll have plenty more time, hopefully, for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| But tomorrow night at the New Harvest Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6455)|
| 1:47:43| 7 o'clock at the New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6463)|

| 1:48:03| across from the Powell United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| I'm in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| We're going to have ours April 7th at West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6490)|

| 1:48:18| It's April 7th at West High School, 6.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6498)|

| 1:48:28| we thank you for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| Hopefully we can all come together at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| and make your government what you want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080318forum?start=6514)|
