| 2:38:57| and in a much earth-friendly method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| So anyway, I just wanted to kind of take a little bit bigger picture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| the context of what's going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| and I think this is going to be a very good use for that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| and I don't see any negative impact to the neighborhoods on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9555)|
| 2:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9558)|
| 2:39:19| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| 12P is an ordinance to change the base zoning classification for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| property located at 5900 and 5902 Kingston Pike from CG3 district to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9569)|
| 2:39:35| CG1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9575)|
| 2:39:36| Taylor DeForester, applicant, seconds district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| Motion made to approve and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9583)|
| 2:39:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| Staff, reading the report, staff denied this because the dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| standards and the lack of design standards are incompatible with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| adopted land use plans and surrounding infrastructure and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| That brought a smile to my face, and the reason is because staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| talking about design standards in CG1, and I'm thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9606)|
| 2:40:12| So this may be the last time I have to ask somebody these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9612)|
| 2:40:15| but Mr. Forester, can you tell us a little bit about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| and then specifically, can you talk to me about which way the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9619)|
| 2:40:22| will face?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| Taylor Forester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| The face of the building will front Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9627)|
| 2:40:33| Do you have any other design specifications you can talk to us about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| That's certainly very important, so I appreciate you mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| No design specifications at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| For full transparency, the majority of council members were here when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9643)|
| 2:40:48| the special use for the Taco Bell on Kingston and Bearden came before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| city council on an appeal located at a different property in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9654)|
| 2:40:59| and there was a lot of discussion about fast food drive-thru on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| north side of Kingston where that was located near Bearden Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| Council did not feel that that was an appropriate location, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| discussion from council and the opposition was that the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| where there were existing fast food drive-thrus was a much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9676)|
| 2:41:19| appropriate location, so property has been identified, and that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| basis for the requested rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| Again, that will require a special use review and approval by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| We expect that the design guidelines will be in place by that submittal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| and that review and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| Again, building will front Kingston, which is already kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| contemplated by the Bearden Village plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9712)|
| 2:41:53| Just reiterating that the biggest problem with not even having minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| design standards in CG1 was that you can have rear-facing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| and we have a few of those examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| The problem you see is that once those go up, they're there for 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| or more, and that doesn't align with, I think, the vision we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| long-term for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| Director Brooks, I've just got a couple minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| Can you talk to us a little bit about the design standards for CG1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| I think it's coming up on a planning commission meeting that's coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| Yes, Amy Brooks, Knox-North County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| That is correct, Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| The planning commission will consider design standards in CG1 on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9749)|
| 2:42:34| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| I'm very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9756)|
