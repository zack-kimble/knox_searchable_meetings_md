| 2:26:57| Madeline Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| What we're doing is getting basically abandoned or rundown property back into healthy neighborhood usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8818)|
| 2:27:06| Is that what we're doing in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8829)|

| 2:27:15| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8835)|
| 2:27:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8838)|
| 2:27:19| 11Q is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation if necessary of a fee simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| interest in certain property located at 808 North 4th Avenue, believed to be owned by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| Birch Maintenance, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Said property to be used for the city's Homemakers Program at a cost not to exceed $45,000 as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| recommended by the Chronic Problem Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8859)|
| 2:27:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8863)|
| 2:27:44| Ms. Rojero, I wanted to ask you a question about the process here, circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| Have we tried to talk to the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8870)|
| 2:27:51| KCDC does this on behalf of the city, does the acquisitions, and they have sent – I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8871)|
| 2:28:01| know with – I don't know whether Birch Maintenance applied to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| I know they sent correspondence to them, to all of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| I'm not sure about Birch Maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| I know what their response was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| They are aware they have been in the – you know, they have – the city has been moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8896)|
| 2:28:22| this forward for some time now through all the different processes that are building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| for the determination of blight, the certification of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| And then I saw today a letter that they had sent on September 15th to Birch Maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8910)|
| 2:28:37| advising them that we were in the process, you know, of purchasing their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8917)|
| 2:28:43| And so I can't tell you what their response was, but they have been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8923)|
| 2:28:48| Okay, so –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| You know, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| But when we pass this authorizing the acquisition, that's one thing where we could just buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8931)|
| 2:28:57| it outright, they would accept the price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| We prefer to buy it outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| We do not want to condemn it and have to go to court and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| Because that's the part I'm – you know, I'm always concerned about is condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8945)|
| 2:29:09| And if it's – the circumstances are right, I understand that's – that ought to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| forward, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| The first goal was to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8955)|
| 2:29:16| That's why we get the fair market appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| We have that to go to the property owner with or KCDC does on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8958)|
| 2:29:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| Our desire is to – and you'll see on one of these other ones we already have a signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| agreement with all the heirs to – it's a willing seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8968)|
| 2:29:34| Here, I'm not sure if they will agree to it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| So it may need to be by condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8978)|
| 2:29:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8982)|
| 2:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| Mr. Mayor, I just want to observe that the Fourth and the Sixth District are blessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8986)|
| 2:29:52| with inner city areas that have young families and others that are trying to restore and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8992)|
| 2:29:59| rebuild and revitalize their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| And if we have properties that have blight, and if you look at the litany in these memos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| on this particular property, we've apparently spent seven years trying to coax, cajole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9007)|
| 2:30:12| notice and violations of code issues with property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| I think it's important that we move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| I think we owe it to the people that live there and want to bring these places back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| to life that if the owners aren't going to do their job, then the city take the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| and put it in the hands of a capable homeowner in that homeowner's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| So I support this and the concept behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9038)|

| 2:31:38| 11-T is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with S&ME for professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| environmental consulting services within the South Waterfront redevelopment area for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| amount not to exceed $382,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9111)|

| 2:31:54| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| Given the amount, I guess I have just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| I'm assuming that what we are doing is work, as this memo reads, in agreement with both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9119)|
| 2:32:07| the city and the EPA to make sure that we don't have contamination issues or whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9127)|
| 2:32:13| as we develop the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| We're not committed to have to spend all that money if we don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| Yeah, if you'd give us your name and title and address that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| Susanna Bass, Program Manager of Sustainability, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| 1816 Paramount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| The EPA's intent for this grant is to basically enable cities to do revitalization, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9149)|
| 2:32:35| not to actually facilitate the revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| So we can take the assessment grant, and they do expect us to spend the whole amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| But that gives us basically background and due diligence so we can purchase property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| So is the purpose then to facilitate the actual development of the waterfront by having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| front-end Phase I or Phase II assessments done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9177)|
| 2:33:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9181)|
| 2:33:02| That's exactly it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| And it's 100 percent federal money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| Not that that's free, because we're all taxpayers on many levels, but that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| It is not matched by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100126?start=9191)|
