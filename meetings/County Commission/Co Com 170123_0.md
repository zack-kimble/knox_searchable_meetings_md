| 0:04:01| the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Yes, sir. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| And you said that you speak English, is that correct? Yes. Good. So, otherwise, I'd have to swear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=246)|

| 0:06:07| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee Beer Laws and Regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=367)|

| 0:06:48| Okay? Health Department? No problem. Fire Marshal? No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=408)|

| 0:07:01| Okay. It's adjacent to those two pieces of property. Sheriff's Department? No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| I'll have one more question then as it relates to your distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Do you hold a liquor by the drink license? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=431)|

| 0:07:19| Thank you, Mr. Law Director. Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| I'm going to make a motion and, you know, Vanessa would have been able to do all this by herself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| but with you being standing there, I'm not sure how I'm going to make this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| I'll make a motion that we accept it as long as they're within the boundaries of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| They're exempt with the liquor by the drink license. Okay. I'll make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| Seeing no further discussion, motion has been made to approve the application, this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=472)|
| 0:08:03| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Opposed, no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| Ms. Fonseca, thank you for being here this afternoon with the best of escorts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| and we wish you good luck in your endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| Now, someone's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| I was going to correct Mr. Thomas on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| One of the accolades that he forgot to mention about FWOD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| was that he was president of the Farragut High School Football Booster Club for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| and did an awesome job for the kids at Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| You're too kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| And had the opportunity to follow him as the vice chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| You did a much better job than I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Now, who's going to make the announcement on the metropolitan drug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| I can't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| FWOD, make sure she talks to Ms. Huddleston right there with her hand in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| She has got some information from the Metropolitan Drug Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| that would prevent her from ever coming back here again, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| Now, for just a second, let me pause us here in between the deferred applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| and then the regular applications that are before us for a couple of note-keeping exercises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| Captain Mays, are you going to give us some guidelines and instructions before the next meeting next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=571)|
| 0:09:41| about how you go about doing what I'll call underage sale to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| Bring your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| I have heard that through the grapevine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| and I wanted to make sure that I got the question out here in front of the people that are here applying today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| The next workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| We will have word from the law enforcement about how stings are conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| and to, I guess, then be working us into the prom season and the end of the school year and things like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| I appreciate what you're doing to get that before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| and I'd also like to recognize the high sheriff standing in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Sheriff Jones is here present with us this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| And I would ask you to come down and say something, but you'd probably treat us like the honorable mayor does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| He'd walk all the way down and say, hi, or do you have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| It's good to have you here with us, J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to add to getting ready for proms and graduation and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| that Metro Drug Coalition is also out here in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| and they'll be working side by side with everyone, too, to make sure everything is ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| Thank you, Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=670)|

| 0:25:50| Senator Mark Norris, he may or may not be running for governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| He's coming to town on Wednesday, and I asked him just to stop off at Ball Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| I thought it would be a good place for people to come in and go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| and say hello to him and let him know your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| As I stated, he hasn't announced that he's running for governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| but there's several that I've done that for that I'm sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| almost every one of them will probably be running for governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| so I have no doubt that he will throw his hat in the ring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| but he hasn't formally announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| If anyone would like to come out from 1130 to 1, 3400 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| Which Ball Market is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Only one Ball Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Continuing with public forum, I have listed John and Melissa Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| the subject being the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Do you wish to speak now or at the speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1605)|

| 0:27:01| Thank you. I'm Melissa Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| This is my husband, John Powell, and we reside at 1104 Tarwater Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| in Knoxville, Tennessee, zip code 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| We just wanted to speak a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| We had some concerns regarding River Sports that handles the kayaking at the cove facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| I'm pretty sure that they also do out at the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| They rent out kayaks there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| My experience was out at the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| They rent kayaks out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Me and my friend had went out there and taken our kids out there on one previous weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| with our children, and we rented some paddle boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and then we also brought some floatables to go into the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and they allowed us to take the floatables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| and we also rented the paddle boards for the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| We went there on a following weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| and we were told that you could no longer bring floats into the area anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| that you had to actually rent their kayaks or their paddle boards to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| and we were kind of questioning why there was a change of policy regarding that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| and the employees were just very rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Our children were very upset because we had to leave and take everything with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| and the employees were just very disregarded to the way the kids were feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| and the way we were feeling and why we were questioning and asking them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| So we weren't really pleased with the behavior of the employees in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| and I know that there's coming up where I guess they were looking at other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| besides river sports to provide the kayaks and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| And then my husband had an experience at the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Yeah, well, we went down there, and I had to go in the back and get the kayaks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| I guess they were understaffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| and I had to get all the kids fitted with the life jackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| I had to drag out all the kayaks from the back, bring them out front, get the paddles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| It took us about 45 minutes before we ever hit the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| I don't know what. He just kept saying I was understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| We just wanted to bring it to your guys' attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| because we feel like maybe someone better suited should come in and handle that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| if there's anyone else in the area that could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=1764)|

| 0:39:23| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| My husband and I adopted Lucas about a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| When we first got Lucas, he couldn't talk, he couldn't walk, he couldn't crawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| and he could only sit up for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| He had major developmental delays, so we enrolled in TEIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| He qualified because of his developmental delays, and we were placed with Nancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| our developmental specialist who works out of the Michael Dunn and Henry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| In just a little over a year, Nancy has been coming into my home for one hour once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| Lucas now is walking, he's talking, he's thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| We recently started preschool, and he is just doing great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| and because all of the teachers at preschool and Nancy and other educational professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| believe that he's not going to need any services when he gets to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| He will not qualify for ChildFind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| This program is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| As a mom that has a child that has a developmental disability, you're overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| You're not prepared to meet your child's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| The beauty of this program is that someone comes into your home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| and they help you meet your child's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| She was working with me just as much as she was working with Lucas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| She equipped me with her wealth of knowledge and experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| I can't say enough about the program and Nancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| but I think they serve a lot of families, and it's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you for your love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2465)|
| 0:41:17| Continuing with public forum, William Isom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2477)|
| 0:41:26| Your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| My name is William Isom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| I'm at 4600 Skyline Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| Big up to ACES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| I think that they're doing much more important work than what I'm getting ready to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| So we've sent all the commissioners, have the county attorney has, Mayor Burchett has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2505)|
| 0:41:54| a copy of a proposed resolution in regards to local determination of broadband access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| You guys all have that in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| And so one of the things I want to encourage you guys to do is to place that resolution on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| I know Commissioner Gill and Carringer have spoke about this several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| and I would, as a resident of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| I'd appreciate that resolution being placed on the agenda for consideration by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| There's quite a number of Knox County residents working quietly for now on trying to close the digital divide in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2547)|
| 0:42:37| eastern Tennessee and central Appalachia as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Knoxville's position in the region, as some people would argue Bristol is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| but I would argue that Knox County is the capital of central Appalachian region economically, commercially, industrially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2564)|
| 0:42:53| You have an obligation to listen to your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And some some people may be encouraged to wait on the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| But I would encourage my commissioners and my county mayor to act proactively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| and allow us to begin to address locally our digital divide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Small mom and pop telecommunications companies such as Duffield, Virginia, Sunset Digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| large big box companies such as AT&T, Comcast, as well as telephone cooperatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2602)|
| 0:43:32| and upcoming legislation around municipal electric cooperatives being able to provide broadband access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| I think all of these things taken together will help us be able to close our digital divide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| And particularly in Knox County, there's some areas that have access issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| such as Corrington, Mascot, Arminda, places like that, even in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| But one of the things that we know after talking with dozens and dozens of residents is that it's affordability and accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2638)|
| 0:44:09| particularly for our low income residents, is something that we're looking to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| And this resolution is just to illustrate that there is local political will to help address the digital divide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| residents are trying to work through themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Also, you know, very few people in Knox County are happy with their broadband service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| Sometimes it's not even broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| So I would just like to encourage you guys to do that, and I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Moving to honorary resolutions, resolution 17-1-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2688)|

| 0:45:14| The next honorary resolution in hand will be held for a few more moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Turning the page, the devotion this evening will be given by Commissioner Hugh Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2719)|
| 0:45:32| Everyone, please bow your heads and join me in a prayer as we begin our deliberations tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| Father Lord, thank you so much for the opportunity to come together as a body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| to civilly discuss matters of importance in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| As I was thinking today before making this prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| I thought there are so many folks around this world who suffer in oppressive governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| who suffer in poverty, who would be grateful for the problems that we have that we debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| And please never let us lose that perspective that we are the best nation on earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| and one of the best places in the absolute world to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| And may we continue to be grateful that we have these problems and challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| and discussions that we get to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Please guide us with discernment as we do our best to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| that are in the best interest of our whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Please give us wisdom and please help us all, to all of us, our commission, our visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2789)|
| 0:46:37| all of our guests, to remember how important it is to exude civility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| as we come together in wonderful discussion to help move our county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| So once again, we're grateful to be here, and in your name we pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2813)|

| 0:47:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2822)|

| 0:47:13| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2833)|
| 0:47:24| Thank you, Commissioner Nystrom. Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=2844)|

| 1:03:17| She snuck over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| But I'd just like to say all the freedom-loving people in this country and in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| we stand on the shoulders of folks like Yvonne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I go into classrooms all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| I talk to the kids, and they tell me how tough things are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| and I try to explain to them how tough things used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| And it's just hard to explain to young folks today how far we've come in this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| and definitely how far we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| But I guess at this moment I'm really reminded of something that Alex Haley said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3823)|

| 1:03:55| There was a little map, but on the top of it it said find the good and praise it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| and that's exactly what we're doing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| And I also have a proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| It reads almost identical, so I'll just present it to her and the family, and we'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| I just simply want to say behind every great man, obviously, is a great woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| And I want to extend sympathy and condolences to the family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| and make sure I say a long-time civil rights advocate, a long-time pioneer in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| Avon Rollins was truly a humanitarian, and better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| He was a friend, a family man, and a God-fearing servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3883)|
| 1:04:51| Ms. Rollins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| On behalf of our family, I want to thank Mayor Burchett, Representative Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3893)|
| 1:05:03| and all of you commissioners for honoring Avon today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| Avon would have loved to have been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| and I know he would have missed not getting this picture taken with Mayor Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| and enjoying this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Avon loved Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| He loved Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| And our family intends to continue to live and to be committed to nonviolence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| and helping our young people get off these streets and stop shooting one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| Again, I want to thank you very much for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| We do appreciate it, and my husband was truly, truly, truly deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3957)|
| 1:06:14| Mayor Burchett, I'm placing you in charge of delivering the amended resolution when printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3974)|
| 1:06:32| I think that takes us to the item, the order of business, to the item, which is 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| This is on page 9, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| approving a lease agreement with River Sports Outfitters, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| for the operation of outfitter services at the Cove at Concord Park, Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4008)|
| 1:06:59| Now then, I had signed up for public forum to speak when the item was brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| This is item 701, and that's Mr. Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| Mr. Hill, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| I'm Kevin Hill of 509 Cambridge Street in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| As a bidding party for the RFP 2447, and as advised, I'm claiming whistleblower status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| I'm requesting this commission investigate the possibility of an unfair bidding process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| for the outfitter services at the Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| The RFP stated, county will provide typical repairs to the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| Further, it states, contractor shall provide daily maintenance to the lease space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Any changes or alterations to the structure shall be the financial responsibility of the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| Therefore, I budgeted expenses for daily maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| and particularly pertinent to this matter, building improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| It now seems the winning vendor knew from past experience these contractually obligated costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| would not truly be necessary to factor into its expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| The privileged information allowed the winner to inflate its revenue share with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| This is further evident by the fact that while having no interactions with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| the other competing bidders have very similar revenue shares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| therefore accounting for these ongoing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| After submitting my bid, county maintenance personnel informed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| that several maintenance issues and building improvements had been done by them on behalf of RiverSports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| This work was done despite the contractual obligation of RiverSports to perform and pay for these services itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| This is relevant because it is precisely this ongoing history that enabled RiverSports to present a higher figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| knowing it could pass responsibilities on to the county as it had regularly done in the past as alleged by this employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| The work in question was regular HVAC repairs, installation of multiple security fixtures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| repairs to the doors, resurfacing floors, interior painting, and ongoing maintenance of the bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| The employee stated whenever RiverSports wanted something done, they simply had to call and request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| The relevant section of the previous contract states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| RiverSports shall, at its expense, keep and maintain the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| including but not limited to the building at the cove at Concord Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| improvements, fixtures, trade fixtures, equipment, and utility systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| Further it states, should RiverSports fail, after 30 days notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| county may enter upon the premise and perform RiverSports obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| RiverSports shall reimburse county for costs incurred by county under this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| County shall not have any duty to make, nor shall it be called upon to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| any improvements, replacements, or repairs whatsoever to the premises or any structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| This contract is clear that the county should not have incurred costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| or acted as the general contractor for the maintenance or improvements of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Furthermore, the county should only have done work on the property as a result of delinquency by RiverSports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| It's even a violation of the contract for RiverSports to request work by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| Yet, a county employee has openly alleged that upon RiverSports request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| county employees, equipment, and funds were used in the building maintenance and improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| Despite the fact that the new RFP stipulated that the county would be responsible for certain maintenance issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| in contrast to the past contract, the RFP still required vendors perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| and performance and payment for improvements to the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| The other vendors bid without the knowledge that the county had made a 10-year practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| of being a general contractor for the previous tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| It was, if these services were rendered without reimbursement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| then not only is there an issue of full disclosure in the bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| but also a concern for possible misappropriation of county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| After 10 years of operating under these circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| RiverSports seemed to hold unique knowledge that the county made it a regular practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| to ignore strict terms of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| This fact constitutes an unfair advantage in the bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| enabling RiverSports to offer a higher compensation to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| If one argues the new RFP was clear on the burden of responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| then that argument seems meaningless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Imagine what we have here is a 10-year contract with the same clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| allegedly regularly violated by the same agency and the same contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| And now these same parties are about to engage in a 20-year contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4316)|
| 1:12:03| and it's the same entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Why should we expect different results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| Because of these facts, I recommend the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| First, the contract in question should be tabled until commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| has made its investigation of these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Second, if the commission believes the taxpayers may have been defrauded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| then action should be taken to rectify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| Third, if the former, what I just said, is the position of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| then the current winning bid should be summarily rejected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| and the contract awarded to the next highest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Finally, if reimbursement did occur, because I have no knowledge if it didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| then the winning bidder still had privileged information based on my argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| and so the contract should be rebid in order to guarantee a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| Yeah, I guess really the questions are for Matt and Matt Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| and I guess if we want to talk about the process, and Doug Battelle, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| You're going to lead that with a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| I'll make a motion to approve just so we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Matt, I guess this is the first I've heard of the discussion about previous work on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4398)|
| 1:13:28| Did the previous contract say that the county would maintain the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| and can you talk about the scope of the work that's been done on the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| Commissioner Anders, I'd have to defer to Doug Battelle on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| I did not bring the contract except for the new one right here that's with us in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4421)|
| 1:13:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| One issue with this building, and we discussed this early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| and, again, I understand the original contract was 15 years old now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| One issue with this building is that it is a shared use building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| The bigger chunk of utilities and repairs go into the restrooms in this building, which are public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| So repairing of HVAC systems, absolutely we did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| but, again, mainly because the lion's share of that utility goes to these restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| The river sports operation is very seasonal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| It's probably open maybe 120 days a year, daylight hours only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| These restrooms are open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day for the general public to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| We have over 80,000 visitors at the Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| So, again, absolutely we do repairs in that building, too, because it is a shared use facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| The primary thing river sports did in that building was store boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| The boats come out during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| They go back in at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| So repairs in terms of the inside of that building were absolutely minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| Could our staff have assisted on some of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Perhaps, yes, but, again, it would have been very minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| because it's essentially used as a storage building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| Any of the equipment or inventory that's in that building belongs to river sports throughout the term of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| So, yeah, shared building, a little unique in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| Some of the boilerplate language in the contract probably needs to revise to reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| The one item I would probably disagree with Mr. Hill on specifically is the new bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| which is really what we're discussing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| In the new bid, we recognize the fact that under a five-year term contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| you're not going to get a contractor to do improvements on a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Any businessman would not put a large chunk of money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| That's why we did a longer term contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| We act specifically through that process to tell us how much you're going to spend and how you're going to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| And even in the new contract language we have, we have much different language there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| which we'll continue to refine if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| a process where the county approves plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| If the contractors not have the plans done in a certain amount of time, we can terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| If they don't start construction in a certain amount of time, we can terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| If they don't complete construction in a certain amount of time, we can terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| And that's because we did want to see that building improved, but under the old agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| obviously in a leasehold type situation, you're not going to expect a lot of money to come back through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| But, again, shared use building, it is a little unique in its nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| My next question will be for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| In regards to the contract, once a contract comes before us, and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4581)|
| 1:16:31| there's an appeal to the bid, anybody that doesn't win that can appeal to the finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Yes, they have an appeal process and they have an actual time to appeal within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| and then you're statute limited out and there is no appeal beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| If you have that appeal and you succeed with that appeal or fail with that appeal, you can take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| What would be the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Well, it would probably be if they were not satisfied with the administrative appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| then you go through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| But generally speaking, if you fail to go through the administrative remedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| you probably will not be successful appealing beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| Because of the question, Mr. Hill wanted us to investigate his commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| We don't have the ability to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| I mean, we can look into, but the legal would come back to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| Wouldn't that overstep the procurement guidelines that the state has set forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4647)|
| 1:17:38| Well, you have two different issues before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| One is a past contract, which is a contract management issue, which is an administrative issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| And then we have ways to report and to account any issues related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| Then you have the bid process on a new contract with a new set of facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| and you have a procedure that you go through for that and you have an appeal procedure for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| So two different things you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Whatever the county decides to do on an existing contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| even in a breach is an administrative decision that the mayor will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| and that department will make as to what extent they feel that something has been breached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| before it ever comes to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| And they can acquiesce to certain things under the fact patterns that they see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| make administrative judgments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| That's what they're for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| As far as what's before the commission tonight, you have a process that went through a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| You have an administrative procedure that was not taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| And that's what you have before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Mr. Hill, is that right? Did I get the name right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| Did you appeal with the director of finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| I concede that I did not make that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Part of this is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| There were some circumstances in the bid process that came to light that just quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| because they didn't come to light until conversations and made it clear past that appeal date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| that caused me to question the legitimacy of the winning bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Because we've got to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| We're speaking in broad terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| Yes, I'll answer your question in a second, but I want to give clarity why I didn't address that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4776)|
| 1:19:45| It's often like a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| You pull one thread and other things start unraveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| What it was explained to me is that for you all to not move forward in this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| you all have to either see a problem with the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| or you have to have a material problem with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| And it's not just the shared bathroom in the HVAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| There's installation of security bars inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| That's a commercial fixture that was done by county employees in violation of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| So my argument is we had someone who knew that he had a history of relying upon the county to provide services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| That's expenses that you know you can pass off to another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| That affects your ability to compensate the county in your bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| And so I chose to go with that because that speaks to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| Because the process has been corrupted if there's evidence that there's privileged information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4840)|
| 1:20:49| I would argue that that pattern of ten years of operations constitutes privileged information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| If you want me to speak to the original issue, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| Well, I mean, I think it's important that everything's on the table, the facts are on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| And the reason why I didn't bring it up is fairly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| It was a matter of whether I found out about it after the fact or not, the three-day window had closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| And so I felt like this was a more cogent issue that was relevant because it had my claim of privileged information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| But to answer your question, there was information inserted into the bid that in talking with persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4887)|
| 1:21:37| and they haven't decided to come forward so I don't feel comfortable stating that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| that was questionable as to whether it was accurately presented and whether it was truthful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| What information? Because it's going to be important. What information is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| An employee that was listed in the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| An employee was listed in the bid of the winning bidder who did not know that they were inserted into the bid as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4915)|
| 1:22:03| As an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Yeah, of RiverSports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| RiverSports had someone in their bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| They did not know that they had been insinuated into that bid as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4928)|
| 1:22:18| I don't know. I'm not following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| So his name was inserted into the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Yes, along with his resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| He wasn't aware or an employee of RiverSports is what he's saying, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| He was not an employee of RiverSports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| He was not an employee of RiverSports and did not know that he had been included as an employee in the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| Was that required to put in the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Yes. He was listed under the tab that was listing for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| Of the Cove area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Well, not of the Cove area, but of RiverSports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Just to be brief, I wanted to disclose a non-financial conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| I'm on the Board of Directors for one of the subcontractors that Mr. Hill used on his bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| I'm on the Board of Directors for the Mews Children's Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| They are providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Okay. I'm on the Board of Directors for the Mews Children's Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| They do a great, incredible job with children's programming, just to put a plug in for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| and they were part of the bid that he put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| so I just wanted to get that out on the table as discussions ensues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| I didn't want anybody to think that I was hiding the fact that I'm on the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| I have no financial interest at all, but in the spirit of consistent transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| I did want to disclose that I'm on the Board of Directors on part of the team for the subcontractor that was part of this bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Mr. Hill, one question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| I'm still a little foggy on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Why do you think this person's name was included, but he was not an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| Because I've spoken with the person after the fact, and they said they had no knowledge of their inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| I understand that, but why are you thinking his name would have been on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| What purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Are you saying that he had a connection to get the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| You'd have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I would assume so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Everyone I included in my bid, it goes beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| It's actually someone who wrote a letter of recommendation for my bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| Someone who wrote a letter of recommendation for my bid was inserted into my competitor's bid by my competitor as an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5065)|
| 1:24:34| So that's why I knew, wait a second, something's not right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| But the dots didn't get connected, because when I first found out about this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| I requested the winning bid from procurement, and there was difficulty delivering it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| And only half the bid came through the email, and I was going to have to come back to the office and pick it up on a jump drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| So I received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| I saw this information, but I only had half the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| So when I spoke to the individual, he said that I was asked if I would give advice if the bid was won, and I said sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5101)|
| 1:25:10| And so I go, okay, he's listed as an advisor, and I kind of let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| And then when I finally got my hands on the jump drive and finally opened it up and saw that no, he's not listed as an advisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| he's listed as an employee, I was like, well, wait a minute, now that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| Are you saying it's just a technicality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| They was accidentally put on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| You're saying it's something that they did fraudulently to get the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| That would have to be the determination of this group, but it looked very concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| Okay, and second question for you, why didn't you file an appeal before the deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| Because I didn't find out about this in the original problem until after the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| Okay, thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| And, Doug, it may be for you, what were the factors in the winning bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| How many factors are considered in the bid process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| If I recall, we had five separate categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| Actually, two had to do with the program, one for the improvements, and then two financial categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| Financial stability or the ability to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| Both financial stability as well as the revenue to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| And those are scored just on a mathematical process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| If you all recall, Perry came down last week and explained that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| and I think he's still here that he could explain that again if we need him to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| And, Mr. Law Director, quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| It appears to me we have two things going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| One, we have a process that's already been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| The appeal process has passed, and I don't know how we go back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| And the second thing is, if he's saying there's been some collusion or fraud or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| it needs to go to the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5207)|
| 1:26:54| There's two issues going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| A past contract, which is not relevant to this contract in terms of its material statements and behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| The second part is that we have an administrative procedure that we can't go back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| No matter for what reason you appeal or you don't appeal, you either do or you don't in the deadline times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| And we call that, under the law, statute of limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Have passed. It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| The other issue that was brought about, which may or may not be an issue itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| was the employee issue a material fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5244)|
| 1:27:32| And I use the term, is this a key man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| Is this something that is relevant in what the county would use to determine the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| Is it significant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Or, as sometimes we call, is it a Scribner error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| Put him in the wrong column. It should have been this column or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| I don't know. That's just what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| So those questions, in terms of what were the decision-making powers and how relevant was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| would be with the people who evaluated the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| Kevin is in my district, and Kevin came to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| and I am a commissioner for all of Norris County, especially for the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| Kevin was getting hard time to getting some information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| and all the commissioners has got a lot of the information that I have requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| and I thank Parks and Rec for getting that information to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| I have a couple of phone calls from employees or ex-employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| that feel that they would be retaliated against if they came and spoke like the couple there in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5324)|
| 1:28:53| I've had the e-mail of the shows of the garbage and some of the evidence that we see down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| and some of the things that I really think that River Sports, you know, the doors, the gutters, the things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| some of that stuff should have been reimbursed to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| That might be through the audit committee to go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| I want to request everything that's there and be paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| I've spoken with Mr. Hill and told Mr. Hill that I had spoken a long time with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5358)|
| 1:29:25| about the key man, about the process and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| Mr. Law Director had informed me that before me tonight is this contract and this contract only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| and Mr. Hill knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| If I have to vote today on this contract and this contract only, I will have to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5380)|
| 1:29:49| Well, do I agree with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Probably not because I think there's a lot of questions that still needs to be answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| from the past five years, ten years, no audits, no records, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| It's kind of, and it's just like Mr. Hill said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| are we going to do business the next 20 years as we did business the last 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| I think the motion may have to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| The law director can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| Mr. Patel has said in 9.02 that a schedule of review by internal audit will be included in a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5421)|
| 1:30:30| I think we need to make sure that if this contract is passed that that is added to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| Currently it's not in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| That needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| That being said, if it smells, it smells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| That's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| But as the way it is, and I've talked to two individuals in the e-mail that all commissioners got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| everything, every e-mail that I've gotten is passed on to Joe Lee and all the commissioners has received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| Do I like it the way it's been for the last 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| But I'm informed that I must vote on this contract and the legitimacy of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5467)|
| 1:31:15| So am I happy, once again, of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| But is it to the extent that we're a little too late?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| It might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| And I appreciate this couple for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| I actually appreciate Mr. Hill for contacting me so I could help him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| Because I'm not only his commissioner, I'm the commissioner for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| And this is taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| You know, that's the important part about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| I don't care if it's A company or Z company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| This is taxpayer money that we must watch over as the 11 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| I just want to get about two, well, three things clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5517)|
| 1:32:06| The Avers we have before us, number one, is brought to us by vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| By that I mean it's brought, what we're doing right now, we either vote it up or down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Make it a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| You want to invoke the motion up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| So we can vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| So we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| Is it legal as it is presented to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| It is legal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| Well, the process that they went through, there's been no proof presented that the process was not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| And you have the people here to ask the questions about the process, which it seems to be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| And the only issue before, there was a failure to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| And now they've brought all these appeals to this body, which is not an appellate body, to make a political decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5570)|
| 1:33:00| And all I'm dealing with is the legal decision that we went through a bid process, the bid was awarded, there's an appeal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| there was no appeal, and the contract under the bid is before this body to vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| That's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| So the facts is either vote up or down, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| As Doug Battelle said, this is one of our premier parks in Knox County with over 80,000 people that come to use it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| We would like to think that the Cove is a destination for people in East Tennessee to come and use the water, the volleyball courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5615)|
| 1:33:44| the playgrounds, and have the birthday parties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| I have a problem with one vendor having use of that property for a quarter century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5628)|
| 1:33:56| They've had it for 15 years, they get it now for another 10 years, and then obviously an option for another 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| I think if the vendor did not uphold the first contract that was in place in 2002, I have a hard time voting to support a contract again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5644)|
| 1:34:16| And what I'm referencing is they were to provide canoes and kayaks, bicycles, and camping equipment at the Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5656)|
| 1:34:24| To my knowledge, they've only provided kayaks and canoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| They've had two renewals on their contract, and I'd like Mr. Battelle to tell me what happened to why they were excused from having the additional items for rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5671)|
| 1:34:43| that would have been generating revenue for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| Yes, sir, there's a couple things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| One is, historically, two included in this contract was Seven Islands, which the county no longer owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| The camping specifically was for Seven Islands because we had camping there as a part of that contract, but obviously that has went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5698)|
| 1:35:07| So that was one of the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Obviously, we do not have camping at the Cove, so we wouldn't have any reason to provide tents and camping apparel there, or for rentals, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5708)|
| 1:35:17| But at Seven Islands, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| We had camping spaces there, and quite frankly, we tried that for several years, and it was not really in much demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5718)|
| 1:35:25| I don't think the state has offered that either, as they've taken that over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| So that is one of the reasons there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| Honestly, too, when we look at renewals, the first couple times, canoeing and kayaking was not extremely popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5730)|
| 1:35:38| When you look back over the revenue beginning of this contract, there was not a lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| Honestly, until the last five years, when paddleboarding has come into fashion, is when this has really taken off, and we've seen good revenues down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5742)|
| 1:35:50| Again, one of the reasons we looked at a different contract fashion here to try to get more revenue to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| but also make the improvements and make those improvements a requirement of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| Again, my discussions with their internal audit, and again, typically with these kind of contracts, we would only do an audit if there was complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| I do have to say, was River Sport perfect in executing this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| But on the other hand, we got very few complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| I think since this is the mayor's administration, we've had zero complaints come through the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| So the general service that we're providing to the public seemed to be pretty good because of that lack of any public complaints coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5779)|
| 1:36:28| But in talking with internal audit, they also said the language in the contract needs to be cleaned up, too, that an audit can mean a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| It'll really probably be a contract review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| We're asking them to set that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Obviously, they've got limited staff, too, of how much of this they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| So we're going to ask them whatever schedule they see is reasonable, say in a five- or ten-year period, for them to come in and do a contract review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| and make sure that things are being done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| Okay, and then the bicycle situation, someone determined we're not going to do that at the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| Actually, I believe we have had some bicycle rentals down there over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| But again, in any business, if you bring bicycles in and there's no demand for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| obviously they're just sitting there not getting rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| There's no reason to continue that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| And again, I think as we go forward, there will be a much greater demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| We just finished a greenway connection from the cove down to some new trails at the roundabout property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| So we very much see that being a viable part of the operation then as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| Okay, and then back to the maintenance issue, I share some of the same concerns Commissioner Daley had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| River Sports was to request from you that they needed repairs done, and you were to approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| and then they were to pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| In the last 15 years of that contract, how many times did they submit a request to have repairs done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| that you would have to sign off and then in turn they would end up have completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| Probably the biggest repair item I can recall is the flooring in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| They actually came in and installed an entire wood floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| After so many years, it was wore out, realized it was not an effective thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| That was all ripped out and the floor was just painted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| So, yeah, but minimal repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| And again, it's a small space essentially used for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| I mean, if you went and looked at it, it's a pretty bland space, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| primarily because it is used for storage of boats, canoes, and kayaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| And again, that's within the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| So we wanted to look at new storage outside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| Let's renovate the building and make it something nicer for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| Okay, and then you did have the option through the old contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| to have internal audit with Knox County look at their books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| And I'm assuming you made a decision not to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| that you were happy with the checks that they were sending you as their 5% of gross sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| Yeah, and again, I think if you look at the revenue right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| if the county was running the business down there and generating the revenue they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| and making the same percentage, we'd be pretty happy with in terms of this kind of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| You know, you don't expect to get rich off a small operation running canoes and kayaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| for a few months of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| So relative to other recreation establishments, I think it's fairly standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| And again, you know, historically we've not done audits on these groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| unless there is a reason to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| because there's not been a standard schedule set up with internal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| where we ever had a request to say, you know, this needs to be audited on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Okay, and then for the citizens who are using the facilities that have a complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| and if they come up to one of your personnel from Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| they're now instructed that they need to call the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| Is that what you're saying, when there's a complaint at that facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Sure, we get calls to our office, and I know the mayor's office gets numerous calls, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| in any county operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Okay, but your staff will now be in the process of telling that a citizen that has a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| they need to call the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| I'm just trying to clarify what you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Well, now, my staff would instruct folks to call our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| Okay, is there any record kept then from complaints of services at the Cove for the past 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| You know, if there was something specific, we would probably have a record of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Again, in 15 years, I can't remember of a real strong complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| I'm sure there was a complaint, but honestly, nothing stands out that we had to take some severe action on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| As we continue with this discussion, I would admonish the commission, as directed by the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| that we control our discussion to the contract that's on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| and if there needs to be something done about past practice, we'll handle that, some other procedure or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6046)|
| 1:40:55| What we have before us is a contract on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| Well, and these are probably something we can have the discussion later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| but I was really concerned about the pictures of trash, whose responsibility that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| so it doesn't have to do so much contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| But I will say I was also concerned about the parents that came down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| saying that they could no longer bring their floats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| Is it stated? I didn't see anywhere in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| Is it stated somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| That was a different location. That's at Iams. That's not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| Commissioner, let me say, too, a separate operation, Iams, has a separate contract with River Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| that meets quarry, and those policies are determined by Iams Nature Center, not River Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| Well, how is it down at the Cove? Is it anybody can bring or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| You don't enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| Okay, so those were big concerns here with the trash and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| We can discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Commissioner Anders, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Well, I'm just going to make a, I think the gentleman there wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| I don't know who it is, and I was also going to make an amendment to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| Do you wish to recognize the man at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Yes, I mean, he's been standing for ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Thank you. I'm Ed McAllister, owner of River Sports Outfitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| I would just like to say I've been a citizen of this community since 1961.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| I've been totally transparent in any and all of my business practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| I must say I have never, ever been accused of some of the things that I'm hearing tonight from behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6157)|
| 1:42:45| I will answer any and all questions you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| There is nothing to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| This was a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| My bid was several times higher in the percent to the county than the competing bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| I offered to spend in excess of $100,000 immediately, which we're working on to improve the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6178)|
| 1:43:06| My heart is in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| That is my passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| When it comes to IMES, it's the same situation on the boat that you mentioned that was set by their board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6191)|
| 1:43:18| to control and prevent drownings to have one outfitter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| I was given that award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| I also have contracts with many state organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| I've never had one thing questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| So I just want to get that straight for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| And if you have questions, please ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| Continuing, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Yeah, I made the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| I'd like to amend that to a motion to approve with two caveats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| I guess both people, I guess the contractor has to agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| but to have the access to internal audit to come down and check the books in the business or internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| And also I'd like for Parks and Rec to hang a sign with the phone number for constituent services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| That takes the conflict out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| So if it goes to constituent services in the mayor's office, there's no question of if we've cooled over anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| I think if we can do that, I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| So I'll keep my motion to approve with just a sign added in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| The second approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| Commissioner Gill was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| Do you agree with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| And I just had a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| I guess my question will be for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| We're going to add this one caveat here to do the internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| Commissioner Daley, the internal audit is already in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| Just let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| If we're changing any, if Doug is going to change anything about this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| don't we need to know about this contract if there's any changes before we vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| If we don't, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| If we do, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| If there's any change to the contract that is material, then you can do that within the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| Everybody knows about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| And you can vote it up or down with the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| If you vote it down with the change, then you come back to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| and you vote on that motion up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| That's just the procedure of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| I think right now the commissioner is talking about an audit of a past contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| because there's nothing to audit under this new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| There's nothing there to audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| Now, from Mr. Battelle, you have in front of you, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| note, a schedule of review by internal audit will be included in the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| That's not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| Is that included in this contract that we are voting on, yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| Again, I would assume that's a detail we could adjust because I've asked internal audit just to give us that language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| which, again, what they said would be a contract review and just the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| I don't know what they're going to recommend on the schedule once every five years or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| And, again, it's a staffing issue for them, too, of what they feel like they can schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| But as soon as we get that response back, we can include that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| And that can be included in this by motion and the commission's on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| And I think that's what Commissioner Andrews just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| Is that material to the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| It's not material to the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| It's just including it in the contract that he'd be open for a county audit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| If you make that in your motion, then it becomes incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| That was my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| I thought it was already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| Commissioner Daly, are you satisfied at the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| I believe Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| And they offered the clarification to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| So I just have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| The question before the body for commission tonight is to approve the existing contract with the two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| This is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| So vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| Down would mean you reopen the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| I'm trying to figure out this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| This is a clarification for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| You have an amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| You vote on whether you pass the amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| If you do, then it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| If you don't, then it falls back to the original resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| If you vote that resolution up or down, if you vote it down, then it has to go back to purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6448)|
| 1:47:35| The game starts all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| It doesn't go to the second bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| It's a new ball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| I wanted to check this and clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| The contract does call for audits, and I think what Doug was talking about was defining what the term audit means, what type of audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6474)|
| 1:48:04| Secondly, do we really have to amend this contract to put a sign on our own property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| No, I just wanted that to be a caveat to eliminate that perceived conflict of interest from the Recreation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6490)|
| 1:48:22| Seeing no further discussion, the motion that is properly before us is to approve this contract with the caveat that the complaint number be 215-HELP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6502)|
| 1:48:39| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Which is the direct line into the mayor's office to enter the complaint into the big computer in the sky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6521)|
| 1:48:49| which will then turn around and be farmed out to anyone way off course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6529)|
| 1:48:55| Is that the only addition to the contract that's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| That is in the original motion made by the original maker and agreed to by the second, so that if we approve this, we're finished with this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6539)|
| 1:49:15| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| I hear one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6574)|

| 1:50:09| Madam Clerk, that concludes all of our business, correct, with the exception of the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6609)|
| 1:50:19| The first discussion item that I brought up was the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| I believe that to be Commissioners Anders, Bussler, Carringer and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| I had asked Commissioner Bussler to hack his e-mail and send out a meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6633)|
| 1:50:44| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| It's still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| Superintendent Thomas has sent an e-mail out to us asking for a date in the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| The dates that are offered are February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| Get your calendar out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| Get your calendar out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Don't post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| While we're doing that, while you're getting your calendar out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| I'd like to recognize that plain old Bob Thomas has sat through the entire session and he's not worn his chewing gum out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6669)|
| 1:51:21| The Board of Education had its mid-month work session this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| That's the reason he's here by himself representing the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| Thank you, plain old Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| He's UT Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| UT Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| UT Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| I'm the plain old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| No, you're the at-large Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| He's taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| He's the plain old Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Everyone have your calendar out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| The superintendent has offered up a couple of dates in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| Is it February the 8th or February the 9th at 430?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6717)|
| 1:52:12| The time is the same on both dates, 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Which date appeals to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| Did that go out to everybody or is that for the joint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| Just the joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| That was the joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Put committee on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| We've already sent him back what day we're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| We'll let you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| Yeah, it's February 8th or 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| So the date is the 8th or the 9th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| Yeah, we don't know yet, 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| We just now started corresponding with him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| And he's going to let us know what the board members can do, 8th or 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| Then I'm out of the loop on scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| The other discussion item is on the Knox County audit, which has just been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| Is Mr. Caldwell still present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Commissioner Nystrom are also members of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| Either of you wish to say a word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| I was just very pleased that the external auditor was able to complete our external audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6799)|
| 1:53:26| and file it with the State of Tennessee on time as required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| Some counties don't fall into that same category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| so I'm really thankful for Chris Caldwell and his staff and the external audit team for getting it filed on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6816)|
| 1:53:46| Did you recognize him for 20 years of exemplary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| What was the terminology you used, Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| Oh, my gosh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Twenty years of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| It's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| It's an award that we get for completion of our annual report from GFOA, which is our standards board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6836)|
| 1:54:04| but basically where we meet certain criteria in our annual report each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6844)|
| 1:54:12| Twenty-one years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| And no findings either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| One finding, but it's already been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| We went from three findings a year ago to one this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| and I think three audit adjustments down to one this year, so all improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| And I think in the Board of Education's field, they reduced their findings and reoccurrences both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6871)|
| 1:54:42| Year over year, I think we've had improvement the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6882)|
| 1:54:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Out of the Board of Education's portion of the external audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| Commissioner Nystrom, did you wish to say anything about the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| No specific comment other than it was really pleasing to see the good work that Chris's team is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| and it's just the kind of audit you want to have, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| Hey, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| What year is Pew in of this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6914)|
| 1:55:25| Is it year two of term two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Maybe year one of term one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| Year one of term two that we just finished possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| Terry's saying 2019 is what he thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| A few years back, we changed how many consecutive years you do this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| And one thing it does when you have a firm that keeps coming back, they know more and more where to dig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| So it really is impressive that our audits keep getting cleaner when we have an auditor that knows even more about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| What Commissioner Smith is talking about, he was on charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| It used to be that we had to get a new audit firm every four years, which was crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| Now it's every, after the first four-year term, they can bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| We do put it out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| They can bid again, and other firms can bid, but they can only hold it for a total of eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| That's really still short compared to others, but it was definitely an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| Speaking to that, being a local audit firm, I mentioned this at the audit committee meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6987)|
| 1:56:36| Hugh and company, Mr. Elmore, read something in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=6996)|
| 1:56:42| which was not right here at a commission meeting or not in the books somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7002)|
| 1:56:48| and he immediately took that under his wing, so to speak, and investigated what was reported in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7008)|
| 1:57:00| and found the newspaper to be factual in what was taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| No harm to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| The process was followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Based on a fact that he picked up in the newspaper, which leads me to say it's good to have a local auditing firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7033)|
| 1:57:24| They hear more about what's going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker, were you going to comment further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| I was going to make a funny comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| I just wanted to make an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| We are into announcements now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| Ms. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7065)|

| 2:02:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 13-0 to recommend the designation of the property as a low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7366)|
| 2:02:56| The commission found that the proposed low density residential use would be appropriate along North Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| which is classified as a minor collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| The requested density was also found to be compatible with surrounding zoning and development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7386)|
| 2:03:12| During the meeting, there was one comment from a neighboring property owner who owns property on Newcomb Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| asking that question about the access to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| The developer committed that the access would not be on Newcomb Lane, which is a narrow lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| but would come from North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| With that, that's the end of my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7411)|

| 2:03:48| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to adopt this sector plan amendment as adopted by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7428)|

| 2:04:49| The commission found that the planned residential zoning at the recommended density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| is consistent with the recommended LDR sector plan designation just approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| and the proposal would be compatible with the surrounding development and zoning densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7498)|

| 2:06:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended on their consent agenda 13-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| that the commission approve the proposed planned residential zoning at a density of four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| The commission found that the PR zoning at the requested density is consistent with the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7593)|
| 2:06:40| and would allow uses compatible with the surrounding land uses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| The site is relatively flat and has few environmental constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| so it is suitable for the development at the density proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Question, Mr. Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| On the development on the front end there, are you going to build on the south side of the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| or are you kind of like Connors Creek going to leave that empty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| How are you going to overcome that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| We've got a little bit more room than Connors Creek does there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| so we'll have three lots on either side of the road going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| And then, of course, the 50-foot string buffers is required for Knox County, then kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| But we do have two or three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| Are you going to—and I don't know if Gerald is going to require this or if engineering—do you have egress in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| or is it going to be—are you going to have a turn lane in with some egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| or is it going to be straight off the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| I don't believe we'll have a turn lane in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| We've already had the concept plan approved through MPC, and that was not part of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| We have like 50-something lots there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| I don't think we get threshold for a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7664)|

| 2:09:06| I'll ask them to stand real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| Some of them may, depending on how the questions go, come up and they can introduce themselves at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7749)|
| 2:09:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| Mr. Green, do you have additional testimony to enter into tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| I have no information that was not provided at the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| I'd be happy to answer any questions if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| Do the commissioners have any questions regarding MPC's recommendation or their actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| Mr. Green, can you go over the zoning, the density, how it was stated last time in the commission, how you stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7782)|
| 2:09:51| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended approval of the rezoning request at a density of up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7791)|
| 2:09:59| Is it like one to three or just zero to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| Up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| So that's zero to three, yes, any range within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| They did not set an absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| The zoning would allow any development from no development to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7810)|
| 2:10:19| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| Mr. Green, as to the first two conditions, it seems unusual to me that lot size is determined in a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7822)|
| 2:10:31| and not on a use, review, and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| How did you all come to determining the parameters of those lot sizes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7834)|
| 2:10:43| Through speculation, looking at the adjacent properties and trying to come up with some way to buffer those larger lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7843)|
| 2:10:54| from the smaller lots proposed in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| This was one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| Obviously, there are some other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| The developer has proposed a buffer and conservation area as a means of buffering the development from the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7862)|
| 2:11:11| We are, again, trying to find something that would provide that means of buffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| and transition from the higher density development proposed in this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| to the low density development that exists on the adjacent lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7881)|
| 2:11:29| Seeing no further, Commissioner Besseler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| Mr. Green, I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7893)|
| 2:11:34| How long has the sector plan been in effect out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| This one was adopted last year, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| Last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7902)|
| 2:11:43| At that point in time, you recommended what for future development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| The sector plan designation is LDR, low density residential, which is up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7910)|
| 2:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| The other question I have is in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| When I was on MPC, you always did a, when you went from agricultural to another low density or residential unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7925)|
| 2:12:13| you always started with one to three or one to four or one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| This, what I thought was done last time, you said zero to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7937)|
| 2:12:22| The recommendation was for the rezoning for the planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| At that point, the planning commission can recommend densities within the range established in the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7947)|
| 2:12:37| The sector plan designation provides the planning commission with the option to approve zoning anywhere from one to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7957)|
| 2:12:47| In this case, they selected three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| that would assure greater compatibility with the adjacent properties and the character of development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7971)|
| 2:12:58| The issue I have with it, and I'm not, is I think you said zero to three last time was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7978)|
| 2:13:09| The gentleman that owns the property right now under agricultural has, you know, one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| He could do one acre on agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=7999)|
| 2:13:20| But if we go to zero and we set kind of a standard here by saying zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8000)|
| 2:13:26| then people that are coming here, we have a way of taking use away from the land what he's asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8006)|
| 2:13:33| So he's asking for PR and you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| Up to in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| But in there, with that zero, you could also say part of that land could not be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| And not essentially it provides that if it were approved as recommended by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8026)|
| 2:13:54| it provides the developer or the owner with the option to do development up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| Up to three means you start at zero and go up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| We're not limiting him to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| We're saying up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| And within that density, he has the option to concentrate units in one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| to leave some of it undeveloped and do uniform development on the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| Again, it's kind of limiting the use of land because you can say on this part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| these three acres, it's .25 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| You can use on this and on this other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| You can use three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| And I'm not saying just for this particular property, when you suggested that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| is that zero in pled and residential seems like it could be a deterrent that could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8083)|
| 2:14:51| to not have the individual to develop his land like he's asking it to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| When it comes to the planning stage, not for the zoning, you understand what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8096)|
| 2:15:03| It looks like it could be used that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| And I don't want to set a precedent here for future developments where we start with zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| because if it's agricultural, you've already got one unit breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| And it's just a minor thing to me that, you know, you should be able to say one, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| And what it states is up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| And maybe I assume that when you say up to three, you start at zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| We could start at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| You know, it's up to three units breaker the intent of the planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| Yes, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| To allow creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| And so on this property, if the developers wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| they could concentrate all their development in one corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| and actually have undeveloped property conserved as open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| The planned residential designation provides that option for some creativity in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8148)|
| 2:15:56| So back to your question or your statement about one portion of it could be undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| That's true in the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| If you look at the overall property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| and the recommendation from the planning commission is that it be developed at a density up to three dwelling units breaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| calculated on the entire property to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| That was one of the things right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| The other thing, and I have a question on this thing, is the stipulations you put on the zoning, conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8178)|
| 2:16:28| Normally isn't that taken care of when you do the final plot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| when you put these conditional buffer zones and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| when you get with the planner and say this is what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| Because normally the first stage is you do the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| The sector plan says you can do this in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| Then from the sector plan you apply the zoning to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| And then you go to the plan stage and then you put the restrictions, which you're doing early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8210)|
| 2:16:57| That seems kind of anachronic in this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| Yes, and I think it's more consistent and provides the developer with better guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| Having worked in the private sector doing development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| I appreciated having standards known up front so that my clients did not spend their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| having me do plans that were then presented to the review bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| We were told at that point that we had standards we had to meet that we did not know of prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8244)|
| 2:17:30| In addition, by having the planning commission attach these conditions at the zoning stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| it gives the staff the assurance that when that plan is presented to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| the commission has already endorsed the conditions and we're not working in the blind, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| We have the endorsement of the planning commission that these standards are the items in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| that they want that development to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| So it provides both the staff and the developer with greater guidance in the development and review of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8275)|
| 2:18:05| Excuse me, Mr. Seymour, could I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| Did you understand what these conditions were when the final recommendation came out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8290)|
| 2:18:17| We understood them and we raised questions about them at the MPC meeting and objected to them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8297)|
| 2:18:25| We have suggested, as Mr. Green said, that there be a conservation easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| placed around the boundaries of the three homes that are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| We have offered to do vegetative buffers between them and our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8316)|
| 2:18:44| either on their side of the fence or our side of the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8324)|
| 2:18:56| My question is here, and I guess I'm just, the buffer is supposed to protect the property owners, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| We've offered actually a conservation easement that would border, if you look in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| there are three homes just to the north on Millstone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| We have offered to put a conservation easement on our property, around those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| so they would be additional, have additional distance from any home in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| Okay, so, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| And then we have offered to do vegetative buffers either on our side or their side, visual buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8370)|
| 2:19:41| Okay, Mr. Green, thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| Mr. Green, what protects the property owner from the uses that can be done on agricultural property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8384)|
| 2:19:51| There are no requirements for buffering or other protections of the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| So they could put sawmills, horses, cattle, everything else out there, but it doesn't, even slaughterhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8395)|
| 2:20:02| but demolition, landfills, so, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| So we're doing protection from part of it, but we're not doing protection for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8407)|
| 2:20:14| It's what we're doing here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Thank you, and I may ask Knox County Engineering to provide some insight to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| One of my concerns that I heard from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| Please speak in your, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| One of the concerns I heard from the neighborhood was around the subject of sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8432)|
| 2:20:37| In particular, being out there, I noticed that you've got, you're almost adjacent to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8437)|
| 2:20:42| I think you've got your mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| Hey, speak into the end of your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| Sorry, I leaned into it and pushed my mute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| One of my concerns was we're adjacent, almost adjacent to a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8449)|
| 2:20:55| and you've got a curb and gutter sidewalk coming down right in front of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| It stops at the school property line, and then, I couldn't tell you the exact footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| but maybe we're approximately 100 yards from there where I think the entrance to this neighborhood is intended to be on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| And I know that one of the ideas, you have to have sidewalks as we're walking into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| and I want to, if this passes, how do you, do we have some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| just personally, I'd like to see a curb and gutter so that you've got consistent sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| that are running from the neighborhood into the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| That's one point I'd like to ask Knox County Engineering to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| Secondly, and Mr. Green, just for confirmation from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| was this unanimously confirmed when it went through MPC, just to remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| I think I know that Mr. Smith is an MPC commissioner, so he reclused himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| but when this went through MPC, was this not unanimously concerned or confirmed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8510)|
| 2:21:56| Yes, sir, the vote was 14 to 0 with Mr. Smith's abstention on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Another final thing before Engineering addresses this, if they're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| was I think when we had our meeting in December, one of the directives out of that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| was to see if a meeting would take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| I'm curious if that took place and if there's any report out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| Right now we're asking questions that Mr. Green can answer, and I don't think he can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| Mr. Green, I'm sorry, I was just getting all my stuff out there, but go ahead and respond, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| I'm not aware of any meeting, but I probably would not have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| so that question would have to go to Mr. Seymour or Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| Mr. Seymour and Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8559)|
| 2:22:40| We have not taken testimony yet from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| We're still dealing with the input that we're receiving from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| Mr. Green, how large of a conservation buffer was suggested by the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| It varied in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| The minimum width was 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| I believe it goes up to at least 50 in some areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| but the minimum width of the conservation easement was 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| And the rear setback line would be to that point or be within that buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8593)|
| 2:23:19| The rear setback line would be measured from the edge of that buffer to the building or structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8599)|
| 2:23:26| And in PR, we are looking at a rear setback of 15, 25, 30 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| 25, so 75 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| Oh, 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| So anywhere from 85 to 70 feet from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8616)|
| 2:23:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| Seeing no further questions of MPC, Mr. Green, I recognize the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8629)|
| 2:24:01| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm not going to rehash everything we went over in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| I just want to emphasize a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| The property is 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| It is zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| The sector plan is low-density residential, up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| You've just approved three units on one development and four units on another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| Rufus Smith wasn't here, but I suspect when he gets here, he'll get five units on his first application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8666)|
| 2:24:35| In anticipation of questions, yes, we did meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| Mr. Smith called a meeting at his office two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8680)|
| 2:24:45| Three representatives came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| He suggested the buffering and the conservation easement and the landscaping buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| We have had no response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| The MPC recommendation was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| Issues have been raised about the right of way for the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| because the applicant will have to connect into the sidewalk mentioned at Middle Valley School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8705)|
| 2:25:13| and also widen the road to his entrance on Millstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| Documents have been provided to Knox County Engineering and to the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| Based on my conversations with Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| there is no issue that there is adequate right of way available for the applicant to construct these improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8726)|
| 2:25:35| which he will be required to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Mr. Mosley has a plat recorded in the Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| Mr. Mosley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| I'd like to have that filed as part of this proceedings, but I know the Law Department has reviewed that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8744)|
| 2:25:51| I would finally like to turn to Tiffany Dorn, who is the realtor representing Mr. Daniel, the owner of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8751)|
| 2:26:05| She deals in real properties in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| Let her give the commission her observations on the real property, if I may, and sales of homes in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| My name is Tiffany Dorn, and my address is 1121 Willowwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8777)|
| 2:26:26| I'm a real estate agent here, and I primarily focus on the West Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8786)|
| 2:26:31| and this particular location is ideal for the children walking to school specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8791)|
| 2:26:37| Great location for families, and inventory is extremely low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| so this is a great opportunity for families out there that are looking for homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| to be in a great location and keep people in here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| And how about its proximity to the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| The proximity to the school, again, walking distance, as is a lot of the neighborhoods along Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| that have the walking distance to A.L. Lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| If I may just conclude, I think I do have a minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| The stars are lined up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| We followed the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| The sector plan was set by you all when you adopted the sector plan last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| and I think the designation before last year was low-density residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8845)|
| 2:27:31| It has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| Their MPC staff recommended three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| We are in accord with that, up to three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| and the full MPC unanimously approved this when they reviewed the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8863)|
| 2:27:50| There are three homes, possibly four homes, that have larger lots in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| There are a lot more homes that have smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| There is planned residential catty corner across Millstone Road from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8878)|
| 2:28:04| that has planned residential at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8884)|
| 2:28:09| So you've got big lots, small lots, and some that are 12 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8889)|
| 2:28:15| which is four times what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| So it is certainly compatible across the broad range of what you find on Millstone Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8898)|
| 2:28:26| and George Williams Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| Also, one of the reasons MPC likes subdivisions like this is you have the schools there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8909)|
| 2:28:37| and these students who live in this subdivision will not have to be bused by Knox County to their middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8917)|
| 2:28:46| They're inside the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| So we would urge you to approve this request with a modification of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8929)|
| 2:28:59| that we simply buffer and use a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| Counselor Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| I'll again, like Mr. Seymour, I'll attempt to not reiterate a lot of the points that we made last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8955)|
| 2:29:22| We had a long hearing, and everyone's familiar with what transpired there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| I would like to address some of the issues that have arisen since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| and also address some of the concerns that were raised at that last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| One of the concerns that was raised by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| was a concern about whether if a lower density was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| about whether that would in fact be consistent with the other neighborhoods that are in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| Obviously, what we've referred to as a micro-neighborhood of Millstone and Freels Lane is large lot residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8989)|
| 2:29:55| but there's kind of been this false narrative put forward that everything in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=8995)|
| 2:30:01| except for my client's properties, is high density or medium density or at least higher density than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9001)|
| 2:30:09| But if we look to some of the other subdivisions in the area, based on our calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| the Statesview subdivision that's directly across north of George Williams is zoned RA with approximately 1.5 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9014)|
| 2:30:23| Seven Oaks subdivision, which is northwest of Statesview, is zoned agricultural with less than 1 home per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9023)|
| 2:30:30| The High Point subdivision west of Statesview is zoned A and RA at approximately 1 home per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9030)|
| 2:30:36| The Woodland Springs subdivision immediately west of Gettysview is zoned PR with less than 2 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| And the Racket Club at Gettysview, immediately south of Gettysview, is zoned PR with less than 2 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9042)|
| 2:30:49| So densities, like what we are suggesting, less than 3 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9049)|
| 2:30:56| is entirely consistent with other development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| As Mr. Seymour points out, it is a mixed bag out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| Nobody's going to dispute that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| But asking for 2 or somewhere in that area is not going to make this subdivision an outlier in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9067)|
| 2:31:15| It's going to make it consistent with other development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| And I'll also note that Mr. Seymour points out a lot about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| Well, the sector plan would also approve 2 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| That's a low-density residential designation that would be appropriate within this portion of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9088)|
| 2:31:35| So that would comply just as much as what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| One of the biggest concerns that I've heard from you all and from my conversations with others has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9101)|
| 2:31:49| what I think has been some fear-mongering about the developer being able to come around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| and get this decision overturned if you all don't approve it consistent with the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9115)|
| 2:32:03| And I've sent you all a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| I know that you all have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| with the County Commission Office that outlines the scope of judicial review on zoning decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| that makes abundantly clear that if there's any conceivable basis for this body's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9132)|
| 2:32:17| in making a zoning decision, that that will stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| And we've put forward a number of arguments that are consistent with the factors that have been outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9140)|
| 2:32:25| by the Tennessee cases, by the Court of Appeals, by the Tennessee Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| as appropriate factors for consideration by this body in making zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| Issues such as the general opposition of the community like we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| issues like the impact that it's going to have on neighboring communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| impacts that it's going to have on schools, impacts that it's going to have on traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| questions and concerns about the adequacy of existing infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| and the ability of that infrastructure to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| All of those factors are appropriate for consideration by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| The only factor is not is it consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| We will give you that it's consistent with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| but there are a myriad of other factors that may be considered by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| all of which we've raised to you and are appropriate for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| So if the concern of this body is that by siding with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| you're going to get overturned and embarrassed in Chancery Court or in the Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| There are plenty of justifications for the zoning density that the community has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9206)|
| 2:33:39| Along that same line, there's been the suggestion that because MPC has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| a particular recommendation that that's somehow binding on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| But MPC's recommendation is nothing more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| It's a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| They're an advisory body that is a necessary step in the statutory zoning scheme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| but Tennessee case law makes abundantly clear that this body is the final decider on zoning decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9240)|
| 2:34:07| and they make abundantly clear that this body is not required to follow MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9247)|
| 2:34:15| You are the governing body that has the legislative prerogative to set zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| not the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| And they're very good at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| I have immense respect for Mr. Green and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| but the community members here think that they got this one wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| And we would respectfully ask that you all listen to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| listen to their concerns, and allow them to dictate what's going to happen with their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9275)|
| 2:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| Counselor Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9285)|
| 2:34:50| I hope we have not used scare tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| I think we have used rational reasoning to support this zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| We have worked with MPC staff on this to come up with a rational zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9299)|
| 2:35:09| MPC staff has very thoroughly reviewed this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| knowing that there was some controversy from the outset about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9313)|
| 2:35:18| But three units per acre is a very good compromise that MPC staff has come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9318)|
| 2:35:27| Yes, the neighborhood is a mixed bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| The neighborhoods that Mr. Collins referred to a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| summer zone C3, plan residential 3, which Getty's view is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9334)|
| 2:35:43| Now, how you build it out depends on your final development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| It's rare, if you all approve this zoning, that you can get 120 units on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9347)|
| 2:35:56| You may be able to, you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| The property has really no site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| There's not a creek on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| There's not a slope issue on it, except in a very small part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| So it's the type of real property that subdivision developers love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9369)|
| 2:36:16| Here in Knox County, we're running out of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| A home building is fortunately rebounded in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| and I think Ms. Dorn would agree that there are very few lots available at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9384)|
| 2:36:32| to satisfy the demands of people who want homes in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9392)|
| 2:36:37| Now, they can always go elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| but Knox County has always supported reasonable residential development throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9400)|
| 2:36:47| and I submit respectfully that's what this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| and we would ask you to approve this with modified conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| And Councilor Collins, your last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9417)|
| 2:37:11| I don't agree that we're running out of land in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| and I'm not sure that Mr. Green would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9433)|
| 2:37:18| This is a 40-acre tract in a large tract area in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9438)|
| 2:37:26| This is not appropriate for the type of infill that they're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| To do so would be wildly inconsistent with the densities of the surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| the adjacent area, and the subdivisions that they suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9456)|
| 2:37:43| the higher densities and such that they're relying on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| are not subdivisions that have the same types of infrastructure constraints that this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| They're not the types of subdivisions that are bounded by higher-density lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9471)|
| 2:37:56| that have no real prospect for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| This is a unique piece of property that needs to be considered in a unique way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| and I don't think that it's fair to put blanket statements that apply to the whole county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9484)|
| 2:38:10| on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| If this was that generic of a zoning decision, we wouldn't be back here a second time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| and we wouldn't be running on three hours of county commission hearings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| My fellow commissioners, that would conclude the testimony of the applicant in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| We are now entering a phase by our rule where commissioners question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9509)|
| 2:38:37| raise any question that they would of the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9517)|
| 2:38:40| and I believe Commissioner Bussler's light is on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| Can I address Mr. Green one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9531)|
| 2:38:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9532)|
| 2:38:53| Mr. Green, I just asked you that the sector plan was done a year, you said a year and a half ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9533)|
| 2:39:00| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| Now, I sat on the MPC many years ago before I had gray hair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9542)|
| 2:39:08| and what we used to do when we had some sort of sector plans going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9548)|
| 2:39:15| we had the public very much involved into the development of their area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9555)|
| 2:39:23| and we took public input in how they wanted that property around them to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9563)|
| 2:39:33| And at that point in time, back then, if it was agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| and we said we see that this is going to be zone residential, planned residential, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9576)|
| 2:39:44| how do you want it to look to get their input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| And back then we took, well, we want it to remain more open and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| Maybe they said we'd like to see, you know, if it's developed no more than two units or one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9594)|
| 2:40:00| But what happened in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| what was the input that you got for the development of that area from the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| For this particular area, there was no comment on the proposed designation by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9610)|
| 2:40:17| and again, the prior sector plan also had a low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9617)|
| 2:40:22| Was there any input from the public on that sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| There was a good deal of input on the overall sector plan, but not on this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| So we didn't get anything, even though it was just a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9631)|
| 2:40:36| there was nothing said how they wanted it to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| It's just kind of a general, what you took was just a general sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9639)|
| 2:40:45| nothing particular that you really quizzed the public for of what they saw in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9645)|
| 2:40:52| Not on this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| Again, we continued to do the extensive outreach and community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| and there were no comments on this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| Thank you. Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9665)|
| 2:41:08| A couple of questions. Let's start with Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| The subdivision across the street, and I guess the closest to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9672)|
| 2:41:17| is bordered by Millstone and George Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| I guess the name of it is Shady Mill, maybe, or something, wherever that neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| You know what I'm talking about right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| I'm counting 48 houses right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9686)|
| 2:41:30| Is that like a 10-acre tract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| Yes, and again, this is zone PR up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| Was it? Okay, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| All right, Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9699)|
| 2:41:45| You know, I think, and this isn't directed necessarily to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| but I think this is probably right smack dab in the middle of the population of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9710)|
| 2:41:55| and I think the difficulty we have here is that there's change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9715)|
| 2:42:00| That's about the only thing that's guaranteed is things are going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| but I do believe the community has a right to oversee their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| or see what changes happen there, but there will be change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9729)|
| 2:42:14| So in this situation, if I heard you correctly, you said two per acre was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9734)|
| 2:42:23| I think in an ideal world, the community members would say one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9743)|
| 2:42:29| You know, leave it alone at agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| There's nothing wrong with it, and they can put 40 houses down there, and that will be beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| But I think as a compromise, the community is willing to accept two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9757)|
| 2:42:43| I mean, that's 80 houses, and he's wanting 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| And it's 40 more than what we want, so it's a nice compromise, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| Well, a compromise would be two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9772)|
| 2:42:57| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| Yeah, I mean, if you're talking one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| All right, but you are saying that two the community is fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| I think the community would be accepting of that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| With the conditions attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9795)|
| 2:43:16| I understand that MPC recommended attached for the buffering and the roadway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| Mr. Seymour, I'm guessing two is not acceptable to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9804)|
| 2:43:29| No, we talked about this at the last meeting and after the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9809)|
| 2:43:34| And our client, they originally asked for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| And staff knocked them down to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| This is, to make this an economically viable subdivision, that is the lowest they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9823)|
| 2:43:49| So it's 120 or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9831)|
| 2:43:52| For you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9832)|
| 2:43:53| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| And Mr. Smith and Mr. Mosley, we talked about this, and I think you all would agree with that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9834)|
| 2:44:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9841)|
| 2:44:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| And Commissioner Thomas, I want to build on your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| I got halfway there on the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| If it's 120, if it's 120, what's the house going to be in this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9849)|
| 2:44:18| What's three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| That would be three, 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| Is that what your question is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| It's 120 locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| What's the price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| What's these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| It's relevant to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| Typically, 275 to three and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Or to 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| 275, 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| And I'm talking to the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9881)|
| 2:44:42| And they've done, I don't know, how many lots in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9882)|
| 2:44:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| Yeah, I've got two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| One, I wanted to comment on Commissioner Bustler's statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| I sat in on those southwest county sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| and the citizens that attended those meetings don't single out a single track of land to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9897)|
| 2:45:03| we think this should be used for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| It's more of a general overview of where they'd like to have a county park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9906)|
| 2:45:11| why they think that North Shore Drive should be three or four lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9911)|
| 2:45:16| that they don't want to have commercial development at Westland Drive and the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9916)|
| 2:45:21| But at no time are they instructed by MPC staff, and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9921)|
| 2:45:27| that they're supposed to go up and single out a piece of property and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9927)|
| 2:45:32| this only needs to have one or two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| And is that a fair statement from those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| This is for Mr. Seymour and team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9943)|
| 2:45:49| I can't really see from my direction, but is Mr. Mosley here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9949)|
| 2:45:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9955)|
| 2:45:56| At last month's meeting, he was unsure of how much acreage he had under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9956)|
| 2:46:03| Has he figured that out yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| And have you figured out how many acres you're going to carve out for the estate-sized lots that are part of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9964)|
| 2:46:12| I'm going to let Mr. Smith answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9972)|
| 2:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| Scott Smith, 1476 Linesman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| We have the entire property under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| It's the whole 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| I think the question was about the house that's existing, and it will be cut into about a two-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| And Mr. Daniels has the right to stay in that house if he wants, take it out, or sell it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9991)|
| 2:46:38| So I think he's building a house somewhere, so he can either stay there, keep that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=9998)|
| 2:46:44| or we've already preset a price that we'll always give him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10004)|
| 2:46:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| And then the log cabin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| The log cabin he's keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| So that's another carve-out of an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10015)|
| 2:46:56| So it's two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| One's two-acre, one's one-acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10017)|
| 2:46:58| Well, that log cabin is not any part of the property we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| Oh, it's not under contract of the 40 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| So it's really 38 acres that you're going to be developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| It's 40 acres that we have under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| So I guess my question is, so the two acres you're talking about, Mr. Daniels' house, is not part of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10032)|
| 2:47:17| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| He's got two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| He's got a house that I think his brother-in-law lives in, a log-style home, and then he's got his big estate house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10042)|
| 2:47:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10048)|
| 2:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10049)|
| 2:47:30| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10050)|
| 2:47:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10051)|
| 2:47:32| And then did you hear the conversation, I guess it was from Hugh Nystrom, yes, I'm still addressing you, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| about the extension of Millstone Lane, the improvements that you're going to have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10058)|
| 2:47:43| where that you start out with curb and gutter and drainage, and then at the intersection of your development it's going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10063)|
| 2:47:53| And then apparently from engineering and public works you're not required to do the curb and gutter and apron for that 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10073)|
| 2:48:03| Yeah, all the road improvement work, like on any subdivision, any rezoning, any plan that's submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10083)|
| 2:48:10| there will be language if a road is substandard that the developer will be responsible in most cases for making road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10090)|
| 2:48:17| to make sure it's wide enough and safe enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| And so the county will kind of work with our engineer and tell them what they want there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10099)|
| 2:48:25| So we will be required to do whatever the county roads department decides is appropriate for that section of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10105)|
| 2:48:32| So, I mean, we're not saying we want to do no curbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| We're not, we're just, I mean, we know that we do the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| We're going to have to accommodate what the roads department wants us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10119)|
| 2:48:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| Scott, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| I guess really my question, I know we're talking 1 to 3 or up to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10134)|
| 2:49:01| What have we, have we submitted a site plan yet to the MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| You know, I think early on we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| And I think we started this process like last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| And we had five or six delays at MPC because there was confusion over the road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| But right now I don't believe we have a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| We're going to get, figure out if we can get our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10167)|
| 2:49:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10168)|
| 2:49:29| Yeah, it may be the one that was initially submitted that really won't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| I guess my question is going to lean, I guess you don't have to answer if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| How many lots did it have on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| Did it have 120 or did it have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| Honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10182)|
| 2:49:43| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10183)|
| 2:49:44| I don't even remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| It had, you know, whatever the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| Did you have it up to the five on that preliminary plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10190)|
| 2:49:54| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10194)|
| 2:49:55| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| I don't quite frankly remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10198)|
| 2:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| I mean it's really not even, we can't develop a plan without knowing whether our zoning and our density is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10201)|
| 2:50:08| Because we don't have any lots we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10208)|
| 2:50:09| But the roads will probably stay in somewhat the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10209)|
| 2:50:13| You have to build a new road into the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| So you're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| I'm just trying to guess how many, you know, we rezoned over across from Getty's View one to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| And I think it's built out about two and a half, two and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| So I'm trying to get a number of what it's going to build out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10225)|
| 2:50:28| The Racquet Club at Getty's View that he was talking about is built out at two, but it's zoned four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10228)|
| 2:50:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| Within the last 24 months, we've done on Westland Gardens at 3.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10234)|
| 2:50:40| We've done the one on Ebenezer at, I think it was approved at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| What did those two build out at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| We get close to three, a little bit more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| And then Moorfield Road is the other one that we did where we got into kind of a negotiating of density back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| But it was about 3.1 or 3.2 I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| But the build out is going to be different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| Do you think on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| Usually when you get a cap on your density, in this case, I would say it will be right up against that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| But in a lot of cases, you start working through the engineering and the layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| and you end up with a little less than what your cap was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10275)|

| 2:51:21| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10281)|
| 2:51:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10288)|
| 2:51:31| It's kind of hard really to know where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| It's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| This has taken a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| I've spent a lot of time, a lot of thought, studying and studying, going down to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10298)|
| 2:51:47| And it's really hard to vote on something when you don't know what you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10307)|
| 2:51:55| I have a question for Mr. Rann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| Did she, Doran, did she stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| And you might can just answer from your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10323)|
| 2:52:12| But the question I had was, are you here because you're representing Mr. Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10332)|
| 2:52:19| that you have his house with the five acres listed for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| Yes, ma'am, I do have his property listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| Okay, because it is on the website and it is listed for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| including five acres and the barn and the stall and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10353)|
| 2:52:39| And when did you list it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10359)|
| 2:52:44| We originally listed it in October of 2015, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10364)|
| 2:52:49| Okay, but then it was taken off the market and then you relisted it, according to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10369)|
| 2:52:56| No, we never took it off and relisted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10376)|
| 2:52:59| It was previously listed by another agent for a couple of years, just the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10379)|
| 2:53:02| Keller Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| And then it was listed November 7th of 2016 by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10384)|
| 2:53:10| No, it's been under contract ever since May of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10390)|
| 2:53:15| Well, that's not what your website says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10398)|
| 2:53:20| So the question is, his last meeting, I think Mr. Daniel was unsure how much acreage was going to go with the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10400)|
| 2:53:31| and was also mentioned that the barn and all was going to be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| I don't know what their plan is for the barn after the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10419)|
| 2:53:45| I mean, look, I cannot vote with a clear conscience for the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10425)|
| 2:53:51| including Mr. Daniel, the property owner, Mr. Smith and Mr. Mosley, the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10431)|
| 2:53:59| I cannot vote until I know what I'm voting on, and I'm getting all these different answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10439)|
| 2:54:06| And so after a while I'm like, what is the truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10446)|
| 2:54:10| Because a while ago it was two acres with the house, and the log cabin that Mr. Daniel owns also sets what I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10450)|
| 2:54:21| from looking at the map and who owns what, also sets on that 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10461)|
| 2:54:27| So if you already have two existing homes on the 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10467)|
| 2:54:33| for us to rezone and to know what it is and how many houses is going to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10473)|
| 2:54:40| we have to know exactly how many acres we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10480)|
| 2:54:44| And I think I can clarify that a little bit for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10484)|
| 2:54:47| So on the listing, we had two listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| We had one for commercial, which had all of the acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| and then we had one on the residential MLS because of the two MLSs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10493)|
| 2:54:58| So if I pull up the MLS, I can show you where it was set to pending, and it was only set to pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10498)|
| 2:55:05| It was never taken back off and put back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| In the original contract, it's for the home and 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| and the log cabin, which Mr. Daniel owns, was cut out of that completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10513)|
| 2:55:18| It was never a part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| So when Mr. Smith and Mr. Mosley purchased the property in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10520)|
| 2:55:27| potentially, then what their plan is is to cut Mr. Daniel's home out of that with two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10527)|
| 2:55:34| and either Mr. Daniel continue to live in the home or it would be sold later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| Well, Mr. Daniel has already said he wasn't planning on living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10540)|
| 2:55:46| So now we know that two acres, even though you have it listed with five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10546)|
| 2:55:53| and then additional acreage is available to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10553)|
| 2:55:59| On the commercial MLS, which is under Mark Dorn, my husband, that is for the house and all the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10559)|
| 2:56:06| No, I'm only talking about what you have listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| What you have listed says that you have the house and five acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| and then there's also additional acreage to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10574)|
| 2:56:21| So what is the address on the log cabin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| It is not sitting on the 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10584)|
| 2:56:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10588)|
| 2:56:29| So what address is the log cabin on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| Because it states that everything that Mr. Daniel owns is all in that 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10591)|
| 2:56:38| Listen, I'm just trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10598)|
| 2:56:41| Oh, absolutely. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| In the contract, it is cut out as being the log cabin not being a part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10603)|
| 2:56:49| It was never a part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| Now, I'm getting back to the 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| The log cabin sits on the 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| No, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| Okay, what is the address of the log cabin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| I don't know the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| Because everything that you pull up in that entire area that has Mr. Daniel as the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10624)|
| 2:57:12| and another gentleman, is 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10632)|
| 2:57:17| The total is 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| So I can't figure out where the log cabin is if it's not included in the 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| May I answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10644)|
| 2:57:25| Eddie Daniel, 825 Frills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| The log cabin is not part of the 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| It sits at 803 Frills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| And my brother, who's here, resides in that residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10654)|
| 2:57:39| It was not part of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| It's not part of the contract to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| Never has been, won't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| So to make the issue clear here to Commissioner Carringer, it's 40 acres is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10671)|
| 2:57:58| Mine is the two acres that his home sits on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| So 38 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| No, it's 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| We're just talking about a rezoning of 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| Commissioner Carringer, you're continuing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| Commissioner Smith, we're in the phase of asking questions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10698)|
| 2:58:24| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10704)|
| 2:58:25| I have a question for Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| Given the way this property stair steps back in there, you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10711)|
| 2:58:36| The jagged corners, which don't make for very good road radiuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10716)|
| 2:58:43| With the conservation easement, the setback, how far, the 35-foot setback, the conservation easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10723)|
| 2:58:53| that's, I think we were told, 25 to 50 foot wide at different points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10733)|
| 2:58:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10738)|
| 2:58:59| How far do you anticipate the back of these houses being to the property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10739)|
| 2:59:07| I'm just going to, I mean, if the lot's 170 feet deep, front setbacks are 20, so you've got off the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10747)|
| 2:59:18| They usually want to put houses at the very front of the lot because it's expensive to run utilities and driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| So it's going to be at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| Yeah, I don't know, 70 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10767)|
| 2:59:30| I don't know, the back of the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170123?start=10770)|
