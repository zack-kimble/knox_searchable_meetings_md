| 1:43:09| Item 13| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Resolution R-10-9-401 is to approve in a contract with Waste Connections of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| Inc., for Solid Waste Disposal Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| at a rate of $22.35 per ton from Municipal Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| If we could have someone from Engineering and Public Works come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| What I would like to do in talking with the Mayor's office is when we have these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| I'd like to lump them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| so that when, for example, these folks are finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| can go ahead and leave instead of staying. Although I know that you would love to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| for a longer period of time, but any questions of Mr. VandeVeet of item 13? Could you explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| to us, Dwight, exactly what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Mr. Chairman, these RFPs were put together prior to my tenure at Engineering and Solid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| Waste, but John King is here representing the responsive bidder and Hugh Holt is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| from Purchasing, and I had asked both of them to be prepared to respond to any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| but these are the compactor pulls from the eight convenience centers across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| both waste pulls and recyclable pulls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Any questions on item 13? Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:20| Who is here, did you say, Dwight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Hugh Holt can speak to the bidding process. Also, Mr. King represents the responsive bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| We did have multiple bidders, and he represents the bidder who was selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| Let's start off with the bid process. Hugh, you're going for $22.35 per ton now. What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:43| Well, let me defer to Tom Salter for the current numbers. It is a savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| That's what we like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| Hey, my name is Tom Salter, 1000 Sky Blue Drive. The current tipping fee for the solid waste, the garbage boxes, is $24 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6291)|
| 1:45:02| $24? And that's with solid waste now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| And you're going to $22.35?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Is anybody here from solid waste, I mean from waste disposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| John King is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| I need a company rep, Johnny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| I got that one here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| Yeah, see here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| Could you come to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| I know that gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| I'm John King, here on behalf of the company who's being proposed for the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:51| It's Waste Connections of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| I have with me Doug McGill, who's their municipal marketing manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| As pointed out, this was a ---there were actually two contracts in which my client is interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:07| One deals with disposal and one deals with hauling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| This particular one is for the disposal at a rate of $22.35, which is less than the current contract calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| And while you're there, talk about the hauling then, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| You or Doug, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| The hauling is item number 22 on your agenda for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| and that is, again, to approve a contract with Waste Connections of Tennessee for the roll-off hauling services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:46| for the convenience centers at an average, and that's what they did on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| There was quite an elaborate process that we went through in doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| but the average haul rate is a little over $100 per haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| It's 101 and some odd cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| John, what's the difference between 13 and 22 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| One is you're actually disposing of the waste that you're picking up and hauling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| and the other one is just the hauling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Is that not just one bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| So to haul it off it's going to be $124 total or $123 total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| Is that what we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| How does that work, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| Can you explain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| It depends on the weight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| The hauling is based on each container being pulled from a convenience center site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| So that's one haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Then based on the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| That's $101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| That's 101, 105, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| And then when they get it there, then they weigh it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| Then we weigh it on certified scales at the 20-something dollars per ton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| and it's billed out, counted out like three different decimal points, like 6.85 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| Sir, could I get your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Douglas McGill, 7612 McGill Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| And then, Doug, this item number 22 where it's $101 per haul, what is it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| Or maybe Tom answers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| That was $101 is based upon the average of what they commingled all the hauls from a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| and averaged them out to evaluate the bid process, have the bid process evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| Dutchtown cost more to haul than one at Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| So it's the haul times to the transfer station, to the facility, to the landfilling site makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:37| What they did was added up all the hauls and then took a basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| In my opinion, that's the way they did it, to evaluate it, and I'm sure that's the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| Tom, do you have any comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| So that's what we averaged for last year, Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| Yes, Commissioner, and we believe based on what was submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| the hauling part will be about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| Doug, one question to ask you, or it may be Tom, I don't know, but when we were doing this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| what kind of assurances can you give to Knox County and the people that use the convenience center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| This was a big issue, and I think this is how you all, in a sense, got the bid a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:14| On Saturdays are your busiest days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| What kind of assurance do you have that they don't have waiting in lines and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| Can you give us, or Tom, tell us how, what happened before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| what sold me on the idea is that you all would change those out up to 1 o'clock in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| when they close at 3 on the Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| So we still got something like that going, because those lines can really back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| and you've got a bunch of them just sitting there not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| We still have that in place, Commissioner, where we can call quite late in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| and we also have a provision to stage empty boxes at the convenience centers parked over at the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| The large centers like Halls, Powell, John Sevier, we can easily do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| There's plenty of room, and those are the centers that typically run into trouble on space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| And even if the hauler for some reason couldn't take it to a disposal site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| they can swap the empty box on site and just park it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| So we do have those provisions in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| I remember you talking about that last time, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Tom, what about, it seems the one that gets to be filled up the quickest is this construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| the one where you throw your lumber and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| I just know the one at Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| I don't know if Powell has one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| But can we get more than that on a Saturday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| Can we think ahead on a Saturday when we get that and try to have three of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| We stage some empty what we call open tops after the two compactor boxes are filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| and I'll check with my staff, but I think we've been keeping up better with that recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:44| But we could even stage another open top for overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| Doug, do you have any comments or any commitments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| Because when I'm out there every Saturday, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| I get different comments from different people and I want to be able to give them reassurance that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| I believe I put in my response, our response, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| that we will pick up anything to 3 o'clock to keep the centers open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:08| I think I even put that in the letter of introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| Isn't that correct, Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| We're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| We're going to keep the transfer station open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| Knox County calls in a container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| By 1 or 2 o'clock, we'll get out there and get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| as long as they give us an hour until they shut the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| It takes us an hour or so to get to the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| Tom, since the time you've been there, have you ever had where you were completely full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| Because I know at one time, and it may have been four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| I mean, I'm not going to say we haven't, but I know we've closed 15 minutes early or 30 minutes early from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| But it's not very often, and I think we've worked very hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| and I know that our contractors have worked hard to provide, to keep the centers open until 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| It was a Saturday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| It was like 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| It's been several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| It was like 12 o'clock, and it was already full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| And they were some irate people, and I don't blame them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| And if we hadn't had Gibbs open and Powell open, where to send them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| I don't think we've had anything like that recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| I think we've had some quarter to three problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| Just have your people that work in the tower not to be afraid to pick up that phone and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| Call Doug's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Y'all are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| If you call in, we'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| Item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| It's resolution R-10-9-402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| It's approving a contract with Poplar View Landfill, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| for solid waste disposal services at a rate of $17 per ton for bulky construction and demolition disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| $34 per ton for bulky construction and demolition recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| and $0 per ton for clean field disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| Any questions about that from any commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| What's the cost now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Are there any savings, or is it going up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| This is the same cost for the bulky waste disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| The bulky waste recycling is we bid that for an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| We don't have to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| We don't intend to do it now, but it's there if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| And the $0 per ton for clean fill is a new price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| Right now, this isn't necessarily material we would haul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| but the highway department, when they clean out a ditch, they may have a truckload of soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| This material will now have a $0 disposal fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| In the past, we were paying just regular landfill fees for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| So this does represent a savings for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| Whose idea was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| It's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Who did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| It was, to split it up, it was a joint decision in our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| but Drew Thurman worked real hard on the specs for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| Tom, explain to me why I'm just missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| Why does it cost twice as much to recycle demolition material as to dispose of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| Am I reading that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| First of all, right now, we do not have any intention of recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| but we bid that just to see how much it would cost in the event we need to do some recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| This material often has to be recycled by hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| It's pulling recyclable wood and metal out of construction waste boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| but I just want to point out we don't have any plans to do this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| but we have a price in the event we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| So, therefore, it can be recycled, but in essence has a negative value to recycle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| It does have a negative value, yeah, and we're not going to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| Or like glass can at certain points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| Glass can go negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| Hopefully people won't put metal in these boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| It's mostly wood and drywall and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| Okay, but the metal would have some true value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| The metal would have value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| As opposed to lumber or drywall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| It's our staff's responsibility at the centers to encourage people not to put the metal in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| to put it in the metal pile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| Item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| Item 15 is resolution R-10-9-403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| It's approving a contract with Riverside C&D Landfill LLC for solid waste disposal services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| at a rate of zero dollars for clean fill disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| This question may be for Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| You are, Tom, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| But I know that there are some issues, some concerns from the community out there at Riverside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| They've had a good working relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| but I think they were asking for additional permits to do more, I guess, work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:45| And I know that the community had some concerns with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| So I would just hate for us to get in a situation where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| we're a party to a large group of strolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| Commissioner, we've got a representative from that landfill here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| and I know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| There was a proposal submitted to the Regional Solid Waste Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| and to TDEC to build a Class I landfill on top of an old city landfill at that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| and they withdrew that request at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| And this service that we're bidding is only to take clean fill dirt and block and brick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| and drop it off for free if we do collect that material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| It has nothing to do with the creation of a Class I landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| And Larry here can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| Yeah, I know that they withdrew it, but there's, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| still some feelings that at one time in the not-too-too-distant future you all may reintroduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| I just want to, again, make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| I know the county won't be held liable or anything like that to get involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| but from a, you know, political standpoint, do we want to be adding to a potential problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| So that's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| So you don't have to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| Actually, Larry Seavers' Riverside Landfill, 3650 Hood Circle, Louisville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| that was obviously not Riverside Landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| That was Poplar View Landfill that the Class I was discussed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| Close to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| Nine miles away out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| The conversation I'm talking about, I was talking about the one off of Delrose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| That was not any discussion ever of Class I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| It went from a Class IV to a Class III, which there is no longer Class IV for solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| Class III is just your accepting brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| That's the only difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| Item 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| It's Resolution R-10-9-406.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| It's approving a joint funding agreement in the amount of $106,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7076)|

| 1:58:15| Any questions for Mr. VandeVeid on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| Item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| Do we need to put these on the consent agenda as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| Yeah, what I was going to do is when we get through with Engineering Public Works, ask if we could just put them all on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| Item 19 is Resolution R-10-9-407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7113)|

| 1:59:34| including without limitation, implement water quality education programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| and assist with EPA stormwater compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Any questions for Mr. VandeVeid about Item 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| Would you consider adding items for our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| Items 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:58| Now, we did discuss Item 22. Do we need more discussion on 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| Okay, she needs to read that in the record, and then if it's okay, we'll put all those on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| This is Resolution R-10-9-410, approving a contract with Waste Connections of Tennessee, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| for solid waste roll-off hauling services with costs based on the distance hauled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| and an average haul rate of $1.56 per haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| So if it's okay with everybody, we'll put all those on consent for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Tom, just real quick, I don't know if you can answer this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| but Commissioner Shouse was asking this and sort of got my curiosity up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| What last year was our biggest dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| What was the best thing that we recycled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| Probably in order, it's metal, cardboard, mixed paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| And then after that, the price of the material goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| But was metal way up there above the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| Metal is probably equal to all the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| We go to different groups, and I just need to encourage these other groups what to bring the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7257)|
| 2:01:04| Aluminum primarily, Larry, the cans, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| I believe that's all for engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| So we'll see you folks next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| Yes, sir, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| I just have a question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| These items that go on consent, when Monday's meeting comes, they will be read as consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| And if anybody is here who has something they want to say on those, will there be an opportunity for them to take it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:33| So, I mean, I want to make sure we're here in case we need to be here, is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| Yes, any commissioner can ask for anything to be removed for further questioning, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| I'd like to move to item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| If there's no objections, the sheriff has asked that we go ahead and address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| So clerk, if you'd read item number 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| It's resolution R-10-9-904, requesting that the Knox County Criminal Justice Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| in conjunction with the Helen Ross McNabb Center, exhaustively study all available potential funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| public-private partnerships and intergovernmental partnerships between the county, city, state and federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:11| for the purpose of creating a public safety center and report their findings accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:17| We went to the detention facility a couple of weeks ago and had quite a discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| Sheriff Jones and General Nichols, do you have a recommendation for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:41| Randall E. Nichols, 8601 Delmere, Knoxville 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| Yes, we ask the commission to move ahead with all dispatch towards signaling your support for the safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:55| so that we can move forward with the request to HUD for the capital financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| We believe it's incumbent that it needs to move forward and it needs to move forward as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:09| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Yeah, I think it's important that we look at this resolution and, I mean, obviously discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| but this is not spending any money on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| This is asking HUD whether or not this is a viable opportunity to spend HUD dollars to build this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:29| You know, we do need to seek other partnerships, other government entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| Some of our other budgets went through the sheriff's budget, possibly through indigent care budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:42| but if we sit and do nothing, it's going to cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| You're going to build another part of the jail for $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| And so I think it's imperative that we realize that this resolution, if it passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| does not spend a nickel other than what it takes to study this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| And if HUD comes back and says, you can build it, and Knox County says, never mind, we just send the money back to HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:11| we're not out anything to study whether or not that this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| I mean, we already know this is going to be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| It's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| There's not every aspect of this center that I like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| but it's a necessary center to deal with the mental health issues and some of the chronically homeless in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| I want to be repeating just a little bit of the things that Commissioner Andrews just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| but this does not commit the county to building this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| All this says is that what's required for the grant is that the federal government says they have to have a commitment for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:52| that after this building is built with federal money that somebody will take responsibility for running it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| And that's all that we're doing is that we're saying we will, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| if the whole thing goes through, that we will provide the funds to run this after it gets started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:09| I like to play with numbers a lot, and I looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| If we do build a $20 million pod, the yearly rate to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| basically this is an amortization that I did, and it's $20 million at a 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| It's $1.326 million that we would be paying for the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| That's assuming a 20-year payoff on a bond if we had to build another pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| $1.326 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| That does not include the expenses of the personnel to run it, the maintenance to run it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| And then also when we looked at having the intake center, I guess it was about almost two years ago in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7544)|
| 2:05:52| that there's considerable transportation expenses if we have more prisoners running them back and forth between Maloneyville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7552)|
| 2:05:59| and the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| I know some people said we're rushing into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| I have a timeline right here of what all has happened, and it really goes back to 1986 when the Carver lawsuit was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:14| This is not something that's really come up just over the last month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| This is something that's really been a process that we've been trying to come up with a solution for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:26| But they've seriously looked at some alternative to putting some of these people in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| when there's an alternative, a less expensive alternative, for really about the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| And I know the last year we've had multiple lunch meetings, multiple dinner meetings with the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:45| and the sheriff and other members who are interested in looking at all the different alternatives for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:52| And I agree with what Commissioner Anders says, is that this is something that I think we do need to go forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7612)|
| 2:07:02| We won't know exactly how we're going to pay with it until this plays out, but what we're doing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| we're allowing that grant application to be made to the federal government for the community development block grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:15| so we can have the capital funds to get this off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| Mr. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| I want to make sure that if we pass this that we do more than just see if we can get the 108 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:34| I mean, it says to exhaustively study all available and potential funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| because personally I'm still not comfortable using the 108 funds going through that process for the capital costs for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| So I would like for the committee to do what this resolution says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| which is look at all options, not just the 108 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| And also I'd like to have my name added to this as a sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| Will we have time to discuss this later on who's going to run the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:15| Or is this just to approve them doing the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| Or is it already etched in stone that Helen Ross McNabb is the only vendor that we've?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| There was an RFP, I believe, and they responded to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Mr. Black or Hugh Holt, would you like to come and explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| Also folks from Helen Ross McNabb are here too if you'd like to ask them a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:38| Hugh Holt, Director of Purchasing, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| Commissioner, to answer your question, yes, there was an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| We had one response and that was Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| Do you have any questions you'd like to ask of McNabb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| I just wanted to point out there was just a news release that's come out really since this meeting started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| that the Hamilton County Jail is losing its Tennessee Corrections Institute certification because of problems with overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7743)|
| 2:09:11| So this isn't just a problem that we've got here in Knox County, it's a problem elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| We do, the Justice Committee does go before the federal judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| We were going every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| I think it's every other month because it looks like we're making progress with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| If we do reach an overcrowding situation, it's a $5,000 a day penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| Also, you know, I'd like to point out I think that some of the savings that we may be looking at is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| I think it's around $400,000 a year that we're paying for psychiatric drugs out of the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| The county is also responsible for the health care of any of these inmates that once they've been put in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7786)|
| 2:09:54| and if they have to go to the hospital, they have to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| And I can tell you recently we've been seeing some of these drug addicts that have TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| they get arrested and they come in and they can have two or three hundred, that one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| two or three hundred thousand dollars' worth of care when they infect their heart valves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| that I've personally been involved with in the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| The state would pay that if they were not arrested and had some alternative as to where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| So I think there's a lot of other implications that we can't come down with a hard dollar figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| on seeing how it's going to be, but this is a very, very expensive proposition to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| And I think the sheriff does a great job running a jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| but he's not doing a very good job running a psychiatric hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| I'm totally in agreement with this conceptually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| but I think there's still a lot of questions about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:56| There's questions about process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| I realize the ten-year plan is a political poison right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:09| We're a community that is about to make a, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:19| somewhere in the range of a $25 million commitment or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| And I agree that this has been studied, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7884)|
| 2:11:31| There's something about the process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| We need to be bigger in the way we look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| because it involves, it potentially involves a lot more, I think, than what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7898)|
| 2:11:47| And so I would just like to slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| and have a thorough examination of the finances and all the possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7912)|
| 2:12:00| I mean, Centerpoint's in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| and I do not understand, although I've heard, that that can't be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:12| I know that there's women being held in this jail now, and we're under 170.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:20| And we've got 220 beds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| I mean, there's multiple opportunities to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| I don't think that they're all viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| but I don't think that we've said we've given adequate reasons yet to disprove them as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:45| So I'm just, I'm not there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| I'm just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| But I do, I mean, on the end of it, I don't see what, where are these people going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7972)|
| 2:13:00| Is permanent sporting housing, is that part of their follow-up at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| I just don't see it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| It's not together yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| I don't see it, or I'm not getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| And so it's just, you know, there's like 12 different reasons for me to not be on board right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:23| And there's just too many questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| That's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| Along the same lines, Tony, you know, Mr. Chairman, I mean, we're your servants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| and I'd like to see maybe consideration of maybe appointing two or whoever's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| this is going to be in their district, I don't know, Amy, if it's your district or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| but definitely whoever's district it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| And maybe appoint one or two other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| just like when these people come back from audit committee and tell us stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| I mean, that means so much to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| You might want to think about appointing a couple of commissioners to sit with Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| and the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| I think they might, you know, welcome you all to sit on the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| and maybe talk to us from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| We already have three commissioners that are part of this committee that's been working on this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:07| Myself, Dr. Briggs, and Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| We've been on this, working on this for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| You know, I think what Larry's saying is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:23| but, you know, the Justice Committee, it really goes back a lot further than just a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| This has been going out where they've been trying to look at a very, very serious way of doing this for about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:36| There's been multiple consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| There's been multiple trips to communities all over the country looking at what they've tried to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:45| I think, were you able to make that last trip, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| We recently had another trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| There's been trips down to San Antonio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| We've had, like I said, this thing has been beat to death in the Justice Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| And I know the, I guess it was about a year and a half ago we were at one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| and the former mayor was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| We had the judges were there, you know, all the involved parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| And, you know, and that same question was raised again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| Can we get another consultant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| Should we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| But, I mean, how many consultants, how many trips, how many things need to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| And it's not, this is not something that's just come up in the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| This has been a five-year ongoing process with the courts, with the attorney general, with the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| with I'm trying to think who else is there, the different community agencies that helps some of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:42| And like I said, there's been, I've got a briefcase here that I can hardly lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| that's got all the consultants' reports that have been done and the different proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:53| I mean, I guess you can always get a, you know, we can always pay another consultant in to come and do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| But I tell you, there's been a lot of effort, a lot of time, and a lot of money spent all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| And I think we either need to decide we're going to do it or not do it and not spend a lot more time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:09| You know, like I said, the federal judge is on board with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| This has been presented to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| The judges have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| The Justice Committee has looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| We're the representatives on the Justice Committee that Amy just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| So the commissioners are Amy and Brad and you, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| Top-notch group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| You know, since this is a workshop, we have open discussion, I'd like to speak to a few things that Commissioner Norman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:37| And I agree, there are some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| When we placed the women downtown in the facility here below us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:48| that was done strategically because that number would never hit the cap, keep the federal government off of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| But in doing that, we've moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| What the problem is, is number one, we shouldn't be housing mentally ill in our jail other than just being mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| And that's really what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| I mean, there's 100 to 120 people up there a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| If they weren't mentally ill, they would not be in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| Or if they were stable under medicine, they would not be in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| And so we're housing them at $200 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| And if we're housing those 120 up there at $200 a day, we can't house bad guys for $90 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| And, you know, there's people, unfortunately there's people in this county, and it's not one person's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:29| It's not one institution's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| It's multiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| It's society's answer that they need to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| There's people walking the streets that don't need to be walking our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| And as long as we're spending a half a million dollars a year on mental health drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| and $200 a day to institute mentally ill people that don't need to be instituted, we're failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:51| And we can either spend $20 million over ten years on a safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| or we can spend $20 million over on a pod and spend $200 a day per person in that pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| It's up to this commission to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| I'm being drawn in here a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Let's talk about beds or bark-a-loungers or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:26| How many, what do we have right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| What's available in terms of the crisis situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:35| How many beds do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| Somebody answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| I'm Andy Black, 201 West Springdale Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| Hi, Andy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:50| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:51| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| The crisis stabilization unit has ten beds and has been in operation since February of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8333)|
| 2:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| And that's over on Centerpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| Now, if this goes through as designed, how many more beds are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:15| We would add 12 beds to those ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| So it would be a total of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| Right now, the ten beds that we have available, what's sort of our average consumption, their use or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:30| Since February of 2009, we've seen close to 1,700 people through those ten beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| But, I mean, on an average, are they all used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| The average daily census is going to be eight plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| And the reason you're able to see so many people, Commissioner, is that they have a brief stay up to three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8394)|
| 2:19:55| With the goal being, the goal of the crisis stabilization unit is to divert people from higher levels of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8395)|
| 2:20:04| and so it's to divert people from a psychiatric hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| And our diversion rate is 95-plus percent on those 1,700-plus people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Now, this new facility will be, if built, over off central, that will be your facility, right, when it's built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| That's part of the loan, which is not a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| It's a loan that we'll pay back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| It's my understanding that a government-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| That's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| And that it's my understanding that using this Section 8 CDBG HUD grant or loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:46| that a government entity can't apply for it nor own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| And so the net increase in beds at the new facility is 12, and we have 10 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8454)|
| 2:21:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| And our operating cost would be 1.7 million a year as the average over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| So that's what we have to commit to before we can-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| In the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| Well, you know, I hate to do math in public either, I mean, also, but this is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:34| When I look at the numbers like what you decided, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| about the expense of maintaining these people at $200 a day, and I'm doing the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:46| it's really pretty close to the operating costs that we've got for this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:54| And so it's almost like a wash, and then Helen Ross McNabb gets the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| We're funding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| Well, see, I would suggest to you that the jail day cost is only one part of the potential cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| The second is you're going to save $750 to $1 million a year in transportation costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| and then there's the cost of the officer time going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:24| And then General Nichols can talk about the criminal justice costs that would be eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:31| because these folks would never hit the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| So that is one aspect of it, but there are multiple additional costs, potential cost savings through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:45| So when these people are finished with their stay, Mr. Black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:52| what's the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| They would say there's someone who has a drug or alcohol problem, they come into this facility, the new facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8575)|
| 2:23:02| then what happens to them after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| What's the next part of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| For the people who go through our crisis stabilization unit, if they have a provider, another provider in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:16| then we hook them back up with a provider that they were using before they came to the CSU, the crisis stabilization unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:25| If they do not have a provider, then we will give them the names of various providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:32| and they can choose whom they want to go and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:36| If that person doesn't have insurance, it becomes more of an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8616)|
| 2:23:43| because it's difficult to find organizations in the community that will take new uninsured patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| We will refer those people internally to our programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| The same sort of process would exist for someone coming in who has a drug or alcohol issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8635)|
| 2:24:03| Then if they're currently seeing someone, we would refer them to the person that they're currently seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:11| If not, then we would find someone else in the community to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| This is just another part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| For me, I'd still feel much more comfortable if we had a couple more months to have a better handle on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:33| There's a disconnect right there at the end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| For me, there's not a proper accommodation of people that may not have a provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:47| I just see them being recycled back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| We're not getting to the root of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| I don't know how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| This is not my domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| It's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| I'd much rather talk about the hillsides or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8699)|
| 2:25:04| That's a good topic to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| But again, conceptually, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| I hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| I think it's wrong to put these folks in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| But I'm just not there yet and I wish we had a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| Mr. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| I think I understand some of Tony's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| I understand what he means about the follow-up care after someone leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| because we've been assured that there aren't going to be any discharges to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| I know that to get into drug and alcohol treatment programs, anything inpatient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:51| there's oftentimes a waiting list of at least a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| So what's going to happen to those people in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| Because we don't want them discharged to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| We don't want them taken to CARM and dropped off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| That's the one part that I'm not confident that we have a good plan in place yet for that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| So I share Tony's concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| The rest of it, I think it's absolutely we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| But I have concerns about the funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| and I have concerns about that discharge, at that point of discharge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| what's going to happen exactly at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| Let me speak to something first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| There's also the component that we missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| In 2009, we had 3,751 at one time arrests for publicly intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:49| This number would be covered there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| So that's 3,700 people at $90 a day at least if they stay one day if they're not mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8812)|
| 2:26:59| So that's another component of that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| Also, it keeps them from losing their insurance, which is the key component to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| because if they don't lose their insurance, then facilities will take them readily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| whereas if they lose their insurance, then we're back to square one again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| and we end up at the hospital at $1,500 a day at taxpayer's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| And that's local taxpayers that are picking up the tab for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| It is, for every time we take one to the hospital, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| Dr. Brees, I think, can speak to that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| But that's a key number and we see that number rising every year of the public intoxicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| And these are only one time public intoxicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| The number drops drastically when you drop to between two and five arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| It drops all the way down to 355 individuals from 3,751.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| And we see, when we realize taking those people out of the facility, the numbers come down tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:51| Mr. Ogilvie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| Maybe Mr. Jones or Sheriff Jones or Mr. Nichols can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8878)|
| 2:28:04| What are the savings going to be for the sheriff's office and the justice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| I know we talked about it when we toured and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| I don't know if anybody came up with any numbers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| And the only fair number I would be able to give you is, and we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8894)|
| 2:28:19| I don't think that I can stand up here and tell you this is going to save $3 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:25| I can stand up here and tell you it's going to save taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| There's absolutely no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| Absolutely no doubt it will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| I think after about 14 to 16 months into it, when you can really get a handle on the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8912)|
| 2:28:37| and compare them to the year before, that's when you're going to realize the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| And I know people like to have a number and you want me to stand up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| and tell you that this is going to save you X millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| I can't do that truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I wouldn't feel comfortable doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| I can feel comfortable by saying there's no way that this cannot save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| There's no way it cannot save money and not save bed space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| Ultimately, in the next couple of years, if we don't do this, these are the only two options we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| We have to have some kind of diversion option or we have to build a pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| And when the federal judge orders us to build a pod at $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| and another $2 million or $3 million for maintenance and employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| because as I said before, we've not had a new employee since 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| and I've added 300 beds just since I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| And those beds are full now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| So when the federal judge says you're going to build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| you're going to have to come up with $22 million like now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| So there are options for diversion or options to build more jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| And to me, those are the only two options we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| I mean, I like the concept of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| I like that, for one, the insurance purposes of allowing them to save their insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| and being able to file that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| My question is kind of my concern, I guess, is the same as Tony's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| is where's the funding going to come from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| That's the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| Yeah, we can look at savings, and we're going to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| Have we looked at other, not nothing against Helen Ross McNabb, but Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| I mean, they have plenty of beds over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| Lakeshore is almost nonexistent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| We've gone from 2,000 beds down to less than 100 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| There's just no space over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| It's, you know, the state agencies have just said we're not going to take them anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9021)|
| 2:30:27| and so they're left for us to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| I just worry about where the money is going to come from is my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| And in that regard, Commissioner, you know, the truth is you're paying for it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9033)|
| 2:30:39| At 1103 this morning at the detention facility, at 8 o'clock count this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:46| you are paying for these people now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| They're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| The question is, do you want to pay some less for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| To me, that's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| Do I want to devise a plan that I can do the same thing I'm doing now, perchance with some more humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| but can I do it cheaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| And we're here saying, yes, sir, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| And we think this concept works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| I, too, share, you know, we all want to know what's exactly going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| And we can't tell you precisely because this is somewhat novel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9080)|
| 2:31:27| There's no place to go look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| There's no study to go look at and say, how did this work in San Antonio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:35| How did it work in Akron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| And that's the problem that we, too, have because we're feeding along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:44| But based on our experience and 3,700 drunks just last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:49| and around 300 people suffering from mental illness locked up as we speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:57| I think we can do it some cheaper and add that dose of humanity to it to ease the pain of a lot of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9117)|
| 2:32:05| And that's why we urge you to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9125)|
| 2:32:10| As somebody said a while ago, you know, we can always stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| If there becomes some controversy that we can't resolve or you're not satisfied with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| all we're asking you to do is to vote to go forward and ask HUD, will you loan us this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:29| They may say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| I guess that ends it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| That's what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| And we'll be here and we'll be at your disposal to help try to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| and to adopt your ideas on what we need to do to make it work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| But if the expense is here today as it is, you are not incurring any more expense by moving forward on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:55| And more delay does not help us as we see it, based on the almost five years of work we've got into it presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9175)|
| 2:33:07| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| The resolution that's before us is to exhaustively study potential funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| I'd like to see that moved to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| And let's go on to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| Mr. Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| I was going to remind J.J. and Mr. Nichols that at the workshop last week you did say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:32| and we're savvy enough to understand that there's going to be fluctuations and nothing is exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| but that you would get some numbers together for us, not just for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| but to give to our constituents who have those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| And I also want to mention that our workshop that we had at the detention facility is on YouTube now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9224)|
| 2:33:50| So anyone who has questions about what happened there during that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| you can go to YouTube and see the whole thing that the commissioner saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| It was very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| I just have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| Do we have someone here that's part of the, one of the consultants that was employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9249)|
| 2:34:17| Do we have a consultant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| Thanks, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| Would you introduce him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| This is Grant Rosenberg, Director of Community Development, 400 Main Street, Suite 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| Charlie Blair is here on behalf of our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| We contracted with him to review the proposal as it was proposed, review the proposal for Section 108 eligibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9274)|
| 2:34:42| And he wasn't able to be at the workshop last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9282)|
| 2:34:46| but I briefed you all on some of the issues we had related to the proposal and the 108 funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9286)|
| 2:34:52| the first being the eligibility concerns, which Charlie has reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| and he can talk a little more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| And the other one was the funding revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| But I'll introduce Charlie Blair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| Name and address again for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| Charlie Blair, Community Development Services, 2215 Canterbury Circle, Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:12| Thank you, Mr. Blair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9312)|
| 2:35:13| Why don't you take the first one, the eligibility issue first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| Just let us have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| The project as conceived isn't eligible for the Section 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| It's just not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| And the simple way to deal with it is that in Section 57207 of the CDBG regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:36| it basically says that buildings or portions thereof used for the general conduct of government cannot be eligible, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9336)|
| 2:35:48| Do you believe it's the general conduct of government to take care of the mentally ill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| Well, the problem you have is that you have to explain it some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| And so let's talk about what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| The proposal is to divert people from incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9361)|
| 2:36:07| The payer is the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| So where is the use different from government use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| Does everybody follow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| Well, if they're on TennCare, the payer is the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| I mean, so it's, you know, just because somebody's on TennCare, this fails to qualify us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9380)|
| 2:36:27| No, if this is being paid for entirely with insurance, that would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| TennCare is federal insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| So if it's TennCare insurance and we're paying for it, then it's not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9393)|
| 2:36:41| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| What I'm saying is that the problem is that there are two things going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9403)|
| 2:36:48| and I need to clarify that there are two things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9408)|
| 2:36:51| One is it isn't eligible because it's a building that's being built for public use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| for government use, to further the purposes of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| The sole purpose of the building is to divert people from jail, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| Right? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| So in that sense, it's just not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| Does everybody follow that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| The rule is real clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| This isn't a question about whether or not we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| It's simply ineligible use of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| That's not to say that this isn't a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:30| It's a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| So that's one aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| The second aspect is how could you pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| You literally could pay for it out of tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:41| but you can't really borrow from the federal government to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9461)|
| 2:37:49| I don't know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| I'm sorry, I'm Charlie Blair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| No, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| Are you a government attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9474)|
| 2:37:55| No, I'm not a government attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| I've been doing this for, in fact, I started here in Knoxville about 18 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| I primarily work with federal programs all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| I work primarily with HOME, CDBG, and NSP, three of the major programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9487)|
| 2:38:12| as well as the homeless programs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9492)|
| 2:38:16| So I have a broad general knowledge of each of these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| and certifications from HUD and at least the HOME program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:27| So, Mr. Blair, I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| Given where we are in the process, what is your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| I would send it to the Justice Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| and I think that everyone has asked the pertinent questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| You need to figure out what the revenue stream is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| If it, in fact, is TennCare, and that's a portion of it, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:52| But you need to list it and show how you're going to get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| and you need to show what the cost savings are on the sheriff's side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| because you've got a balance that you've got to achieve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| The bottom line, as it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| is you're being asked to come out $20 million one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:11| One is a capital expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| One is an ongoing year-to-year expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| So you're going to spend the $20 million each way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| The question becomes, what's the operating expense over time for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| And I happen to think this is a brilliant idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| I can tell you from personal experience across the country that the idea itself is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9564)|
| 2:39:30| It's solid. It meets all the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| It's not the idea that I'm saying is ineligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| What I'm saying is ineligible is the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| It's just simply not appropriate to this type of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| So the resolution that's before you is to send it to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| for a full vetting of all the funding sources, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| I think that resolution is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| That's what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9594)|
| 2:39:55| You need to come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| But I don't think it's going to work with CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| That's Section 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| There are other ways to make it work with CDBG, but not with Section 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:09| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| I'm sorry, were you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:14| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9614)|
| 2:40:15| You know, a lot of these things, you know, we really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| See, what we're really trying to do with this today is to be able to submit the application to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:25| Because if HUD rejects this, which you're saying they may or they may not do, your opinion is they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| I think that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9630)|
| 2:40:31| I don't think they'll reject it here locally, but they will in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| Well, ultimately, I mean, before you get the money or you can go through with this to obtain the capital funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| that's ultimately going to be HUD's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| And it really doesn't matter what I think or you think or anyone else thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| Your opinion is that they'll reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| And, you know, what I suggest that we do, because, like I said, we can study this another five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| I mean, we've already got a lot of time and, you know, time behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| And I think we've already heard the sheriff and the attorney general say we don't know exactly how much this is going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| until we actually, you know, get further along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| What I still think we need to do is either to, because really all we're voting on, on what, at least what I'm proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9669)|
| 2:41:16| it's not exactly what's in this resolution, but all we're voting on is to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| because this is what the federal government requires, if you have a situation like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9682)|
| 2:41:28| and I think we all agree it cannot be owned by the county, it cannot be run by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| and still be eligible for the Section 108, everybody agrees on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| Let's look at what we agree on and what we disagree on and what we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| We all agree that the county cannot run this using Section 108 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9700)|
| 2:41:45| Everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| What we don't know is exactly where the funding is all going to come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:53| and I don't think there's going to be any way we're going to know that completely ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| What I think we need to vote on when we actually vote on this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| and this is, you know, what I would like to do, and I think it's the same thing that the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| and Commissioner Andrews and some of the others have said, is let's vote to go ahead, let's go forward on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| let's submit the application to HUD, and rather than us deciding whether it's eligible or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| or, you know, the opinion here of whether it's eligible or not, let HUD decide whether it's eligible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| This process is going to take a couple of years before we're ready to admit patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:30| It will probably be six months to a year before we hear back from HUD is my understanding on how long these things take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:37| It doesn't commit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| A vote now to just say that we'll support this does not commit us to $20 million over the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:48| But it does if we go through, if HUD approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:53| No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| No, what can happen, we can look at this as we go forward, and I think that's really a good point you bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| because I think that's something that's not well understood by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| It does not commit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| If HUD says, yes, go ahead, here are the capital funds, because you're borrowing against other CDBG funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9787)|
| 2:43:15| we can still say after we look at this over the next year or two, we can say, well, you know, maybe there's a better alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9795)|
| 2:43:21| Then all we do is say we won't take the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9801)|
| 2:43:25| It doesn't commit us to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| And, of course, if HUD rejects it, we're back to the drawing board on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| And, you know, I think, you know, I don't mean to say, but, you know, we've been dragging our feet for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| I mean, I sat there at that committee and people said, how much longer are we going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| I mean, I think it's time to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| But it's not, again, it's not an irrevocable step that we're taking where we still can't step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:49| All we're going to do is see, all we're really doing is we're asking HUD, would you accept this or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9829)|
| 2:43:55| And I respect very much what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| You may be absolutely right and you probably are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| But let's let HUD decide rather than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| They may decide that it's a worthy project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| I want to make sure I understood what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:13| You said you thought this was a, quote, brilliant idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| Did I hear you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| I mean, seriously, because I want to get your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:20| This problem is going on all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| Not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9863)|
| 2:44:24| And this is the first time that my colleague and I, John Cain, who worked on this together, this is the first time we've seen a solution that makes sense, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:33| It's just you've got the wrong funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| And that's our only problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| I mean, in our viewpoint, if you're going to do this out of tax dollars and you're going to build this facility out of tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9877)|
| 2:44:45| and then you're going to operate it with TennCare, the other instruments that are available, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| We don't see any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| You can actually use some of your program activity money, your activity money with CDBG, to fund the LMI people, the low and moderate income folks that go through this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9891)|
| 2:45:02| But you don't have enough of that to fund all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| So that's one problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| You only have 15 percent of CDBG is allowed for those public services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| You don't have enough money to fully fund it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| So you really have to have a source for this building to get the building up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9916)|
| 2:45:23| And then it looks like, on paper, and subject to a whole bunch of check it out, do the feasibility on it, that this thing would run based on TennCare, based on private insurance, based on the fact you'd be able to find people who chose diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:40| There are a list of revenue streams available for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| So you're basically talking about a one and a half million dollar investment to build a building that just cannot be CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9943)|
| 2:45:53| Find another source of money for it and you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| Pay for it out of county tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9958)|
| 2:45:59| You even have a way to potentially support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| But, yeah, my personal opinion, professional opinion, the opinion of my colleague John Cain, both of us, is this brilliant idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9962)|
| 2:46:09| It hits the mark in a number of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| It just isn't CDBG 108 eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| That's our only beef.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9976)|
| 2:46:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| I'm coming at it from a totally different point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| And I guess it's just an encouragement to my commissioners that have constituents outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9981)|
| 2:46:29| I know we all received an e-mail letter attachment from Barbara Kelly with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| I'd ask that you all poll your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| Talk with the people out there who maybe have taken these grants for roof repair and these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=9997)|
| 2:46:45| This money will be diverted from that program to see if this is going to be a major impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10005)|
| 2:46:52| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10015)|
| 2:46:56| I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| But I just want to make sure that, I guess, and that large commissioners as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| if you guys will, again, ask your constituents out there if this is something that they're understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10022)|
| 2:47:14| that this comes at a cost and that cost is, if successful, that cost will be to that block grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10034)|
| 2:47:23| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| Commissioner, you had asked that this be put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| My feeling is that this should not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| So, unless someone disagrees, I think that we'll move forward and not put this on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10051)|
| 2:47:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| Any other further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Health Department, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| We've got three items for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| Let's begin with item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| It's resolution R-10-9-601,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| approving a contract with Cherokee Health Systems for a primary care provider for children on TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10068)|
| 2:47:53| covered kids or those without insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10073)|
| 2:47:59| Would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Damard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:06| I would just entertain any questions commissioners might have regarding this contract for pediatric primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10086)|
| 2:48:13| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| I went out and met with Martha at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| We looked at it and appreciate the tour there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| Had some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| Martha, you want to tell us, just give us some brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| You're saying it's going to save $300,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| I think the important parts of this contract or arrangement with Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| the kids are going to continue to get the care they already get with possibly increased access to psychiatric services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10117)|
| 2:48:44| through TennCare's integrated care model where they place psychiatric care in the primary care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| Certainly these kids and their families need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:53| It's going to save the county approximately $300,000 initially in cost for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10133)|
| 2:49:01| and other costs of running our current pediatric clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| And there will be no health department staff, none of them will lose their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| they'll become Cherokee employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| And we'll continue to have health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:16| Cherokee is going to grandfather those folks in so they have health insurance immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| They'll be able to carry over any FMLA they might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| They'll be recognized and start accruing leave at the rate another Cherokee employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:29| who's been with them for 20 years would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| And you also have some concerns have been asked about the cost to the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10172)|
| 2:49:38| as far as contributions for premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| And there's a little handout that I put together, a table in coordination with our HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10180)|
| 2:49:45| and Cherokee's HR department to demonstrate that actually four of those seven employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| will pay less for their premiums over an entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| And only three of them will have a negative impact on their premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| And that's spread over the entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| And the maximum there, as you can see, is $442 spread over the entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10198)|
| 2:50:04| So really trying hard to do minimal impact on the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| make sure these kids keep getting the services they get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| and at a savings of $300,000 for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10211)|
| 2:50:17| Joel Hornberger and Jeff Howard are here from Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| If anybody has questions for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| This is just for some thanking points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| And Martha was very helpful with the tour and stuff that we took over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10227)|
| 2:50:33| Commissioners, here's what I'm looking at with this and for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| It's going to save us $300,000, but in that savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| the square footage of the building itself you told me was how big?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10242)|
| 2:50:45| Our health department is how large?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| Gary, do you remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| About 127,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| The clinic itself is about 6,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| What I'm going to preface this by saying is Knox County owns the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| The taxpayers own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| And here's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10264)|
| 2:51:05| We're giving away, commissioners, we're giving away 6,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| and I'm saying this because I own commercial property myself and I know what it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| I mean, we're giving this away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| We're giving 6,000 square feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| Martha, who's going to pay the KUB bill for that each month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| Who's going to, are they set up with internet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| Does Knox County pick up the internet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| Does Knox County pay for the cleaning service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| I mean, I'm sure we have cleaning service every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| We continue to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| Who replaces the heat and air if the heat and air goes out in that unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| Who pays for the light bulbs and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| I mean, we're, we've got a huge building over there and you're giving a piece of it to Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| which I agree with what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| but then is that going to open the door for somebody else to come over here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| hey, Knox County gave them some, let's see if we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| and we're going to be eating away at our bill that the taxpayers are paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10315)|
| 2:51:59| So if you can make me feel better about that, I mean, how Knox County's, who's going to pay those costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:05| Well, first of all, as far as, excuse me, internet costs, telephone, those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10325)|
| 2:52:11| Cherokee will be taking care of all those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| They'll be putting in the necessary stuff for them to be able to do their electronic health record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10334)|
| 2:52:20| since they are electronic health record based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10340)|
| 2:52:24| So we already have to do that and they'll be doing that and take on that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| If there's any operational costs, replacement of say an exam table breaks or something like that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| they'll be replacing those at their cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| And Joel and I have talked about this and certainly are open to looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10357)|
| 2:52:41| as we look at revenue and how the clinic runs to consider cost sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10361)|
| 2:52:48| and then picking up some of those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| They are open to that discussion and that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| They want to take care of these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| They want to step in and do this and they want to work with us to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10375)|
| 2:52:59| Well, you know, I think these need to be ironed out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10379)|
| 2:53:03| I mean, 6,000 square feet of utility bill is going to be pretty expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| And if the heat and air unit goes out, who pays for that heat and air unit because they're very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| We only have one big, we kind of have a really big unit that's outside the building that's for the whole facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10392)|
| 2:53:20| They're not individualized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| But is anybody here from PBA that can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:26| I don't believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10406)|
| 2:53:27| We can have somebody from PBA there on Monday if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| I don't have anybody here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| To address the specific cost of, you know, the 6,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| how do you break that out in a 127,000 square foot building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10415)|
| 2:53:40| As far as the Diabetes Association, they may want to come in and take a piece of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| or the Alzheimer's people, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:45| I'm just concerned about the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| I think we certainly have control over being able to, you know, set some limits on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10427)|
| 2:53:52| But, again, Cherokee's open to discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10435)|
| 2:53:56| I mean, I see what you're trying to do with that with Cherokee and do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10436)|
| 2:53:59| but I'm just concerned commissioners is what the precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| I want to back up to the employees for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| This contract is year to year for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10449)|
| 2:54:14| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| If at the end of any one period Cherokee backs out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| or if at the end of the five-year period they do not seek to be the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10460)|
| 2:54:28| And I think they're the only person, they're the only organization bidding at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10468)|
| 2:54:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| There were actually two RFPs issued for this particular contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| The first one went out and we did not have bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| There was some miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| The second one went out and Cherokee was the only bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10484)|
| 2:54:48| East Tennessee Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| and other providers in the community of pediatric care were informed of the RFPs but chose not to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| So if Cherokee were to back out of the agreement through whatever legal way they might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10497)|
| 2:55:03| would these current county employees be considered to be back as county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10503)|
| 2:55:09| if the county had to take the service back over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| I think we'd have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:13| The contract reads they have to give us a 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10513)|
| 2:55:17| I think it'd have to be really busy 30 days for me to try to figure out what to do with these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10517)|
| 2:55:25| They will be totally Cherokee's employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| And if Cherokee is not providing the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| if it were deemed necessary for the county to take that back over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| certainly keeping employees that we already know and are familiar with the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| would be in the best interest of the clinic and of the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10537)|
| 2:55:41| So if that were to happen, I think we'd have to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10541)|
| 2:55:46| Mr. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| I have some questions, too, about the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:57| There will no longer be county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| There are going to be employees with Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10562)|
| 2:56:03| And their compensation is going to be the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| And retirement and sick leave and all that is going to be accrued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:14| As every other Cherokee employee, as you know, the way our retirement works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10574)|
| 2:56:20| they'll be able to take that and do with what they have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10580)|
| 2:56:24| It's theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| Most of these employees are already vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| so what they've put into their retirement plans is theirs, and they'll be able to take that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| I cannot speak to Cherokee's retirement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| Joel or Jeff possibly could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10595)|
| 2:56:39| They will be able to start accruing leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| Cherokee doesn't have annual leave and sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| They just have paid time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| So say one of our employees has been with us 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| When they go to Cherokee, they'll begin accruing leave at the same rate as one of their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| that's been with them for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| So they don't have to build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10615)|
| 2:56:56| You know, when you first start a job, you eke up a little bit of leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| The other thing that the county has agreed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| we have to pay them their annual leave because they will no longer be our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| So we can either pay Cherokee so that they'll have a little pool to draw from in case a kid gets sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10627)|
| 2:57:13| or they, you know, have a problem, can't come to work or need to take a day off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| So they'll have that pool to draw from over time until they delete that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| Or they can be paid for that in cash, a check, if that's what they choose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10641)|
| 2:57:26| That will be the employee's choosing, and each individual employee will have the option to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| Cherokee's agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| The county has agreed to work that out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| So that way they can go over there with some leave to draw from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:39| because unexpected things do happen, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10659)|
| 2:57:42| What about, my understanding is that Cherokee's policy is to only guarantee any employee only three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10662)|
| 2:57:50| at any location that after three months is up, they can be reassigned somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10670)|
| 2:57:56| I'll let Joel Hornberger, CEO of Cherokee, speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10676)|
| 2:58:03| Hi, I'm Joel Hornberger, 2848 Good Hope Church Road, Newmarket, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| And would you repeat your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| Right now Cherokee said that the people who are county employees right now working that clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10691)|
| 2:58:17| will become Cherokee employees and you're going to keep them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:21| Is there any guarantee how long they're going to be kept there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| Are they going to be kept there as long as they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| or after three months can Cherokee put them somewhere else if they decide they need them somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10706)|
| 2:58:32| Or are they promised to stay there for as long as they want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| Well, a lot of those people have been there for decades and they want to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| And I'm concerned that you say now you're going to keep them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| but what about in three months or six months if you decide to restructure it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| or you need them somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| I mean, how is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| Do they have any guarantees or any assurances beyond that first three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10733)|
| 2:58:59| We really value those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| We've heard a lot about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| We have a physician, actually two physicians who are current Cherokee employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:09| pediatricians who've worked with those people in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| and they tell us just the best things about these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| And so it's just like any other business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| If you have really great employees at a place, you're not going to transfer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| You're not going to move them somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| You're going to build that business with those best employees, and that's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10767)|
| 2:59:33| But you're not going to give them any kind of guarantee then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10773)|
| 2:59:37| There are no contracts with Cherokee employees at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10777)|
| 2:59:41| I don't have a contract as a COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| Our CEO doesn't have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| There are no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| There are no contracts with any employees at Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10789)|
| 2:59:50| Because I do, I am concerned about that one particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| If they stayed with the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| I don't think they would be worried about in three months' time that the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10797)|
| 3:00:01| might move them somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| And I think that is a concern with an organization as large and as diverse as Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| I think that is a real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| I'm the CEO, if you don't care, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| I'm sorry, sir, I didn't get your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| Joel Hornberger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| Mr. Hornberger, the county is allegedly saving $300,000 on this contract, and they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10825)|
| 3:00:32| by giving up the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10832)|
| 3:00:37| Are we charging you rent at Dameron Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10840)|
| 3:00:41| Are we charging you rent at Hardy Building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10844)|
| 3:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10845)|
| 3:00:46| And if I could just explain that, it's not that we negotiated that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10849)|
| 3:00:50| We responded to an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10850)|
| 3:00:51| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10851)|
| 3:00:52| That was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10852)|
| 3:00:53| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10853)|
| 3:00:54| My point being, I'm concerned about those employees too, and I don't think you're going to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10854)|
| 3:00:59| I really don't think that you, how can there be a $300,000 difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10859)|
| 3:01:05| I don't understand why you can make money on it and the health department can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| I might be able to explain that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| If you look around the way TennCare pays, I think 98% of the children that are served there are TennCare children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10872)|
| 3:01:21| And the reason that there are not a lot of providers in the community that really want to serve TennCare children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10881)|
| 3:01:32| is because TennCare pays a pretty low rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| Cherokee is in a very fortunate position where we're able to access federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10896)|
| 3:01:43| and so we receive those TennCare dollars, but if our costs are higher than those TennCare dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:51| we get extra money, and it's called prospective payment system, PPS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10911)|
| 3:01:57| and that allows us to draw down federal dollars to support this, and that's how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10917)|
| 3:02:04| Prospective payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| Prospective payment system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| And our CFO, Jeff Howard, is here, and he's really an expert in this if he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10928)|
| 3:02:12| Well, I just, I mean, you would think that we would have those funds too if we're the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10932)|
| 3:02:18| It's interesting that you bring that up, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| Several years ago when we applied, you know, you've seen our building out here, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10941)|
| 3:02:28| Knoxville was the only major metropolitan community in Tennessee that was not drawing down any federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10948)|
| 3:02:35| Chattanooga was, Nashville was, Memphis was, Tri-Cities was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:40| Knoxville was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10960)|
| 3:02:42| So we went to Atlanta to meet with the Department of Health and Human Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| and said to them, why is this the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| And they said, well, nobody's ever applied, and if you apply, we'll grant that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10969)|
| 3:02:56| And so we were just asking those questions to draw down these federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| A government would not be allowed to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| It has to be what's called a federally qualified health center, an FQHC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10985)|
| 3:03:10| and there are certain governance requirements such as we have where at least 51% of our board of directors has to be our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=10990)|
| 3:03:21| And so a lot of times hospitals have difficulty with that, so a lot of hospitals don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11001)|
| 3:03:27| Governments don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11007)|
| 3:03:28| It's mostly not-for-profit 501C3 organizations that have that flexibility in terms of governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11008)|
| 3:03:36| So you're not going to, I'm concerned, and I don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11016)|
| 3:03:41| I think the private sector can do some things better than the government can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11021)|
| 3:03:47| but I'm concerned with the fact that I don't think you're going to keep the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| I don't say you can make up a $300,000 difference and keep all the employees at the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11030)|
| 3:03:56| There's no way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11036)|
| 3:03:59| Jeff, would you like to address just the financial piece of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11039)|
| 3:04:04| With all due respect, Commissioner, I would disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| We have 21 clinics throughout East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| We've been doing this for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11052)|
| 3:04:15| As an FQHC, though, only since the mid-'80s, but even then we've been able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11055)|
| 3:04:26| and our intent would be to keep those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11066)|
| 3:04:29| Now, when you say that we don't think we're going to keep the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| what my concern was when you said that was do you have information that they're going to quit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11077)|
| 3:04:38| Because I don't want them to quit because that's not our intent at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| Like I said before to Commissioner Broyles, we've only heard really great things about these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11081)|
| 3:04:46| and it's our intent to treat them right, to treat them fairly, to keep them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| to make this business grow, and to serve more children in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| And we think that doing a collaboration with the county in this way will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11094)|
| 3:05:00| But Jeff Howard here is our CFO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| and he can tell you a little bit more about the financial structure of how we're going to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:10| Jeff Howard, CFO for Cherokee Health Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| The address there is 2018 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11112)|
| 3:05:17| With regard to the prospective payment system and TennCare, that really is one of our best payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11117)|
| 3:05:24| And whereas a lot of providers will be limited on what they can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11124)|
| 3:05:29| in some places I've heard $0.27 on the dollar, with prospective payment system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11129)|
| 3:05:35| there is a substantial amount of money available that comes from the state, the Department of TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11135)|
| 3:05:40| as a cost reimbursement, a cost settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| And so, again, that is one of our best payers because of our federally qualified health center status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11144)|
| 3:05:52| So you get money from the state because you are that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11152)|
| 3:05:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| But the county can't get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| That makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11163)|
| 3:06:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11168)|
| 3:06:09| Brad, back to yours, talking about how can they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| You know, folks, they're getting free rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| They're getting free rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11175)|
| 3:06:16| They're getting free utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11176)|
| 3:06:17| If they had to go out and build a 6,000 square foot building of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11177)|
| 3:06:22| think of what they'd be paying on property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| Cherokee, do you pay property tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11190)|
| 3:06:31| We're not for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11191)|
| 3:06:32| You'd be paying utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:33| You'd be paying your cleaning services and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| You'd have a lot of overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| I guess this is my question to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| I see Michael back here with the mayor's office and Ann Acuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| Ann, I see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11203)|
| 3:06:44| For my peace of mind at the meeting Monday, could you check with the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11204)|
| 3:06:49| make sure that the mayor is on board with this and knowing what we're fixing to give away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11209)|
| 3:06:55| what Knox County is fixing to give away to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11215)|
| 3:06:58| If he's happy with it and he's fine with that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:01| I want to hear from the mayor's office what they feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11221)|
| 3:07:07| I just think we're giving an awful lot away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11227)|
| 3:07:11| And it's nothing against the kids, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| I just wanted to be sure, is this like a professional services contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11237)|
| 3:07:21| where we're providing the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| Do they do the billing or do we do the billing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| They'll do the billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11245)|
| 3:07:26| I wasn't sure who you were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| They'll do all the billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| They'll do all the administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| They'll take over management of the clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| They'll also be having to hire a physician since Dr. Washer is retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| And so they'll be staffing and taking care of the supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11260)|
| 3:07:45| and all of the other things, scheduling, the infrastructure for the computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| electronic health records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| And we think this is saving us $300,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| So what we're giving away is $300,000 of expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11276)|
| 3:08:03| What we're giving away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| No, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11285)|
| 3:08:06| We've said here we're giving away something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| What we're giving away is $300,000 of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11288)|
| 3:08:11| Actually, the $300,000 does not count the cost, the PVA cost of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11291)|
| 3:08:19| The $300,000 is the cost of staff and supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11299)|
| 3:08:25| minus the small amount of TennCare revenue that's generated through the clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11305)|
| 3:08:30| So then you're left with $300,000 that if you add back in the physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| and an office manager, we're closer to $500,000 as far as the cost of operating this clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11314)|
| 3:08:43| which you could look at it one way, that basically we're supplementing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| Knox County is supplementing TennCare through this clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| So instead we'll let the feds supplement TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11330)|
| 3:08:54| Mr. Walby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| We met earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11339)|
| 3:09:04| I told you my concern was the staff, but my major concern is the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11344)|
| 3:09:11| Because these staff, as Amy was pointing out, if Cherokee gets rid of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11351)|
| 3:09:16| these children are used to these caregivers that are taking care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| And that's my main concern is what's going to happen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| And then now Chairman Smith brings up the point of we're giving away a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11365)|
| 3:09:33| So, I mean, I have more concerns now, and I'm just concerned about this now as far as the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11373)|
| 3:09:45| If this does fall through five years from now, they back out of it or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11385)|
| 3:09:49| these employees have lost everything they invested in the county to go to Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11389)|
| 3:09:54| and now they can't come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| So, without starting all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11396)|
| 3:09:58| And that's my concern right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| This is certainly not Cherokee's intent or our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11400)|
| 3:10:04| Cherokee has a long record of having medical practices here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11404)|
| 3:10:09| We actually have a track record of having assumed operations for primary care clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11409)|
| 3:10:15| and not firing staff, not getting rid of staff, keeping staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11415)|
| 3:10:19| So that certainly is their history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11419)|
| 3:10:23| And we have a pretty long history of working with Cherokee way before any contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:31| where they provided psychiatric care on site for the indigent care program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| when we had the indigent care program at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11435)|
| 3:10:38| So they have a record of serving those least among us and also doing right by the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:48| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11451)|
| 3:10:52| I also have a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| This is the complaint that I have had about Cherokee that I've heard over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11454)|
| 3:11:01| and that I also have some personal experience with because I've been a patient Cherokee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11461)|
| 3:11:05| and my kids have been patients at Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11465)|
| 3:11:09| And that's that there aren't enough care providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| and the wait can be the least amount I think I've ever been asked to wait for an appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11473)|
| 3:11:20| was at least two weeks, sometimes two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11480)|
| 3:11:24| And a lot of the kids that go to the health department are kids who have been kicked out of other practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11484)|
| 3:11:32| because of missing appointments or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11492)|
| 3:11:37| But when they call the health department, they're able to get in pretty quickly and be cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11497)|
| 3:11:44| And I have a real problem with the long wait times at Cherokee facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11504)|
| 3:11:49| And I'm concerned about that in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11509)|
| 3:11:53| that a clinic that has a great reputation for taking problem patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11513)|
| 3:11:57| and for getting them care quickly will now be part of a system where you have to wait a long time to get care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11517)|
| 3:12:04| and the adults who are in charge of getting care for the kids are not as responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11524)|
| 3:12:08| or reliable as we would like them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11528)|
| 3:12:16| Tricia, you raise a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| And in the past we've had trouble with what happened at this clinic right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11539)|
| 3:12:25| Did you go to the Western Avenue office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| What happened at the Western Avenue office is we built that fairly large building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11547)|
| 3:12:32| 20,000 square feet of clinical space on the second floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11552)|
| 3:12:37| and another 20,000 square feet, almost 20,000 square feet on the third floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11557)|
| 3:12:42| And we had plans to gradually increase the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11562)|
| 3:12:49| What happened shortly after we got into the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11569)|
| 3:12:53| I guess, Jeff, do you know how long it was until the health department approached us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11573)|
| 3:12:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| Within about six months to a year, the health department approached us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11579)|
| 3:13:06| would you all be interested in having a subcontract to you for the adult care there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11586)|
| 3:13:11| As you know, in the past there was a primary care clinic on that first floor at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:18| And we looked at that and we thought that this was something that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11598)|
| 3:13:23| And I have to take blame for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| I'm the CIO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11605)|
| 3:13:26| I severely underestimated how many resources it would take to provide care for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11606)|
| 3:13:36| It was a lot more than I realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11616)|
| 3:13:40| In the past you could have a ratio of one physician maybe to 1,500 or 2,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11620)|
| 3:13:51| And so we were kind of estimating that that would be the ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| It was much more intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| The patients had much greater needs than we realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11636)|
| 3:14:03| And so it's very difficult to recruit providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11643)|
| 3:14:08| That's why I don't want to lose anybody over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| But it's very difficult to recruit providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| There's a primary care physician shortage in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| Physician extenders, nurse practitioners and physician assistants are also increasingly difficult to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11657)|
| 3:14:27| Pay is going through the roof on a lot of these specialties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11667)|
| 3:14:32| And so it took us some time, but we are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| We've increased capacity tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| And we have one clinic today, well not today, but we've had it for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11679)|
| 3:14:46| where we have a physician who just does same-day sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| So if somebody is sick, they come in on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| And they can just call in that morning and come in to see that provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11694)|
| 3:14:59| We also have same-day sick slots for all of our other providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11699)|
| 3:15:03| I believe we have nine full-time providers there now just on the primary care side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11703)|
| 3:15:08| We also have quite a few behaviorists in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11708)|
| 3:15:14| But you raise a good point, and I think we've addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11714)|
| 3:15:17| Have we addressed it to the point where I would like it to be? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| But the other thing to remember, Commissioner, is with the practice there at the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11721)|
| 3:15:30| we don't want to make any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| We don't want to cut staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| In fact, we're going to put a pediatrician in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11734)|
| 3:15:38| I've had three internal candidates ask me for that job, current pediatricians who want to transfer to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11738)|
| 3:15:44| So we'll be able to move very quickly to get a pediatrician in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11744)|
| 3:15:49| But we're not going to change anything at all as far as staffing goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11749)|
| 3:15:54| So as long as the demand remains fairly consistent, the supply of providers should be the same, or will be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11754)|
| 3:16:02| So you're not going to be changing the way the clinic is run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| You're going to let them continue to run it the way that they've always run it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11765)|
| 3:16:08| The only difference that I see that's going to be a major difference, and I'll be honest with everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11768)|
| 3:16:12| is that we have electronic health records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| And so they're going to have to learn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| And that can slow people down until they get the hang of that computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11777)|
| 3:16:21| That's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| And I appreciate that you feel like you've made great strides in wait times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11782)|
| 3:16:26| but I can tell you that just last week I called to try to get an appointment for my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11786)|
| 3:16:31| to follow up with someone that she had seen a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11791)|
| 3:16:35| And it's a two-month wait to get her seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11795)|
| 3:16:41| And I asked if I could be put on a cancellation list so that if someone canceled, they could move us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:49| And I was told they don't keep a cancellation list and that if I was interested in trying to get a spot like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11809)|
| 3:16:54| I would need to get up every morning and call Cherokee Health System every single morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11814)|
| 3:16:59| and ask if there was a cancellation that day that I could bring my daughter in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11819)|
| 3:17:03| So I don't feel like, you know, from someone who is accessing the services at Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11823)|
| 3:17:10| I don't see an improvement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| And I'm concerned about these kids that come to the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11833)|
| 3:17:18| because they're kids that get kicked out of other practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11838)|
| 3:17:24| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| My sense is this will not be a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| So number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| 27 is resolution R-10-9-604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11851)|
| 3:17:34| It's approving the Delta Dental Provider Service Agreement for Tendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11854)|
| 3:17:39| Any questions for Dr. Buchanan on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11859)|
| 3:17:46| Move this to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11866)|
| 3:17:49| Also, if we could do item number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| I believe that's the only, well, we have two more after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| But item number 37, which is an ordinance regarding the health department, if we could move to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11874)|
| 3:18:00| That's Ordinance O-10-8-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| It's to repeal and replace Chapter 22, Article 3 of the Knox County Code relative to emergency medical service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:10| This amends Ordinance O-92-1-102, adopted April 27, 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11890)|
| 3:18:17| O-92-11-102, adopted January 25, 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11897)|
| 3:18:22| Ordinance O-97-1-101, adopted February 24, 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11902)|
| 3:18:28| And Ordinance O-98-12-104, adopted December 21, 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11908)|
| 3:18:33| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| Any questions for Dr. Buchanan about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| Okay, doctor, you had asked for two items to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| If you would tell us the first item to be added and if you would give us the caption again so we can write that down up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11922)|
| 3:18:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11928)|
| 3:18:49| The first item that needs to be added is for emergency dental services to uninsured adults ages 19 to 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11929)|
| 3:18:56| It's a contract with the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11936)|
| 3:18:59| It's granted money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| It's an ongoing program that we've had for several years, which actually began in July of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11941)|
| 3:19:08| And the second item to be added is a contract, a granted program to provide HIV AIDS care from the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11948)|
| 3:19:19| Again, an ongoing program with currently enrolled patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| Can we put these on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| These are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11969)|
| 3:19:32| Item number 28, and, Doug Battelle, if you would make your way to the podium while she reads that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11972)|
| 3:19:38| This is resolution R-10-9-701, approving an agreement of sale in the amount of $225,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11978)|
| 3:19:45| the city of Knoxville to contribute $112,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11985)|
| 3:19:49| with Ben F. McAuley, Jr., doing business as custom craft defense for the acquisition of property located at 4630 Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11989)|
| 3:19:57| for the purpose of expanding Burlington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| Name and address for the record if you would explain the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| Yes, Doug Battelle, Director of Parks and Recreation, Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| We now have, as requested last meeting, a signed contract from Mr. McAuley for the prices, as requested, $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12006)|
| 3:20:16| He will pay at closing the taxes that are due, as well as a note that's still left on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12016)|
| 3:20:22| He's asked for two small changes on the contract that I believe are signed on, the copies you should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12022)|
| 3:20:31| He's asked that his tenant there, which has been a good small business, be given 90 days to vacate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:36| As a department, we don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| It allows that person to find a viable place to do his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12038)|
| 3:20:43| He is looking now, so hopefully that will be shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| The other one is that he will pay off that loan at closing, as he'll be exchanging checks at closing, as you often do with a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12045)|
| 3:20:53| He doesn't have the funds available just to write that check before closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12053)|
| 3:20:57| So, with regards to any taxes or anything, all of that will be paid as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12057)|
| 3:21:01| Right, he would be responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| What are your plans on the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| The billboard as it stands right now, we did discuss this at our park board meeting, it would stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12065)|
| 3:21:10| We inherit the current lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12070)|
| 3:21:12| The advisory board is very much in support of looking at long-term, if we could remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12072)|
| 3:21:17| But I think everyone understands it's kind of part and parcel if we want the property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12077)|
| 3:21:22| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12082)|
| 3:21:26| Mr. Jarrett, you wanted a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12086)|
| 3:21:29| Is this what you have an opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12089)|
| 3:21:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12093)|
| 3:21:34| My concern was after the title search, we discovered a lien of approximately $25,000 on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12094)|
| 3:21:39| So we crafted the contract in such a manner that all liens, encumbrances, indebtedness are paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12099)|
| 3:21:47| and that he has to give us a clear and clean and complete title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12107)|
| 3:21:52| The billboard essentially runs with a subsequent purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12112)|
| 3:21:58| Whether or not long-term, that would have to be negotiated actually with the billboard owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| The billboard owner does have the ability at least to access the property by way of an easement to maintain the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12123)|
| 3:22:10| What the future holds for years down the road, it's debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12130)|
| 3:22:15| For the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12135)|
| 3:22:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12136)|
| 3:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12137)|
| 3:22:18| Because those things cannot be, and I think there's a transferable right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12138)|
| 3:22:22| isn't there a set amount in the city limits, 400, and when you tear one down, it's gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12142)|
| 3:22:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12149)|
| 3:22:30| But this particular one, you know, in terms of the mutual assent of the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12150)|
| 3:22:36| then Knox County will inherit it essentially until such time it's renegotiated or that expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12156)|
| 3:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12164)|
| 3:22:45| You feel it right on the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12165)|
| 3:22:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12166)|
| 3:22:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12168)|
| 3:22:50| Should we move this on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12170)|
| 3:22:53| We'll put it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12175)|
| 3:22:56| Item number 29, Hugh Holt, if you'll make your way down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| This is Resolution R-10-9-801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12179)|
| 3:23:02| It's determining the method of disposal of property at 232 Churchwell Avenue, known as Oakwood School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12182)|
| 3:23:08| So Hugh left us, so Grant, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12188)|
| 3:23:11| Grant Rosenberg, Director of Community Development, 400 Main, Suite 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12191)|
| 3:23:16| This is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| There's three ways Knox County can dispose of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12198)|
| 3:23:24| One is a negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| Two is an auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12206)|
| 3:23:27| And three is a request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| The Finance Department recommends a request for proposals be the method of disposal for Oakwood Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12210)|
| 3:23:39| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| How come an RFP instead of an auctioneering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12220)|
| 3:23:43| Well, RFP gives the county a little more control over the process and what happens to that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12223)|
| 3:23:51| The school board that just surplused the property recommended that an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| They prefer RFP be the method of disposal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12236)|
| 3:23:59| And the neighborhood as well agrees that an RFP be the preferred method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12239)|
| 3:24:06| We have a little more control over the process and what happens to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12246)|
| 3:24:10| So we can put the RFP out and then reject it if it comes before us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12250)|
| 3:24:14| And any sale resulting from the RFP would have to come before this body for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12254)|
| 3:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12259)|
| 3:24:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12260)|
| 3:24:22| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12262)|
| 3:24:24| I don't know who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12264)|
| 3:24:25| This may be a question for you or Grant, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12265)|
| 3:24:28| What kind of shape is it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12268)|
| 3:24:30| What's the bad part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12270)|
| 3:24:32| It's where the teacher's depot place was, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12272)|
| 3:24:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:36| The same place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12276)|
| 3:24:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12277)|
| 3:24:38| What needs to be fixed with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:39| I mean, what's it valued at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12279)|
| 3:24:40| What kind of asset do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12280)|
| 3:24:41| It's a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| I would call it a liability before I call it an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| It is in very poor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| The old portion of the building is no longer occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12288)|
| 3:24:51| It's been boarded up for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| It is literally falling apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12293)|
| 3:24:55| The roof is pretty much all gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| It's become a pigeon haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12298)|
| 3:25:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| The newer portion, which is built, I believe, in the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12303)|
| 3:25:06| David, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12306)|
| 3:25:09| And the East Tennessee Community Design Center did a study of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12309)|
| 3:25:12| and that's available on their website, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| We'll try to make that information available to the commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| But I think they did an estimate on stabilizing the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12318)|
| 3:25:22| getting it remediation and stabilizing the building to be around a quarter million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12322)|
| 3:25:28| Demolishing the building was going to be slightly less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12328)|
| 3:25:32| because, again, you have a lot of asbestos environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12332)|
| 3:25:35| and even tearing down the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| But it's on the Fragile 15 list with Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| It's a historic building, and it's a great building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| It's a great building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12343)|
| 3:25:44| It has a lot of potential, and it could be a real asset for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12344)|
| 3:25:47| But at this point, as it is right now, it's a liability to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12347)|
| 3:25:51| This is the second time we've done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12351)|
| 3:25:54| Hugh, you and I went over to the place over in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12354)|
| 3:25:57| and just the whole sky was open because of gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12357)|
| 3:26:00| Guys, that's assets to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12360)|
| 3:26:02| Knox County owns that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12362)|
| 3:26:04| That's our property, and we're not taking care of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| So if we do decide to sell it, we're getting pennies on the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12367)|
| 3:26:11| If we need to spend some money on some stuff to keep it on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:15| until we're ready to sell something, that just blows my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12375)|
| 3:26:18| why we're not maintaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12378)|
| 3:26:20| Maybe that's a question for the school board, for their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12380)|
| 3:26:22| They have several buildings and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| but now we're going to get nothing for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12384)|
| 3:26:27| If we'd spent $40,000 to $50,000 to fix the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12387)|
| 3:26:30| we could have got a lot more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12390)|
| 3:26:32| So this, you know, I don't know who's – is that a PBA question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12392)|
| 3:26:36| It's the schools. It was in possession of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12396)|
| 3:26:39| The schools just turned it over to the county two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12399)|
| 3:26:44| So the county, general county government, just acquired the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12404)|
| 3:26:48| We really actually haven't officially acquired the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12408)|
| 3:26:51| We won't acquire it until November 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| We're not being good stewards of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| You know, the taxpayers paid for this at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12415)|
| 3:26:58| and we're just letting our properties go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| That just aggravates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12420)|
| 3:27:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12423)|
| 3:27:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12424)|
| 3:27:06| I'm going to duck from Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| but isn't this something that the insolvency board should probably start looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12429)|
| 3:27:17| And I am being serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| I mean, somehow, because I'm kind of in agreement with Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12439)|
| 3:27:23| and I am in agreement with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12443)|
| 3:27:26| I think, you know, these properties, we need to have a say in what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12446)|
| 3:27:31| I appreciate you all making a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| but, you know, it would be nice for us to kind of take a proactive approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:39| as opposed to being reactionary when Hugh or Grant comes to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12459)|
| 3:27:42| and say that we have this and what can we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| We suggest this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| So I'm on that board, so I'm creating work for both of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12467)|
| 3:27:51| But the law director's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| I don't know if that's within the scope of what the insolvency board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12473)|
| 3:27:57| but based on the explanation that we heard earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12477)|
| 3:28:00| that might be an opportunity for us to get more involved in our properties a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| Hugh, could you get us a list from the schools of vacant properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12486)|
| 3:28:10| or vacant buildings that they have, also from the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12490)|
| 3:28:13| Could you provide that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| I think that would be very helpful to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| So we can, you know, take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12498)|
| 3:28:22| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12502)|
| 3:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12504)|
| 3:28:25| Yeah, it is the school system's responsibility to maintain these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12505)|
| 3:28:29| and they don't because they say that they need to put their money into maintaining the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12509)|
| 3:28:34| the facilities that are in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| and they don't want to take any money away from classroom or away from the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:41| to maintain a building that's no longer in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| And so it does fall into horrible disrepair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| and then it becomes desperately difficult to try to save it and do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12527)|
| 3:28:52| Oakwood School is in the middle of a very dense residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12532)|
| 3:28:59| and it's very, very important to that neighborhood that we maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:04| and they also have a say in what goes into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12544)|
| 3:29:09| that it would be very irresponsible of us to just auction it to the highest bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12549)|
| 3:29:15| to do whatever they want with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| It's very important, I think, that we have a role in what happens with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12557)|
| 3:29:23| and the neighborhood needs to have a voice in that as well because it is, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12563)|
| 3:29:27| and I mean there's neighbors on each side and across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12567)|
| 3:29:31| It's right in the middle of a very dense neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12571)|
| 3:29:35| So I hope that we will follow Grant's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12575)|
| 3:29:40| Yeah, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12581)|
| 3:29:42| We have asked a member of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association, Bill Hutton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12582)|
| 3:29:47| to serve on the evaluation committee for the request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12587)|
| 3:29:51| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12591)|
| 3:29:52| We certainly want to engage the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12592)|
| 3:29:54| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12594)|
| 3:29:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12596)|
| 3:29:57| This is back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| It also ties in with Commissioner Broyle's statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12599)|
| 3:30:03| Sometime in the last two years we've had a piece of property in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12603)|
| 3:30:07| Did we ask for proposals on it to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12607)|
| 3:30:10| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12610)|
| 3:30:11| And the proposal came back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| And the proposal came back and was submitted to the commission and rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12613)|
| 3:30:18| And then it was auctioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| It was auctioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12620)|
| 3:30:21| And the difference between the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| It was roughly about $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12623)|
| 3:30:28| And the comment that we need control of it, we have control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12628)|
| 3:30:34| The city of Knoxville has control of what might happen at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12634)|
| 3:30:38| The difference here is, though, nothing and something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12638)|
| 3:30:43| Maybe no dollars or $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12643)|
| 3:30:48| So all I want people to remember is that in the last couple of years we've had one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12648)|
| 3:30:56| and the proposal was insignificant and the auction price was insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12656)|
| 3:31:03| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12663)|
| 3:31:04| Just, you know, one comment and one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12664)|
| 3:31:07| I'll ask the question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| And it really, you know, refers to what Amy was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12669)|
| 3:31:14| protecting the neighborhoods around there where people can't do whatever they want to with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12674)|
| 3:31:19| How are schools zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12679)|
| 3:31:21| I mean, it's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12681)|
| 3:31:22| What will be the zoning on that school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12682)|
| 3:31:25| I mean, how does that usually work, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12685)|
| 3:31:28| I'd have to look, but I believe the property is zoned historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12688)|
| 3:31:32| Is it zoned H1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| I don't know if that school itself is zoned H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12694)|
| 3:31:38| That neighborhood does not have an H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| But it was one of the schools that were, there were several schools that were closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12701)|
| 3:31:45| when Christianberry Elementary was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| Lincoln Park was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| Oakwood was closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12709)|
| 3:31:50| And there was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| Brownlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12712)|
| 3:31:53| Brownlow, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12713)|
| 3:31:54| All three of those buildings were closed when they built the new Christianberry Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12714)|
| 3:32:00| also in Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12720)|
| 3:32:02| And Oakwood has become just a horrible mess, except for the part where they had the depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12722)|
| 3:32:11| Lincoln Park has become our adult home economics, vocational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12731)|
| 3:32:18| And Brownlow, they've been trying to convert into condos now for well over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12738)|
| 3:32:24| And that's taking a long time and has not been very successful is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12744)|
| 3:32:30| I believe Brownlow is occupied by tenants, owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12750)|
| 3:32:36| And then the second comment is that maybe we need a property management committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12756)|
| 3:32:42| because what we need to do is that, and I understand exactly what Larry is saying about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12762)|
| 3:32:47| the stewards of public property, but what we really need to do is to have someone looking down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12767)|
| 3:32:53| I mean, we don't need to wait until it falls into disrepair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| and then have to spend a lot of money to fix it so we can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12776)|
| 3:32:58| We need to get rid of the property before it gets in bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12778)|
| 3:33:01| Is that the insolvency board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| We could change the name of the insolvency board to the property management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12783)|
| 3:33:06| Because, I mean, because if it becomes obvious that there's no plan used, then we need to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12786)|
| 3:33:12| Because, I mean, that's really what happened with the South Knoxville High School and it sounds like what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12792)|
| 3:33:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12798)|
| 3:33:19| And also our department, I know, and Commissioner Broyles has been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12799)|
| 3:33:22| We have a vacant property task force, which has been city, county, county law department, county trustees office, city, city law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12802)|

| 3:33:33| You know, and just as a final comment, maybe this is something with the new administration coming on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12813)|
| 3:33:39| and I hope they do look at all the property that the county has and to see what really is excess property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12819)|
| 3:33:44| and let's sell it, get it back on the tax rolls, get it so we're not having to maintain some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12824)|
| 3:33:51| So I think that's something that we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| Commissioner Briggs, I know they're working on that for a fact because I have provided them some information in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12833)|
| 3:34:00| So they are looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12840)|
| 3:34:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12842)|
| 3:34:03| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12843)|
| 3:34:04| Amy, just a real quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12844)|
| 3:34:05| That's your district, I'm assuming, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12847)|
| 3:34:08| If that was fixed up and it wasn't a disrepair, in your mind, could that be a nice place for some condos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12848)|
| 3:34:14| Would the people like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12854)|
| 3:34:16| See, that's what I'm getting at, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12856)|
| 3:34:18| You know, we let a perfectly good structure get away that we could have sold for condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12858)|
| 3:34:22| It would also be fabulous for a child care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12862)|
| 3:34:26| It would be fabulous for an assisted living facility for seniors if it had been kept up all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12866)|
| 3:34:33| Now it's such a huge liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12873)|
| 3:34:36| I wouldn't be surprised if we have a hard time finding a developer who can do something with it and make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12876)|
| 3:34:42| You call Cherokees if they're interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12882)|
| 3:34:45| So your recommendation, again, is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12885)|
| 3:34:48| RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12888)|
| 3:34:49| Disposition by RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12889)|
| 3:34:50| Is everyone okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12890)|
| 3:34:52| Is that a consent item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12892)|
| 3:34:55| Okay, so we'll put that on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12897)|
| 3:34:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12898)|
| 3:34:59| Can we have a brief recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12899)|
| 3:35:00| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12900)|
| 3:35:01| 434, 445, we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12901)|
| 3:35:05| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12905)|
| 3:35:06| Is that nine minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws100920part1?start=12906)|
