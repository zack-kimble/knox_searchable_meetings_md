| 0:00:11| Greve in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=11)|
| 0:00:15| We're thankful tonight for another opportunity to serve our city, fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=15)|
| 0:00:19| citizens, an opportunity that's easy to take for granted while many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=19)|
| 0:00:23| aren't granted such freedom, such democracy. We pray for those who protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=23)|
| 0:00:27| that freedom. We're thankful for those who've recently left us, including Mary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| Lou Horner, Charlie Richmond, Bruce McCarty, and all people who've given so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| much to our community, making it a better place to live. Please be with those less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| fortunate, keeping them safe and warm on this cold night. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| Let's pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=45)|
| 0:00:51| republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=57)|
| 0:01:02| Well, Happy New Year to everyone. I hope you had great holidays and so far the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| year started off well. I'll ask Ms. Mitchell to call the roll. Councilman Brown. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| Councilman Campin. Here. Councilman Della Volpe. Here. Councilman Greve. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=73)|

| 0:01:29| approve the minutes? Motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| minutes are approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn? Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| Councilman Greve. Thank you, Mayor. Yes, 12C, an ordinance of the council having to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| with the green construction code. Council members did receive an email and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| information from Ms. Branson and so I'd like to postpone that for six months. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| there are any questions, she's certainly available to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| Councilman Brown. Mayor, I wanted to move to postpone. Let me let me vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| one first. Yeah, I thought you were going to talk to this issue. Okay, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| motion and a second. This is to postpone the green building codes, construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| codes for six months. We're going to set up a task force and do a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| education and planning on this before we bring it back to you. So we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| ordered. Mayor Brown. Yes, Mayor, I want to move to postpone item 12I. For two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=163)|
| 0:02:54| weeks? For two weeks to the next meeting of council, I believe January the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| That is a property naming issue? Second. Councilman Starr. Thank you, Mayor. I'm the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| head of the Public Property Naming Committee and there was a mix-up in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| You know, they applied at MPC to rename this this alley. It didn't go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| Public Property Naming Committee so we're going to have an emergency meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| of that committee on the 17th, probably at 430. So we'll address it then and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=201)|
| 0:03:31| then it'll come back to council. Okay, so we have a motion and a second. All in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. Let's see, anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| for postponement? Councilman Grieve. Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| Okay, our consent items 11P to 11U are our pensions and 12O to 12R are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=234)|
| 0:04:02| 202s. So moved. Second. Motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| ayes have it and so ordered. For the mayor's report, I understand we have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| students from the Nature's Way Montessori School. Where are you? Oh, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| student. Stand up for us. Thank you for being here. I understand that you're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| to watch our council meeting and then write a report about it. Is that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| for school? And perhaps some other students will be coming at another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| meeting? Okay, well we are happy that you, why don't you come to the podium and tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=270)|
| 0:04:39| us your name and what grade you're in. My name is Caitlin Patterson and I'm in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| seventh grade. In seventh grade, great. Well thank you for coming and I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| that you enjoy this meeting and learn something from it and give us some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| advice when it's over. Thank you. Okay, well we're glad that Montessori School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| is here. Also, I want to invite everyone to the planned ET symposium tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| January 9th. It's from 1 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. at the East Tennessee History Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| on Gay Street. I'll be there along with Oak Ridge Mayor Tom Behan and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| other officials from our region who have been involved with planned ET. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| really some good workshops, panel discussions on economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| education, housing, and community health. So it's a great opportunity to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| engaged with the planned ET. This is our regional sustainability planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| as we continue to work on these very crucial regional issues. Again, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| tomorrow, January 9th, from 1 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. at the East Tennessee History Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| downtown. And finally, I want to tell you all that next week I'll be going to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=345)|
| 0:05:53| U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. They're having their annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| legislative conference there in D.C. They've timed it so after that's over we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| stay and go to the inauguration. So I'm very excited about that. I've never been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| to inauguration of any president in our country, so I will be there. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| bad news is that it's during the Martin Luther King event celebration. I always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| enjoy going to those events. So Vice Mayor Pavlis will be representing me at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| the luncheon on Thursday. I appreciate that. And I hope I know many of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| council members will be at many of the events. There are a lot of events from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| Thursday, I think, through Monday celebrating Martin Luther King's birthday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| and his history. So the parade start is on Monday at 10 a.m. and as you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=400)|
| 0:06:49| the parade route goes from Tabernacle Baptist Church on MLK Avenue to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Greater Warner AME Church in Burlington. Also the Thursday before that the MLK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| Awards luncheon is on Thursday January 17th at noon at the Marriott. If you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| tickets for any of these events or you want more information you can call 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| call the city, or go to the website at MLKKnoxville.org and you can get a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| of information about the events. It's always a really wonderful long weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| as we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. That is the end of my report. Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| Thank you Madam Mayor. I just wanted to thank Councilman Campin for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| mentioning the passing of Charlie Richmond. He was a lifelong South Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=456)|
| 0:07:44| civilian, very active of the South Knox Foundation. He was an architect and recently had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| worked on the Harris Chapel Baptist Church that had burned back in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| He loved to restore old homes, houses, and what-have-you, and he restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| eight houses in the old North Knox neighborhood as a matter of fact. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| more important to me and to South Knoxville and Knoxville as a whole was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| his love and his devotion to the Candor Arts and Heritage Center. He was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| serving acting president of the board. He was a founding member since 2000. He of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=495)|
| 0:08:24| course was there all the time. Every time I was there he was always there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| promoting Candor and all the activities there. And it's certainly an asset and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| crown jewel of South Knoxville and the city as well right in the heart of Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| He of course during Vestal he was always there. He worked from daylight to dark. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| mean he was just there manning the booths and doing all the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| nobody else really wanted to do and that was his real passion. And he just will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| missed. He was loved by many and just a real dedicated soul to not only South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| Knoxville but this county and the city as a whole and he'll be missed. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Vice Mayor. I'm sure we all agree with those words. Councilman Grave. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| Mayor. I also want to thank Councilman Campton for mentioning Bruce McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Bruce lived in my district. I've known Bruce for quite some time and Bruce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| Bruce's passing as well as Charlie's as far as the architectural community is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| great loss. Bruce was 92 years old. It's interesting that I have asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=564)|
| 0:09:31| Councilor Frost to do a resolution that we'll present at the next council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| meeting but it's interesting that when you go around this city you realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| the architecture that we have in this city owes a great deal to Bruce McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| In fact the building we're in is one of his one of his buildings but you can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| to the Coliseum, you can go to the libraries in town, you can go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| churches. He was the master architect for the World's Fair and he also not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| did he do fantastic architecture and leave his mark with that but he was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| one of the founding members to bring the School of Architecture to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| of Knoxville. But it's probably his greatest joy and the thing that he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| most proud of in the conversations that I had with him was the East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| Community Design Center. He was actually the founder. He had gone to Philadelphia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| to see how that one was developed and he came back and worked very hard to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| what we have today which is the Design Center. And those people that would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| to remember Bruce, memorials can be made to that. The other thing that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| wanted to say is there's hardly there's very few architects in this town that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| didn't have some relationship with Bruce. His firm spawned a lot of architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| firms. They also spawned a lot of architects that are now working. In fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| one of the reasons that I'm back in Knoxville is that he got in touch with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| me in Detroit while I was working there and asked if I would come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Knoxville and work. So it's been a long relationship. It's one that I'm gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| miss him and we're you know we can celebrate his life inside this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| that we're in right now. So but we'll have more to say when we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| resolution. But I just wanted to remember Bruce also. Thank you. Councilman Delivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| Yes, thank you Mayor. Again I'll thank Mark Campin for his words during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| invocation. I wanted to mention John Craig, a name that didn't come up, but he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| was a quiet gentle man that lived in Holston Hills area and was very very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| active in his community. He was the kind of person that you know didn't have his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| name out front, but if there was something to be done he was a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=685)|

| 0:11:35| decades and decades. He was just the kind of person that made the community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| needs his own and we certainly appreciate his service to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| and mourn his passing. Thank you. And I can't let this pass without also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| recognizing Mary Lou Horner. Many of us were at the funeral on Sunday. She| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| certainly was a legend in her own time as a County Commissioner and a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| special service. Congressman Duncan and Bill Williams from Channel 10 both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| spoke and as well as some wonderful music and the words of her pastor. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| served with Mary Lou on County Commission. She and Bea Vassell were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| first two women ever elected to County Court, which later became County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Commission. Then came Wanda Moody, then came me. So I was the fourth person and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| so I learned a lot from Mary Lou and from Bea and from Wanda, those first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| three women who kind of set the path, particularly Mary Lou and Bea, who set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| the path for women to run for local office like that for a County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| So she will also be missed in Knoxville. Okay, let's move on. 8A is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=754)|
| 0:12:43| confirming the reappointment of Jackie Lane and Vice Mayor Nick Pavlis to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=763)|

| 0:12:58| ordered. 8B is a resolution confirming the appointments of Karen Eberle and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Hubert Smith to the Knoxville Transportation Authority Board. Move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| approve. I believe we have Karen is here. Would you please stand up? Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| being willing to serve on the KTA. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, I'd just like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| that I had spoken with Hubert and he sends his regrets. He had a prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| engagement and he certainly was worried about snubbing the council, but I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| we understand and he called and I think he's been a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| advocate and busy in that business for a long time and I'm sure he'll serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| well. Right, I think he will too and so appreciate both Karen and Hubert being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| willing to serve on KTA. We got some exciting news coming soon. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| catamorphosis 2.0, so you will have a big job to do, Karen, to work with KTA to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| get all of this implemented. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 9A is an ordinance to amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Knoxville City Code Chapter 17 Articles 2 and 6 to allow car sharing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=843)|

| 0:14:39| approve. Second. Councilman Dallavopi. Yeah, just a quick question, Mayor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| Mark Donaldson, I guess. My only concern was when we amended that one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| sections in there, I'm flipping quickly to try to find it, but we took out these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| the the space standard for what a parking space is in terms of the square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| footage or whatever and I understand the reason for doing that. Will you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| some substitute standard in there or is it going to be purely discretionary? In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| other words, we'll now have a definition that doesn't have like any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| meets and bounds or even a discussion of at least X unless there's Y or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| Thank you, Mark Donaldson with MPC. There are space dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| requirements stated elsewhere in the zoning ordinance and are in fact in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| conflict with the ones that are in the definition. The ones in the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| are wrong, so we were finally getting around to taking that out. So they'll go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| to a table or some other place to find the actual requirements. All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| That's what I wanted to know. Thank you. I also want to just recognize what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| doing here tonight. Part of this is that we are now going to allow pervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| pavement, pervious parking lots in our city and of course from an environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| standpoint, this is a big move and with the new stormwater regs, we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| every drop of water that goes rolling off and into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| stormwater, we have to manage and it gets costly. It's more and more costly every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| year and we know that by keeping that water on site and letting it go back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| refilling the water table, all of that stuff is environmentally a progressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| thing to do as a community. So we are very excited about this move tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| ordered. Nine C's in ordinance to remove property located, rezone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=996)|

| 0:16:43| Road from R1 to O1. Brennan Garrett, applicant, 4th District. Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1003)|
| 0:16:52| Second. Councilman Daldolfi. Yes, I just have a question. It might be for Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| Hagerman, although Mark might be the one to answer it. There are some photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| in the back about flooding because the back of this property has a creek and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| gather from the MPC hearing notes, it wasn't the phase to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| stormwater runoff. Is that something that will be addressed in the later step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| I'll take it. I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City. The stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1039)|
| 0:17:29| regulations, there's sort of two different answers for this. Current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| stormwater regulations don't allow any additional runoff from a developed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| So development of this site can't make flooding any worse if it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| consistent with regulation. As the regulations get tighter, as we get a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| permit for the city from the state for the city, the TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| general permit, TDEC NPDES permit, the regulations tighten further and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1076)|
| 0:18:09| require, we will require that the first inch of runoff is infiltrated on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| which is one reason that that pervious paving thing was important. It gives us another tool to make that possible, but anyway, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1094)|
| 0:18:24| currently it can't get worse. In the future it should actually get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| when you develop the site. As a practical matter, you address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| questions when there's a site plan, right? We're just talking zoning now. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| That's a site plan kind of question. When someone goes for a permit or something. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| All right, thank you very much. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1122)|

| 0:20:06| Audit Committee that this is something that doesn't happen every year. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| the current contractor for almost eight years, Kew & Company, and they've done a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| fine job for the city, but we believed it was important to go out to go out for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| bid and we requested quotes and proposals from folks and we had eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| responders and we narrowed it down to four. We interviewed all of the competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| firms and selected unanimously the Crosland firm because of its background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| and skill and its price was also reasonable. That wasn't the determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1236)|

| 0:22:31| my neighbors that I've talked to would like to support the move of the city to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| acquire this property to solve a long-term problem we've had in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| neighborhood in the North Hills neighborhood proper. I think this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| only vacant a long-term vacant house and a house that we consider to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| blighted within the neighborhood. Several people have approached the owner over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| the years to attempt to buy this house and to put it back into service with with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| no with no positive results. This house I want you to also know that this house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| is number 53 of a hundred and thirty contributing primary buildings and read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| that as houses in the North Hills National Historic District. The district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| includes the area bounded by North Hills Boulevard, Fountain Park Boulevard, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| North Park Boulevard. As a National Register property the house fits very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| well within our neighborhood and several several of my neighbors who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| involved in construction and myself included have looked at the house at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| least from the outside. It has a good roof on it has had a good roof for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| years and is structurally sound although cosmetically it needs an awful lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| work. The kitchen was torn out of the house with the obvious intention of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1436)|
| 0:24:04| restoring that. New kitchen cabinets are sitting in the floor and the appliances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| are sitting in the living room. Heating air conditioning was taken out. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| new unit sitting inside the house so the intention originally obviously was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| fix the house up and we we certainly would support that. We want to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1460)|
| 0:24:29| house restored and we want to see the house become another another of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| neighborhood housing and we would like to see good neighbors in in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| So we in North Hills I think I can say we'll do whatever we need to do to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| that that happens and several of us over the years have complained to to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| a number of times concerning this house and our intention is to to try to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| make this happen. Oh anyway that's thank you. Thank you very much Mr. Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| Okay we have a motion and a second. Oh I'm sorry Councilman Wallace. Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| it's I want to ask Miss Wade and just what the process will be from from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| on out. You don't you're estimating paying thirty five thousand but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| not a hard line so just walk us through the process and how that goes and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| your intentions how you will go about the sales process. Okay thank you. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development. If this is approved this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| evening then we will request that KCDC pursue acquisition of this property. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| may try to negotiate a sale with the owner. That's one way that it could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| You know we would offer probably a praise value pot maybe less but out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| that money the past due taxes would be paid. There's approximately fourteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| thousand dollars in past due taxes on this property. If that's not successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| they would take the property through eminent domain in which case the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| would be taken out of the the price that would be paid in court which would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| praise value and the balance then would go to the owner. After that's finished we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| would list the property in the Homemakers Program for sale with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| conditions like all of our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| Okay thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=1594)|

| 0:38:19| the amendment first conversation okay also it came up there was a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| that came up in terms of the responsibility of the work that had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| done in the past and I think if mr. Swanson if you could address that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| terms of the when the situation was found that there was falling panels out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| there well obviously the situation out there is very disappointing you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| expect your brick panels to fall off after they've been put up and it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| disappointing to us that that has happened and it's not the performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| for those panels that we would have expected to receive from those panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| from a legal point of view however there is there's something called a statute of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| repose which is a period of time within which you've got to sue if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| to sue with regard to architects and contractors it starts to run from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| date of substantial completion of whatever the project may be there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| some rare and limited exceptions to it we do not have any evidence that we fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| into one of those rare and unusual exceptions in this case and so we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| we the statute of repose has run and well run over four years since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| statute of repose ran which means your your right to sue is cut off in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| case so we do not believe we have legal redress against the original contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| or the manufacturers of the of the improvements that are up there but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| still need to address it and we need to put brick veneers back up there was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| understanding the project was finished in 2004 and the repose would be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| in 2008 we discovered 2011 I think my understanding was found in 2011 right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| but it is a situation that we need to act on this and get this underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2410)|

| 0:42:17| rental of the parking space to to Zipcar and I realize this is a kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| demonstration program but but at some point we start giving away revenue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2541)|

| 0:42:30| Jake Tisinger project manager for the office of sustainability yes the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| goal of this is to ensure viability of a car share program within Knoxville so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| for the duration of the agreement which I believe is after a year both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| could agree to extend it from that point there'll be no exchange of money between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Zipcar or the city of Knoxville but in the future we might actually rent those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| spaces to them or something it's it's not explicitly stated in the agreement I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| don't believe that's the intention at this point as far as I understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| those will be the Zipcar spaces and if at some point we decided we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| that we could have a new agreement with them or start to talk to them I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| ask that you look at that for the future not for this particular agreement but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| it seems to me that downtown parking spaces are precious and we ought to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| some revenue to cover our costs of just making them available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| thank you Mary that was my concern you know especially when you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| parking spaces on Clinch Avenue and Gay Street you know it's right next to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| Holston I'm sure there's a lot of residences a lot of people that live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| the Holston that enjoy parking in those parking spaces in the weekends and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| a downtown resident if that was on my street I wouldn't really appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| but I'm in favor of this project but I think that's something we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| consider in the long term of course let's remember you know the irony of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| this is the Zipcars the idea is to make it so fewer people have to have cars you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| know can take public transit and can have other options so they so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| actually ends up ultimately freeing up spaces as more people use alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| transportation knowing that they have a Zipcar available to them should they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| actually need to use it so again this is another example of our sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| efforts that I think we're trying some new things here in Knoxville certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| this is being done in other places very effectively so I appreciate Jake and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| office of sustainability for bringing this opportunity to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Councilman Wallace yeah I would just dovetail on that and say was there can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| you approach maybe approach UT in the future and maybe they could supply some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| parking lots we've given them some streets here recently this year and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| would hope that they would maybe donate or make available some spots on instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| of taking our city streets so let's make that as a dovetail. Councilman Grieve I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2697)|

| 0:49:44| substandard road and I was curious why the solution wasn't to make them get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| road up to standard so that future residents of that property when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| developed we'll have a city road and won't be complaining to us to to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| it and make it a city road where we're quick claiming it to make it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| private road but where does that leave us downstream I mean do we not have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| bond or anything like that that would be a Jim Hagerman question but MPC what did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| you weigh that in terms of asking them to repair the road or widen the road or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| do what it takes to make it a proper road the Planning Commission doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3018)|

| 0:50:40| speak to that I was thinking mr. Hagerman might have that piece of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| puzzle just in terms of of if we have let's let's I'm really speculating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| little bit if we have a subdivision area that ends up getting fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| developed and we have residents clamoring for fixing their road we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| probably going to be the guys on the short end of the stick so so so what do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| we do about that so the solution in this particular case the roads are so bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| that you pretty much have to take them out and redo it they could not even give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| it away because it would require so much of an investment to get it back up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| standards the solution for now anyway until the value of land goes up or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| know development pressure makes it more valuable is to close the roads replant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| as one lot so all of those roads go back into the ownership of the this one lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| so in the future someone wants to develop it they have to do a road yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| they have to start from scratch okay so they go back to square one it's not like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| we're going to end up having little lots sold off this without the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| being put in there that's correct there have been no no lot sold that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| some utility some infrastructure in place but no construction no lot sold so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| so the expectation is we're not going to be put in the position of homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130109?start=3119)|
