| 0:00:25| Heavenly Father, thank you for this beautiful day in East Tennessee and the opportunity that we all have to serve our city as we meet here at the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=25)|
| 0:00:36| Our hearts go out to all of the victims and families who have been affected by the terrorist attacks in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=36)|
| 0:00:49| And we certainly ask you to watch over both the people in those communities and the police and fire and military folks and other public servants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=49)|
| 0:01:02| who are trying to bring order to those communities that are so badly disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| Finally, we ask that you give your blessing on all of our families who are traveling to get with loved ones for the holidays and to celebrate the American Thanksgiving holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=68)|
| 0:01:23| We think that's going to be a good time for families to reflect and be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| And also we ask that we be ever mindful of those who are less fortunate than ourselves. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=88)|
| 0:01:37| Please face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=97)|

| 0:02:09| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| Eight are present. We have a quorum. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Council, before I move on to number five, we get to 11A, which is the Insure Tennessee resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=146)|
| 0:02:35| We have actually six people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| And so just for the six who signed up, council's rules are that up to three people can speak on any issue unless council changes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=158)|
| 0:02:48| Up to three people can speak for up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| So, council, unless you all give me direction, I'm going to ask the six to decide who the three speakers would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| Unless you – is that – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| We try to – that's the standard rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| So I have down here Gary Brown, John Stewart, Mary Wilson, Carter Hall, Todd Shelton, and Will Gabelman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| And I can either take the top three or you all – the six of you can decide what you would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Todd Shelton can be stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Okay, thanks, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| Okay, that leaves five of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| So I'll just give you time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| We won't get there for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Mayor, might I suggest if others want to speak and they don't repeat what the other speakers have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| but just have something to add, we could certainly entertain two more individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Any objections from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| Okay, well, then we'll hear all five and we ask that you try not to repeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| and just so we can keep the agenda moving tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| But we are glad that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=233)|

| 0:05:12| Okay, so for Mayor's Report, I think as everybody knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| we are just two days away from Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| and I want to remind everybody that city offices are closed on Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| And I'm hoping everybody has a great holiday with family and friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| And I do want to thank City Council and all of our city employees for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| I am thankful at Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| for the good work of this council and all of our city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| And also a special thanks to police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| and all of our city personnel who actually are working on Thanksgiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| and over the holidays when we are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| You know, we do have a lot of people who actually end up working on the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| So when you are saying grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| or giving thanks around your dining room table on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| I hope that you'll keep in mind our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| and other city staff that are always on call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| So we also know once we get past Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| then the next day we start Christmas in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| We will be kicking things off with the regal celebration of lights on Friday the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| We have a brand new 42-foot tree in Creech Park Extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| that our public service folks have been getting ready for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| and we will be lighting, along with some help from Santa Claus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| at 6 p.m. on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| That's Friday the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| The Holidays on Ice skating rink will also open Friday on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| And you may have heard there's a change this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| We won't have the tent above the ice skating rink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| so as you walk around you can see people skating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| It will be open air, so we think it's going to be more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| and help keep that kind of openness on the square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| I think it's going to be much more festive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| We're going to give it a try and see how well it works this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| There are a lot of other activities Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| and you can find out all about them on our website at knoxviltn.gov slash Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| Also, our Special Events Office has launched a new app| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| that includes all of the Christmas in the City events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| It's a free download from the Apple or Android app stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| You just search for Knoxville events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Of course, the next big event after this Friday is the WIVK Christmas Parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| which will be on Friday, December 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| The parade begins at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| and will proceed from the Coliseum across Church Avenue to Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| and then up Gay to Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| and then through the Old City on Jackson to Morgan Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| This is always one of our most popular events of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| so look forward to seeing everybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| Early, get a good place to park because it will be crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| Yeah, come on down and maybe have dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Get down there early and enjoy everything that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| And one slightly less festive event to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| because work does go on during the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| we will have a public meeting at 5.30 p.m. next Tuesday, December 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| to discuss the City's applications for federal brownfield cleanup grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| for properties on Jackson Avenue and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| The meeting will be at All Occasion Catering at 922 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| As council members will recall, you approved these applications last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and at this meeting on Tuesday, December 1st at 5.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| representatives from the City's Office of Redevelopment and city consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| will give a brief overview of the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| and the environmental issues associated with each property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| Again, that's 5.30 Tuesday, December 1st at All Occasion Catering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Also, you all may have seen this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| we published a proposed new ordinance for mobile food units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| That's food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| We call them mobile food units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| As I am sure you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| council approved a pilot program for food trucks last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| Since then, our business liaison, Patricia Robledo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| and many other city staff have been working with the mobile food vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| to figure out what works and what doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| So we have incorporated all of that feedback into this proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| which would put mobile food unit regulations into city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Among other things, we have lowered the permit fee for people vending on city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| So we are soliciting public comment on the proposed ordinance from now until December 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| You can find it on the city website at knoxvilletn.gov slash mobile food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| and there is a link there to provide feedback to Ms. Robledo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| Our plan is to review all of those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| and then bring it to council for consideration at your December 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| So I encourage everybody interested in operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=598)|

| 0:21:03| in support of Ensure Tennessee Resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| My name is Gary Brown, as I have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| I live at 412 South David Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| I am a member of the Knoxville-Knox County Volunteer Coalition in support of Ensure Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| or Governor Haslam, I should say, program for Ensure Tennessee that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1288)|
| 0:21:37| The resolution is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| I am a disabled veteran who has access to health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| but approximately 24,000 Tennessee veterans are without the same access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1304)|
| 0:21:56| to both affordable health care as well as affordable health care insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| 400,000 Tennessee residents, mostly working families, are without affordable health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| Studies by Vanderbilt, the University of Tennessee, and the Tennessee Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| estimate that 280,000 would sign up for Ensure Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1337)|
| 0:22:27| of which 26,000, approximately 26,000, are Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| Ensure Tennessee is fully funded by the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| and the Tennessee Hospital Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| The question probably should be not why, but why not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1362)|

| 0:22:55| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| It's good to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| My name is John Stewart, and I live at 6611 Ridge Rock Lane in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1381)|
| 0:23:11| Honorable Mayor and the city council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| I first want to commend and thank Council Member Dan Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| and his co-sponsors, Council Members Wallace, Camden, DelaVolpe, Saunders, and Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| for bringing forward this resolution supporting positive action on Governor Haslam's Ensure Tennessee proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| I enthusiastically urge its adoption, and I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| I will try very hard to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| We are all familiar with the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Almost 300,000 fellow Tennesseans who today find it impossible to obtain health care coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1423)|
| 0:23:50| will be enrolled under Ensure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| These Tennesseans earn too much to qualify for TennCare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and too little to receive coverage through the federal health care exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| They are prisoners in what we've come to call the coverage gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Here in Knox County, my number is 22,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Gary had 26,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| But a significant number of neighbors are in this coverage gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| and they will qualify for health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| In a statewide poll conducted by Vanderbilt University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| 64% of all Tennesseans support acceptance of Ensure Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| and an astonishing 78% believe the General Assembly should at least consider the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| 78% is a significant figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Each year that passes without acceptance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| the state is throwing away $1 billion of federal funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| that we have already paid to the federal government through our taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Through an agreement negotiated by Governor Haslam with the Tennessee Hospital Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| the state's taxpayers will contribute not one thin dime to support Ensure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| Tennessee will be free to leave the plan at any time and for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| These facts are the reason why a lot of your fellow Tennesseans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| your fellow citizens refer to Ensure Tennessee acceptance as a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| You hear it a lot because it is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| The facts are overwhelmingly support acceptance, but at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| when all is said and done, when the final accounting is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| facts are not at the heart of why we must move forward on Ensure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1536)|
| 0:25:42| For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| I was a stranger, and you invited me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| I was naked, and you clothed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I was sick, and you visited me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| Very, very familiar words of Jesus from the Gospel of Matthew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| And I would only add, I was ill and infirm, and you reached out to me with a helping hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1562)|
| 0:26:11| You reached out to me with a helping hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Facts are not at the heart of this debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| because acceptance of Ensure Tennessee is, above all, above all, a moral issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| an issue of how we are to treat our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| and how we are to live as a just and moral community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| That is the true heart of this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| Your adoption of this resolution will put our Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| on the right side of this moral issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| It will send a clear and compelling message to the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| to join with the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| And communities all across Tennessee are doing the same thing we proposed that you would do this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| adopt a resolution urging the General Assembly to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Your action tonight will affirm that justice and decency can still prevail in these unsettled times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1624)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1634)|
| 0:27:33| My name is Mary Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| I live at 5208 Cayuga Drive in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| And I appreciate John Stewart's stating the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and I would like to put some personal stories and real people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| into what he elucidated as being so important for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1672)|
| 0:28:01| I have, for the past three years and just came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| another enrollment of the Tennessee Health Care Campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| finding folks who qualify for the Affordable Care Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| And my experience has been both joyful and some people make fun of me when I jump up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| when I realize that a family now is able to take their children to the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| I also am sad when people do not fit into that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| and are being told they need to keep hope that they may get it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| I also know of two deaths that happened in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| the first year that we started the enrollments of a young woman who was in her 50s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| had no insurance, no savings, no cash, was a very serious heart patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| but the hospital couldn't keep her there and refused to fund any money anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| And she was sent home with hospice to pass away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| I have been very gratified to work with the Tennessee Health Care Campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| teams of volunteers who are not paid for all their kindness and compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| toward people who suffer every day because they can't go to the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| And I personally want to thank you, Mayor Beharo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| for your kindness toward all of these volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and also to the commission for your sponsoring this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| I hope that it will influence some who might have a change of heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| when they realize that you are representing all of the people in your districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| that do not have health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1804)|

| 0:30:19| My name is Carter Hall, and I live at 8406 Wood Road, Coryton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| I'd like to first just start by thanking you all for being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| and thanking the members who brought this before you all to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| So I would just like to start out by saying just how important Insure Tennessee is to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| by saying that I grew up in a rural area in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| I'm from the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So I know a lot of these people that this would affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| The people who would be provided coverage under Insure Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| are my friends and my neighbors, members of my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| These are the people, many of the 280,000 who would be provided health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| are in these rural communities, people that I grew up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| people who I still know to this day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| and people who I will probably know for the rest of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| It is also my family, my friends, and my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| who will feel at least some of the weight lifted off of their shoulders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| knowing that Insure Tennessee is helping to keep hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| that many of them work at from closing due to uncompensated care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| and help them in relieving the fear that they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| from maybe them two possibly one day slipping into the coverage gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And finally, I believe that I can speak for many of us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| when I say that I would like to see Tennessee tax dollars coming back to our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| to help all of our families, all of our neighbors, and all of our community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| This isn't just a moral issue with 280,000 Tennesseans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| 25,000 of which being veterans, who will be provided health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| And this isn't just an economic issue with helping to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| that rural hospitals can remain open and bring 15,000 jobs a year back into our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| or the $1.4 billion that will come back to our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| that each of us has already paid into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| All of these things are at no additional cost to the taxpayers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| and I think that we can all look at this and see that these are very important issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Insure Tennessee does just that by addressing these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| and I would like to ask you all to help pass Insure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| This is an issue that affects all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and so I ask you to please help Tennessee by helping to insure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| And now Will Goobelman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| My name is Will Goobelman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| That's an A, not a U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I live at 301 Lippincott Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| I'm a student at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| and I'm thankful for the opportunity to speak before you all tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| on why it's so essential that you vote in support of tonight's referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| regarding Insure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| When I was three years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| my mom was diagnosed with a devastating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| During the course of her treatment for an unexpected illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| she contracted as an otherwise healthy 40-year-old woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| My family incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| As a result, my mom's health insurance company raised her rates to an astronomical amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| leaving my family no longer able to afford health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| Had it not been for the help of our extended family, our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| and several charitable organizations, we likely would have lost everything that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| I hope that you will agree with me when I say that no mother should worry about losing everything that she has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| because she became ill and cannot afford her health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| especially when the funding is available right now to prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| While I'm fortunate enough to have health insurance now, many of my peers in Knoxville do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| Insure Tennessee is a moral responsibility that we all have, but it also makes sense financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| I'll spare you the details of the finances, as everyone before me has done a great job of explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| I want to thank you all for allowing me to speak before you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| and I hope you all will join me in supporting Governor Haslam's plan to insure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Any discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I want to thank all of those who spoke tonight, some very good remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| And Councilman DelaVolpe, in his prayer, prayed for those who are less fortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| and certainly this is an opportunity to try to help those who are less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this resolution tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And I would agree with everything that's been said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| I think, you know, it really is a no-brainer for the state government to provide low-income citizens of Tennessee benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| provided by the federal government and paid for by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| I think that's an easy call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Keep in mind, everyone, this is a symbolic resolution, and there's a lot of these going around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| but I think it's incumbent upon all of us to keep working until this is achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| So tonight's just one small step in that, but thank you to those who brought it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2121)|
| 0:35:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Okay, I do just want to add that I had the honor of being at the announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| when Governor Haslam announced Insure Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| I went to Nashville for that, so I was pleased to see when this came before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and the support by the number of folks on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| So I think with the passage of this, it will show a coordinated message from all of our city leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| that we're aware of the needs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2163)|

| 0:38:11| Oh, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| I wonder if Dawn Disler is still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I think, is that way in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Yeah, she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| But I think it's important for us to just review quickly some of the expenses of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| transit system and how we rely on grants from the federal and state government as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| from the city of Knoxville's tax revenues to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Maybe Dawn can just give us a quick rundown of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I guess actually the next one coming up, 11F, also has a grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| Dawn, if you would just tell us about the funding and how this helps us keep CAP running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Dawn Disler, Director of Transit for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| The federal grants that we're hoping to be awarded when we apply for them make up a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2339)|

| 0:43:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| My name is Mike Whalen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I live at 1933 Island Home Avenue and I own a piece of property where I practice law at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| 905 Locust Street a couple blocks from here and if you want to pick it up and move it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| to the empty lot on the other side of the river for free, for me, I'd be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I'm concerned with this deal and I want you to know I'm not against economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| I like rational and wise economic development and the deal that's not come out fully that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| I don't think people have talked about in this deal is it's not just $12.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| As I understand it, for the first 10 years of this agreement, they pay only their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| For the next 20 years, they pay $1 per square foot for the next 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| For this third 10, they pay $2 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| If I look at the math and I'm not a real estate guy, being generous, I think you're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| about $2 million a year conservatively on lost rent on this building you're buying back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| to give to Regal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| That's a whole lot of money that's not included in the 12.5 figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| My better half is a movie fanatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| It killed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| We always had to go way east or way west if we wanted to see a movie live in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| Why can't we have a movie theater in downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Well, Regal said you can't have it because you can't make money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Then the city built them a theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| What do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| They're making money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| We started going to the movie theater downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| It's nice, convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| We can have dinner, walk to the movie, head to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| Then Regal comes out and announces this great corporate citizen we're helping that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| going to cut the hours of their employees so they won't have to provide them health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| This is at a time they're making record profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| They're paying their CEO in the millions, and I'm assuming she's getting some health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| care to go along with that on top of the mere million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| This is the corporate citizen that we're going to support, one who will turn its back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| on its employees, the people who make it the money, in order to increase their profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| That doesn't sound like good corporate citizenship to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Then they announce they're doing this because they don't want to be forced into socialism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| They don't like forced socialism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| I'm not aware that they've paid back the money we spent in forced socialism to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| them a theater yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| It seems their aversion to forced socialism is only when it's forced out of their pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| and not when it's forced out of my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| I don't think that this is a good deal in any term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| I'm all for trying to keep business in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| In the time I've been living here, in the time I've been working downtown, I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| lots of growth in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Most of it's been very organic and at the grassroots level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| It's been small folks buying buildings downtown, opening businesses, opening restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| and things roll from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| The idea that we would give this profitable corporation all this money, not to move from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| another state and relocate in Knoxville, but to move across town is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| It just begs the question, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Where are they going with their 325 jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| I understand this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| They can drop it down to 275 immediately and still keep the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| That doesn't sound like economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| That sounds like economic partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And it's a bad partnership because the city's not getting anything out of it, not to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| amount of money we're spending for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Now, from my own selfish point of view, I work right down the hall here every day representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| indigent folks charged with crimes in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| They have not changed the rate they pay us to do that in over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| And the last time they changed it, they said they were recognizing they were only setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| it barely above the Tennessee statewide average for overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| The Tennessee Supreme Court is currently having a task force look at how to spend less money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| defending, giving constitutionally protected rights to the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| They want to spend less money because they're outraged that we spend $36 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| on indigent defense in the state of Tennessee, and you're giving a third of that money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| a profitable corporation to move across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| I don't want to say our priorities are screwed up, but our priorities are screwed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| I'm assuming the fire department, the police department, and several other city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| could find a way to spend $12.5 million that wouldn't require giving it to a corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| If the first group wasn't competent to manage the property, and by the way, as I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| it, they paid $6.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| We're paying $6 million back for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| They get the rest of that property, riverfront property, for $200,000 plus $22 million in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| tax deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| That's a pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| If you told me that was happening, I might have bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| Need to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| I think it's a bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| I think it could be a better deal, but this is not the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| It seems awful quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| I was talking to Councilman Pavlis as I was going in to vote the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| He said, well, there probably won't be a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Could be because folks think the government has sold out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Why am I going to go vote if you guys are just a wholly owned subsidiary of Regal or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Walmart or whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| I would beg you to think this slowly and carefully and take a little time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| It's a lot of money for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Okay, Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| This Regal deal is broken up into several pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| Tonight it looks like we're dealing with the financial accounting part of it as well as transferring some of the funds to the Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2932)|
| 0:49:01| Development Board so that they can carry out the negotiation and finalizing of the leases and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| I'm going to speak out now because it seems like, you know, once the camel's nose is under the tent, it's kind of over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| even if there are important pieces coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| I have struggled with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| I am in favor of the notion that we bring a nice, large corporate headquarters to our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| It's a good selling point to other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| It's a good shot in the arm for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| But I must say that I still am troubled by the economic terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| The idea of a 30-year lease where really they pay little more than the taxes over to the IDB strikes me as not real fair to our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2986)|
| 0:49:59| The taxpayers are getting the benefit of Regal being downtown and maybe the South Waterfront taking off finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| But it strikes me that, you know, if Blanchard and Calhoun didn't think it was a good enough deal for them to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3006)|
| 0:50:16| and they're the ones investing risk capital, why are the taxpayers investing risk capital in this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| I mean, Regal could ride this out for 30 years, not buy the building and basically pay taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| and a little rent in the years 10 through 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| I think we should look hard, and it may be too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| It may be that Christy and all the folks that rolled up their sleeves and negotiated this think this is the best deal we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| But I think we should look hard at finding a way to have rent abatement for the first couple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| as this company settles into new headquarters and spends $4 or $5 million to get it ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| But I don't see why in year four or five they don't start paying something approximating, you know, a commercial value rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3060)|
| 0:51:10| Maybe it could be stair-stepped so that every three or four years it goes up a buck a square foot or $2 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| But I really think that 30 years for a nominal rent, there's something wrong with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| and I don't think the taxpayers are getting the best end of this, even though they are getting true benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| I'm going to support it at this point because it's all we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| but I really hope that we can find the energy and the ability to find a way to get a better rental return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3092)|
| 0:51:42| I don't know of any trigger in this deal, and, of course, we haven't seen the documents that deal with the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| that requires Regal to buy the building or requires them to reimburse us for some of the expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| if they decide to pull out and move to Denver or Hollywood or wherever else they or Philip Anschutz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| their 50 percent shareholder, wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| Yes, we should get them here. Yes, we should work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Yes, it's okay to give them, you know, some benefits as an encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| That's done all the time by government, but $9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| and they could walk away with the building in 10 years for $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| It seems like it's economically not the best deal we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| and I hope there's some leg room to negotiate a little better on the aspects that are not before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| the actual lease and the actual return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Anyway, those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| I just think that as hard as it may have been to negotiate this deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| it still strikes me that somehow we left money on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| and the taxpayers are bearing that burden, and I'm concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| You know, it's certainly a big project, and I certainly understand Mr. Whelan's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| and some of the challenges we're faced, but I'm very supportive of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| You know, my whole life I feel like, you know, we've seen just Knoxville just sprawl outward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| Residents and businesses just move further and further out from the city center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| and that's changed in the last 15 years, especially downtown with residents, retail, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| It's really come alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| But one of the concerns that I've had, and I think other people have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| is downtown that the market, that the office market has still been soft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| And so bringing a major national brand downtown I think is a tremendous opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3227)|
| 0:53:57| and I hope it really sends a signal to other businesses in the area and the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| that downtown Knoxville is a great place to locate your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| And in addition, it's downtown, but it's also on the south waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| and I think that's a fantastic vision, and I really feel like this will help spur development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3254)|
| 0:54:24| So it is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| It is a tough one to look at, and, you know, we're presented what we have here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| but, you know, I'm going to be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Mayor, thank you, and I appreciate Councilman Starr's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| I, too, am going to support this measure and have it moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| I really like the playing field that is not only in Knoxville but nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| No, I don't really like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| But that's the way the game, if you will, is being played nowadays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| So we need not look any further than Alcoa to see that a company from Arizona is moving there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| I think it's AMI Munitions, $553 million investment, 605 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| It's leaving Arizona because they wouldn't be in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| So, you know, it is good for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| It's good for our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| It's good for South Knoxville, the waterfront, and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| But I guess it comes down to we want to take the risk of rolling a big old set of dice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| that they would have left or stayed if we hadn't given some type of incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| And I don't think we want Knoxville to be known as a city that would have lost, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| corporate headquarters such as Regal or Pilot or anyone along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| or Scripps or anybody like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| So I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| I think Councilman Dellabope made some good points as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| But I just think that it's ‑‑ I trust the administration and Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| that they have brokered the best deal that we could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| I don't know why we wouldn't do so otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| But I think it is a good deal, and I'll be supporting it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| And the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| 11K is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| to negotiate and accept payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes with respect to the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| of a certain building located at 101 East Flint Avenue in the city of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| which the board intends to acquire and lease, and finding that such payments are deemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| to be in the furtherance of the public purposes of the board as defined in Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3428)|

| 0:57:28| redevelopment of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| We have a motion and a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Councilman Dalbock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Yeah, I don't know if Dawn Michelle's here or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| I guess Ann's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| By transferring the title to the city on this, and maybe we already had it and gave it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3460)|
| 0:57:48| KDC, do we run any further risk of having liability for cleanup on that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| I realize the goal here is to get the funding and the cleanup through EPA, and that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Does it leave us a residual, reckless, deep pocket since the original owner has bellied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| up and gone bankrupt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Are we taking any more risk by putting the title in our name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Ann Wallace with the Office of Redevelopment here at Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| The short answer to your question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| The property was acquired at the city's direction and with city funds through KCDC, who is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| purchasing agent, and it's a typical fashion for KCDC to purchase property on the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| EPA viewed this property earlier this year as part of a targeted brownfield assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3521)|
| 0:58:51| that was done for the property to investigate the Phase I and the Phase II in order to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| the environmental concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| And in order to expend federal funds at that time, they had to have an understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| we were not responsible for the creation of the environmental issues, but that we basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| had inherited the problem because of past ownership and that that ownership was no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| But there's no more McClung business out there doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| There's no more the gentleman who owned it, I'm trying to remember his name, Saroff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| He's bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| I guess my question is, does this do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| I mean, it's a heavy metals cleanup thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Maybe we need counsel because this is more of a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| That's a great question, Councilman Della Volpe, and we are very concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| But there are provisions under which, as a bona fide subsequent purchaser, we can avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| that circle of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| We are making sure before we get this property moved over into our name that we don't in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| any way exacerbate our own liability situation here with that circle of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| That's the heart of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| But we can really use these funds in order to clean the property up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| And so if we can actually accomplish that, then we do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| We do, number one, we make the property available for redevelopment so that it's not hazardous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| right, and very marketable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| And secondly, we essentially do away with the liability risk because we've actually taken care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3619)|
| 1:00:27| of the hazardous waste cleanup that would go on out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| But we want to make sure that we don't in any way enhance our liability situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| We are looking at that, and we understand what you're asking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| 12A is the ordinance to amend the 2015-2016 operating and capital budgets so as to provide funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| for economic development in the South Waterfront Redevelopment Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Yeah, I made my comments before in general, and I don't have any problem with the budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| My issues are going to be with the terms of the lease, which we haven't seen yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| So I'm going to support this as I did the prior one, but I really hope there is some room to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| and see if we can't make the economics work a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| And maybe the answer is no, but that's my reservation, not on this motion or this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| but on the actual lease terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3694)|

| 1:01:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Council, no one has signed up for public forum, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Happy Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151124?start=3702)|
