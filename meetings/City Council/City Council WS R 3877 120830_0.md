| 0:00:48| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=48)|

| 0:00:59| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=59)|

| 0:01:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Thanks, everybody, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Thank those in the audience for being here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| We'll try to make this as quick but thorough as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| And with that, I want to go ahead and turn it over to Attorney Frost and let him kind of summarize where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=100)|
| 0:01:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| So Angela Hauber of the city's law department and I, we sat down and we looked at MPC's recommendations that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=112)|
| 0:02:01| that were postponed and will be back up on Tuesday night's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| And we looked at those from a legal standpoint as council requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Additionally, Angela and I met with MPC's executive director, Mark Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| to talk about some things and try to fine tune some things so they'd work in terms of zoning and being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| in compliance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| And then we've also were sent copies of the Fountain City Town Hall letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| which all members of council received and looked at their suggestions, and we find merit in some of their suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=154)|
| 0:02:42| But let me try to frame our scope a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| Due to the Court of Appeals decision in this Mount Juliet case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| you all might recall hearing about that case when the previous zoning dispute come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| That case involved the regulations of crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| And based on that Court of Appeals decision, we believe that the regulations that we're talking about today would only be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| applied to those facilities which have not yet been permitted and built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| Thus, if there is a funeral home which is in business today and has the proper permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| they can have a crematorium even if this council decides to implement the new standards which are being discussed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=203)|
| 0:03:32| The presently existing ones would be grandfathered in because of this Mount Juliet case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| because the case held that a crematorium was complementary to a funeral establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| So when council is considering the topic tonight, when we're discussing funeral establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| keep in mind that it is typically a funeral establishment that has a crematorium aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| But we do recognize that there can be stand-alone crematoriums that can be regulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| and we're going to discuss those here tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| We also recognize that the city only has a portion of the responsibility in the governance of these types of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| For example, the city does not monitor or enforce the clean air standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| so our discussion tonight is going to be germane to what the city has within its power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| We recognize that council wants to consider a workable and management system that both neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| and businesses can understand and work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| We've developed some suggestions for city council, which we'll go over here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| But many of these suggestions or ideas are policy decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| which council is the one that needs to make the decisions for and provide guidance to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=291)|
| 0:05:00| We've kind of anticipated that what we're going to discuss tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| if council is interested in the majority of them, the result will be a substantial change to what MPC has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| and it would have to go back to MPC at a future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| It's, you know, from our earlier meeting with Mark Nolson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| I don't think it's going to go back to the MPC agenda for the month of September, which starts real soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| but rather would go to their October meeting and, therefore, get back to city council later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| but definitely not later than November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| We have some suggestions for council to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| Part of it, you know, we've looked at what is presently in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| but MPC has done a good job in going through and working with definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| and we're going to still work to continue to improve the definitions because Angela| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| and I have looked at them from a legal compliance viewpoint because we want to have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| where it's easy to understand so businesses know what they need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| and people who are interested in the future signing of these locations know what standards to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=376)|
| 0:06:25| Some of the suggestions we talk about, like to mention to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| is funeral homes and stand-alone crematoriums would not be allowed in any residentially zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| That would let neighborhood interests know that they don't have to worry about it being allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| whether it's allowed as of right or even as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| But in order to bridge the gap to this type of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| would like council to consider allowing funeral homes as well as stand-alone crematoriums to be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=416)|
| 0:07:04| in industrial zoned I-4 areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| And then the big policy question for council really to decide is where these types of facilities can be allowed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| commercially zoned areas, office areas, and other industrial zones like I-1, I-2, and I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=438)|
| 0:07:28| The questions are going to be, you know, for the zones, are funeral homes going to be allowed as of right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=448)|
| 0:07:37| Are they going to be not allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Or can they be allowed if they go through the use on review process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| You could submit that certain types of zone or transitional zones between your commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=467)|
| 0:07:56| and your neighborhood, such as O-1 and C-1, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| And those transitory zones, council might decide that maybe they shouldn't be allowed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| But for your other zones, the council might decide, well, just I'm not making this suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| but I'm just giving it for example, industrial zones are traditionally your more heavily types of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| the industrial uses, where you might want to say, well, we'll go ahead and allow these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| these facilities to occur in I-1, I-2, I-3, whether it is a use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=510)|
| 0:08:38| or allowed as of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Presently, funeral homes are automatically allowed in O-1, C-3, C-4, and C-6 zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=521)|
| 0:08:53| Once we have a discussion about the direction council wants to give on the types of zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| we also think it would be good to take up discussion about the distance, the minimum distance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| MPC suggested 200 feet, and that's based in part, and Mr. Donaldson can correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| was a European study that looked at the emissions after 50 meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| And as everybody knows, a meter is a little bit longer than a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| So MPC went with a 200-foot guideline about the possibility of going to a 400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=565)|
| 0:09:34| or 500-foot distance from any school, residence, or park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| Respectfully, the suggestion by Fountain City Town Hall of half a mile, which is 2,640 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=581)|
| 0:09:51| probably is not legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| This is, crematoriums are a legal business, and you can't, by way of zoning, exclude a legal business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=595)|
| 0:10:05| They have to be able to be cited somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| So we'd respectfully submit that that proposal is too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| Also, we looked at MPC's suggestions as well as Fountain City Town Hall's suggestions about monitoring, licensing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=616)|
| 0:10:27| and counting the number of cremations and traditional funeral services offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| And, excuse me, you know, to provide for an enforcement mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=635)|
| 0:10:46| we'd respectfully submit that that might be difficult to set up, that system that licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| and monitors cremations and provides for an enforcement mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| So what we're suggesting for council to consider are a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| For limiting funeral establishments with a single cremation unit with at least two combustion chambers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| and a final emissions burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| And the second one, that the floor area devoted to facilities for cremation be less than one-third of the total floor area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=675)|
| 0:11:24| of the funeral establishment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| The thought behind that, and Fountain City Town Hall also agrees with the single unit idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=688)|
| 0:11:38| is that you're limited in terms of the equipment you have to perform these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| So you're not becoming your accessory use is not becoming your predominant use or your main use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=706)|
| 0:11:55| And also, by objectively limiting it in terms of the size of the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| that might be a way to address the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| And I'll turn it over to Angela Halber or Mark Donaldson for if they have any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| and additional comments or corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| Rob, I actually don't have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| I think you've done a great job of summarizing what we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| Again, it's sort of changing the concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| You were presented with ideas about crematorium regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| and this recognizes that crematoriums are accessory, can be considered accessory to funeral establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| So instead of regulating crematoriums, we're regulating the location of funeral establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| So I think that's, you know, just repeating that that's kind of the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| It's a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| But otherwise, I think you've done a great job of summarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Yeah, should council prefer to proceed with an effort as outlined by Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| I think he's sketched it out fairly well for us so that we have good boundaries within which to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| and can come back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| We would not be able to get it onto an MPC agenda until October, which would put it back to council in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=806)|
| 0:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Just a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Tonight won't be the end of the discussion, assuming council wants to go forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| You know, we'll have to, you know, we'll talk about afterwards where council came down on the different issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=827)|
| 0:13:55| I'm sure there are going to be subsequent meetings with me and Angela and Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| And there's also, you know, there's some minutiae that we're not going to hit upon tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| Like, I mean, if we wanted to, we could literally go to Exhibit B, Version 2, fifth paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| take out the word home, put in the word establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| But we don't see that there's a reason to go through that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| You know, let's get the big things taken care of, and then we'll come back at a later time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| and we'll look over things because it will go on MPC's probably October agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| so there will be plenty of time for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| But, you know, what we're talking about tonight, you know, like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| this is for things that have not yet been permitted or built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| I respectfully suggest that the Gentry-Griffey situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and that current situation isn't going to be affected by our discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| So I respectfully suggest there's not a lot of reason to talk about that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| So just to be perfectly clear, a funeral home that's in existence now in the city of Knoxville can have a crematorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| We have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Over existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| We're talking about new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| I mean, I'm happy to get you a copy of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Well, no, I just wanted to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| And the other question I have, do you have your summary that you've just given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| Do you have that written down for us to have a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Yeah, I can get you a copy tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| I've got just the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| I think for me, anyway, it would be good to have that summary in terms of what you just went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| And I would just repeat that the city's position is that accessory use, that the crematorium can be allowed as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| A stand-alone crematorium would be looked at differently than a funeral establishment with a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Mr. Mandela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| I want to go back to the premise because it strikes me that you have interpreted the law such that we're really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=962)|
| 0:16:14| doing very much here under these regulations if, in fact, I don't know, there must be 15 or 20 funeral homes in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=974)|
| 0:16:23| and you're saying that we have no regulatory control whatsoever over those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| And I want to suggest to you that the case you cited, I haven't read it in eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| and I'm sure there's details that have escaped me, and I have to go back and read it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| But the idea that funeral homes can either embalm people or cremate them or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| and it's all one business, that's what the court was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| And I accept that notion that they go to the same regulatory agency in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| But to me, there's a real difference between, you know, like I said, a place that has a service in a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1017)|
| 0:17:06| it doesn't really impact anyone outside of the building other than some traffic and some people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| and lights on the cars in the funeral procession, and a building that starts putting in a furnace, an incinerator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1033)|
| 0:17:21| a burning device that spews out chemicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| And I don't believe the court that decided that BMC case had anything other than a very theoretical discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1044)|
| 0:17:34| about this because it was very early in the phase of whether or not there was going to be a permit issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| And they really didn't have, and I believe it said, if I can remember, eight months ago, and that's a nice question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| But I think it said that there were no facts in the record about any other details of emissions or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| The reality is there are existing funeral homes, when they want to put a furnace or an incinerator or a smelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| or anything else that's different than the activity they've been carrying out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| and they're going to do something that will affect others in nearby premises in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| and maybe change the character of the area, I submit that there's room for some reasonable regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| Now, I know that Tennessee has a what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| A statute that lets existing businesses continue in operation and expand their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| And the billboard companies were very effective in lobbying for that years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| and they use it all the time to make bigger, higher, you know, double-polled kinds of billboards on an existing site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1119)|
| 0:18:49| But we're going from an activity that's lawfully permitted under our regulations, a funeral establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| to one that's going to have off-premise impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| And we ought to find a way to rationally regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| And if someone wants to test that in court, well, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| We've got lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Let's go to court and find out if that's really the law in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| I think we're jumping too quickly into the fact that we're going to have 20 crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| Now, I realize, you know, it's easy to default to, well, the court said this, so by God, it must be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| And I'm talking about new facilities, not anything about gentry griffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| That's a different matter when it's in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| If we're not going to try to tell funeral establishments in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| here are some criteria you must follow before you get permission to put a smokestack industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| where there was a nice funeral parlor chapel hall, I think we're missing part of the boat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Now, we could take the easy path and say, okay, the first 20 guys are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| and we're going to regulate somebody that comes along in the next 10 years that wants to build a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| But that seems to me to dodge the issue that's important to the people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| The essence of zoning is to put like kinds of things together in places that are compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| and that don't disrupt the normal activity in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| So we have residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| We have business areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| We have industrial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| And now we're going to have this blurring of industrial and commercial or office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| solely on the premise that a court which did not really look at the emissions and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| just was looking at a theoretical question, should they have issued a building permit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| I don't see why we have to go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Maybe we need an attorney general opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Maybe we need our legislators to put some laws into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| But this seems to abdicate the ground to a nice generalized statement from a court opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| I just wonder if there isn't any room anywhere for us to regulate an activity that will affect citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| Well, the issue that I'm happy to provide city council with a copy of, I'll scan it in color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| if people want to see the stuff that I highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| I didn't randomly use crayons on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| But there are a couple of things that I have zoned or focused in on as you were discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| Let me just read a couple of things here briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| The city commission may not, which was Mount Juliet, even if it intends to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| eliminate the funeral home's right to expand operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| and construct additional facilities which involve an actual continuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| and expansion of the nonconforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| And then later on the same page, the court of appeals says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| we conclude that the practice of funeral directing still includes the operation of a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| This is consistent with the general assembly's definition of a funeral establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| to include both funeral homes and crematories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Clearly, state lawmakers do not view funeral homes and crematories as separate industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| but rather as complementary services offered by the funeral industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| I've actually had a conversation with other attorneys whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| or not local governments can actually regulate crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| You mean, you know, at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Why would that be true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Well, it talks about how the state lawmakers, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| the question is if there's a potential preemption issue of taking over the regulation of the crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| I mean, sure, you can have the monitoring of air issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| but those are TDAC issues which are delegated to certain local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| My personal opinion is that folks that are presently existing are going to be grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1367)|
| 0:22:57| Well, and that obviously is the default position that's easy to arrive at looking at that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| because it used really broad language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| But let's go back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| First, on the idea of preemption, I don't know if you know this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| but the state board of funeral, you know, licensing, I'm not sure of its exact name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| but funeral directors, they're a permitting body just like there is for other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| so that if you want to hang your shingle out and say I'm a funeral home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| you've got to have a license because it's an activity that requires some regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| But in discussing this with the people in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| they don't have an extensive occupy the field kind of regulatory scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| When they come to Knoxville and look and see whether you can have a crematorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| they make sure you've got the right zone, that you've got a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| and that you've got adequate bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| That's all they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| They are not looking at any of the impacts of this on living human beings who are affected by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| They are a body that's saying, you know, Joe can be a barber and have a barber shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| This guy can be a funeral director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| And they issue him a license and he pays a fee and maybe he takes an exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| I don't think that's occupying the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| And certainly the heart and soul of the police power that the municipality has is to protect the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1452)|
| 0:24:22| So, again, I'm happy to go along in this other path and get this thing written the way we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| but I really hate to see us just totally abdicate the possibility that we could be regulating this field in a reasonable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| I mean, setbacks, whether it's 400 feet or 500 feet or something from residences or schools or playgrounds, things that affect people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1476)|
| 0:24:45| That's the job we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| That's the policy job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| But you guys may have decided that essentially that our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| We cannot do much more than regulate the next new building to go on the block that wants to be a funeral establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| And then if they want to have a crematory, they have to meet the conditions we set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| And I really wish you could take a second look at that somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| I mean, is there an attorney general we can talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Is there someone we can look at to say that we have a little broader power here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| Rob, isn't this one of the issues that's actually in the Ginger Griffey case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| I know we're not talking about that in detail today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| But assuming that the issue concerning whether --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| Well, I know because it would still be grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| I take that question back because any changes that we make to this ordinance, this ordinance-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| This is only perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| It's only perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| So, really, as I think through that question, any change to the zoning law will not affect any existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1542)|
| 0:25:52| The grandfathering statute is written very broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| And so, I think that I just withdraw my question that I was attempting to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| So we either can regulate a new thing that's coming along the pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| whether it's in a funeral establishment or a separate crematorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| or we can ask our state legislators to try to change the rules of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Let me recognize Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| I have given this a great deal of thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| and I've looked at the potential expansion market of funeral homes within the city limits of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| Assuming that we have about 200,000 people within our city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| we now have 12 funeral homes, so that's one for every 16,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| I've talked to some funeral directors, and generally, they don't anticipate a flurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| or even a minuscule increase in the number of funeral homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| The market's pretty well saturated at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| We have two funeral homes with crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| One actively uses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| The other one has never activated their crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So we are in a situation that we're talking about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| If we have this huge population boom in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| then we may have an increase in the number of funeral homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| But right now, the people who have funeral homes are not having an easy time to continue to stay in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1647)|
| 0:27:35| because obviously there's a demand for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| But the expense of traditional funerals and other things has really caused that industry to rethink how it does its business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| And the projections are that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| there will be a much greater demand for cremations than the traditional funerals that many of us have known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| Probably if we took this council to a little survey, we would find that some of it were pretty evenly divided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| some of us going to be cremated, some of us are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| But my point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| We aren't going to have a huge flurry of new funeral homes within the city limits of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| until we have a significant increase in population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| And, in fact, if anything, we could find one or two existing funeral homes going out of business from lack of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| So the discussion while and changes in the zoning while it is forward thinking down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| based on my conversations and just looking at the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| I'm not seeing that this is going to be a huge issue that is going to come before MPC, this body, licensing, or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1721)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| I want to go back to the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Is your main concern about whether the existing funeral homes are grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1738)|
| 0:29:11| Is that your concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| No, I just raised that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| If they're grandfathered in, every single one of them that's out there, and, like Brenda says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| we ain't going to build a whole bunch more, we're really going to have a very limited effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| And I don't know, maybe I ought to back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Maybe my question is maybe this isn't a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| Maybe we have to have some other ordinance in place if we have the police power that says that anyone that puts one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| things in has got to have something on the stack that monitors what comes out or some setback or some activity that protects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1778)|
| 0:29:48| the breathing public of which we have about 200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| You know, you're going to start a furnace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Right, but we can't, the ones that are, the funeral companies that are out there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| the funeral homes that are out there now, we can't regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| What they're saying is we can't regulate whether they have, they've already been granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Are you arguing whether they're even granted an accessory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| I raised the question of is that set in concrete or is that something that should be examined more closely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| Obviously, the default position is you see that case and you say, oh, my goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| it's part of the general business of being a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And, therefore, since we have a separate state law that says people who have a business can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| and expand it, you know, they're talking about punching out walls and stuff like that, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| that that means that they can add this new item, a furnace, an incinerator, to an existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| Now, there's a case out there by Jingo that seems to be going down that path, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| And, but I wonder, I mean, are we abdicating our role as protectors of the public in making ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| and zoning, which is grouping like activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Where is the data and where is the verifiable data that says these admissions are harmful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1864)|
| 0:31:13| You think they're helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Can you, to what I'm asking, I mean, okay, well, I mean, someone said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| We had a biologist come up here and say that the mercury was small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| I'm not arguing it because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| In amounts individually accumulate in things like water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| But these things have been put in all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Is there somewhere somebody's done a study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| And in the United States, not in Germany, in the United States, it says, and I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| I'm asking the question, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| It says, yes, these things within 200 feet, we've determined if you're within 200 feet that it's harmful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| or if you're within a half a mile or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| I mean, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I'm not asking if it's sarcastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| I'm just saying, where is the data that says that they are harmful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| I mean, yeah, I mean, other than that someone in Germany said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And that's what we, and so we pick a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| I mean, that, what we're trying, I guess what we're here to do, if I understand it right, is put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| are we willing to send it back to MPC to come up with regulations for anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| that would build a new crematorium in the future outside of their existing funeral homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| And so, you know, and I guess, I mean, what we're saying is it's probably not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| it's not like it's a topic that is, I mean, maybe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| Maybe somebody's ready to build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| I think it's healthy that we have something on the books that says what the activity is and how we regulate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| And if it turns out that it applies only to brand new spanking funeral homes that add a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Because if a funeral home, an existing funeral home wanted to expand, and they didn't have the land to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| And there are some out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| I've been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| I've driven around some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| I've kind of overlaid some of these ideas on top of, from my car and thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| It's like, okay, here's a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Well, no, they're way outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| They're outside 200 feet from residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| They're this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| But they may not have any room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| But they may decide it's such a good business model that they want to pick up and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| And if they move down the street, yes, then we would be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Whatever, if we're going to decide that, then they would be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| They would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| If they adopted a new site, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| And there's some that could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| I mean, you know, so I don't think it's totally irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| But I'm just, those are my kind of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Let me just add to what you said a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Let me recognize Councilman Catt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| He had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Well, she may answer what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| But I think it would be very prudent to go ahead and set something for new funeral homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| That's what we're here for tonight, I think, for not the grandfathered end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| But, you know, the particulate and the pollutants and the air quality issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| the first time we met about this was, you know, I'd say it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| as you go forth and look at the local, state, and even federal regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| and you start trying to find, you know, what is acceptable, what is it healthy, is it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| I've heard conflicting things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| grilling out on your charcoal grill is, you know, less or more toxic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| It would be nice to have someone in air quality from the county, from the state, EPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| I don't know who, but to tell us, hey, this isn't so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| It's not going to affect residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I just want some concrete answers on the science and the air quality issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| And I think that would might, you know, be good for us to hear when dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| But I agree with Nick Della Volpe that, you know, if someone's putting an incinerator in a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| that totally changes, I think, the impact on the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| If there's not a human health risk, then we need to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| But, yes, tonight I think we're here just to discuss future establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Sorry for interrupting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| What I was going to say is related to the grandfathering question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| I think that the existing funeral homes, we've taken the position that they would be grandfathered to add this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| But that is a facts-intensive question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| If an existing funeral home actually came and submitted an application to add one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| it would be reviewed to determine if, in fact, they are grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| which we're assuming for purposes that they're an existing funeral home, that they've continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| They would have to make we would have to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| The city would confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| And then the other question is the one limit that is in the state's grandfathering statute is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| if they have sufficient room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And they would have to have enough room to add whatever it is they're planning to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| And they can't acquire a new property in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| So if they moved or if they bought the adjacent property, then they could not expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| So that is a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| So if they didn't have the two or 400 feet separation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| No, because you're talking about the new ordinance that's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| That we would have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| But, no, they would be grandfathered to add the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| What I'm saying is that if they wanted to build a 1,000-foot space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| they could not acquire additional property in order to build that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Let me recognize Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Yes, I think it would be good to get some data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Councilman Wallace mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| And if we could get --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| I'm not suggesting another workshop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| But if we could get some written data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| Councilman DellaVolpe, you mentioned that we had a biologist that came and spoke on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| I remember someone in the audience saying that there was a portion of the mercury would become methyl mercury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| And I don't know that from Adam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| But he said that it was cumulative and that it would have an impact over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Well, I think it would be good if we could get some quote-unquote expert information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| written information that could be distributed to us at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| I know I'm tending to think that it would be rather harmful if most of the neighborhoods do not want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2231)|
| 0:37:20| What is, in terms of the cremations that are getting very popular now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| where are most of the cremations being done and handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| In Knoxville, there are, in Knoxville and surrounding areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| 19 facilities are using the place in Maryville that's in an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| They take, you know, the corpse there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| They process it through the crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| They bring the urn-type remains back for the funeral service or to give to the family to scatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| And so, in fact, some of them have even, I was told, had even partnered with the company down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| so that they pay some part of the cost to be a participant in that industrial facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| Let me recognize Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I was just going to say that, Mark, you sent out a memo to MPC on March 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| And there on page four, you talk about NSAFE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Yeah, or it was in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| And it's a report, George, from the November 2011 study by NSAFE titled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| Assessment of Proposed Crematory Emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| That would be a document that you can take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| It talks about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| Mark, who are those folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| They're a company out of Nashville that does environmental review, engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2320)|
| 0:38:50| And they actually did two studies for the city of Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| The September 2011 one titled, Area Emissions from Potential Spring Hill Crematory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| and then a November study of that same year titled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Assessment of Proposed Crematory Emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| Both of those are available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| And I've got copies of them with me here if you want me to make copies of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| distribute them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I'll go back to Angela, what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| So as I've driven around and looked at some of these funeral homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| and kind of overlaid some of these ideas and looked at it just from a very, you know, a very fast glance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| But some, it doesn't look like to me, based on what I can see out there about their property lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| I didn't go too far, but some people probably don't have the capacity to add on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| And so if they bought adjoining property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| then they would come under this new proposed ordinance that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| They can only build what they have room to build on the existing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| And if they built anything, then they'd still have to have, I mean, if they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| well, we're going to eliminate parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Well, they'd still have to conform to the parking spaces and all that stuff, just like they normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| I can imagine a situation just for totally hypothetical purposes here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| If someone wanted to reduce their parking spaces and they needed a variance, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| they would have to come to VZA and there would be a public hearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| And so, theoretically, it would be possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| but they would have to go through some extra steps in order to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| But the one thing that they cannot do is acquire additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| And that's dependent on the time of the application when they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| They'd have to have their property in hand before they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Before they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Well, it's actually at the time of the regulation comes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I mean, I think that's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| I mean, that right there is a pretty big hurdle for some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| They're pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| They've bought the minimum amount of property that they need, and they don't have a lot of excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| I think the other comment I wanted to make to Mark, if I understood it right, I may have missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| Right now, funeral homes are allowed in 01, C1, C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| 01, C3, C4, and C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| C4 and C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| Is it possible, I mean, under that, if I want to, if I had their, if the zoning was already in place, would I have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2483)|
| 0:41:32| I wouldn't, would I have to, if 01, so if I had an 01 zoning I wanted to put in a funeral home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| I would not necessarily have to submit or would I have to submit a floor plan or a drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| and go ahead and designate space if I wanted to add a crematorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| How can we, I guess that's what I'm getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I mean, how can we make it where they have to announce that to us up front, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| What can we put in place that they'd have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| Would it be a use on review or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| That's what we tried to do with our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| But those four zone districts are all basic zone districts which require no further review by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2527)|
| 0:42:16| other than a site plan review in a C6 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| So in that, in a C6 zone, if they were expanding their footprint, we would have a chance to look at it with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| landscaping and parking and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| If you have the zone, that's one box you check off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| You still have the other steps to go through, your parking, your lot coverage, your setbacks, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| But that's one thing for you to check off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| So just because you have the zone because of the size of what you're wanting to do or what you're planning to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| that's not automatic at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| You have the other exercise to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| I'm trying to get it to where the applicant would have to declare when he submitted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| and he would have the right to review it against, okay, you're going to put in this type of burner and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| As we've been discussing the expansion of crematoriums to existing funeral homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| or at least that to me is where this conversation seems to be drifting, I think we need to factor in the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| It's very expensive to put in a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| It's not as inexpensive as adding a new viewing parlor or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| And if you are in that business, you have to figure out how long it's going to take you to recover the cost of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2617)|
| 0:43:45| So if every funeral home within the city limits of Knoxville decided tonight that they were going to install a crematorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2625)|
| 0:43:53| it would take them quite some time to recover their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| And I think that we need to look at the fact that this is a business, whether that makes us comfortable or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| to view it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| And so expanding and adding a crematorium, in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| it must be cost effective to the funeral operator to send the body to another location rather than having it on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2649)|
| 0:44:19| At the same time, we need to look at the people we're representing who might be end users of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| because there is a cost involved, whether you're cremated or your body is handled in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2665)|
| 0:44:34| And I think that in looking at crematoriums, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| I don't think these are going to spring up in every funeral home, whether they have space to put one or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| simply because the cost is prohibitive and the recovery time to gain that investment back would be very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| And I think that probably we could be looking more at consolidation of existing funeral homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| or the disappearance of some simply because the cost of doing business is becoming prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| for the customer base to pay for that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| I was just listening to what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| I think what's happening in the industry right now is that companies are buying other sites that already exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| and they're becoming little mini-conglomerates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| That's how they're managing their business, and so that's one way of dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| I just wanted to go back, and I'm off this trail completely, but there's one point I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| You know, if we had a guy that was in the put tires on your truck business or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| and he decided he wanted to expand his business to start smelting rubber in the backyard to make tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| is that the same business or is that a different one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| I just think this framework we're starting from is a little bit stilted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| I mean, the fact that funeral directors are licensed to not only do autopsy type body preparation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| or embalming but also cremation doesn't necessarily mean that the physical location warrants that kind of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| But that being said, let's concentrate on the words and the magic that we're doing here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| Policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| I want to ask a question and then make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Basically what we're saying is that the path that we're headed down is that we have no control over the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| funeral homes in terms of whether or not they want to have a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Does it require, for instance, we know we have two crematoriums in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| One's active and one isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Does a crematorium, if it's an accessory use, does it have to be joined to the existing funeral home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| In other words, the one that we're talking about that's inactive is not at the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| It's in a warehouse up on the cemetery lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| So is that a different animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Is that a different situation than what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| If you are referring to the one that I'm thinking of, I believe that that one is its own unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| At Highland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Yeah, at Highland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| At Highland Memorial, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| I think that one probably has a few little extra facts in it that are different from the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| But there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| It was not approved as an accessory use to the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| It was specifically approved as an accessory use to the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| And that is a distinction that was done under years and years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| I do not know that the city of Knoxville, looking at that situation today, would consider that in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| We would just have to look at that if it ever presented itself again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| So if a cemetery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Not the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| The city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| So if a cemetery came to you today and wanted to do one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| I don't know how we would look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| How that would be regulated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| So that's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| That's not the issue that's ever been presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| I just know that that's in the record on that specific property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| And then the other thing I think that we need to realize, and, George, you brought this up about looking at the different funeral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| homes around town, remember, to do a crematorium, you don't have to build outside the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| I mean, if someone decides they're going to take their chapel and put a crematorium in there and burn bodies 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| you know, they have that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| You don't necessarily, you know, have to think that not all the funeral homes in Knoxville could not have a crematorium if they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| you know, if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| So you just adapted this existing space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| Just use the existing space in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| But, again, what we're saying, though, is that the existing funeral homes that exist in Knoxville right now can have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| And so what we're really looking at is the future in terms of a new funeral home or a crematorium in terms of the ordinance that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Yeah, just following up just a moment on Nick Delafope's last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| If someone comes in and buys an existing funeral home, is that a new business or is that now an existing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2947)|
| 0:49:16| That's a continuation of the existing use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| I haven't thought that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| We want to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| I think we need to get on to the eating the coconut here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2963)|
| 0:49:34| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| What are you looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| What are you looking for, Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| I'll stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| I mean, Mr. Frost brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| Well, there are a few issues council needs to talk about and give some guidance to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| We talked about the different zones where these may be allowed, may not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| We talked about the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Fountain City Town Hall was advocating 2,640 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| MPC said 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| We were putting out there for discussion perhaps 400 or 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| And the idea of, you know, some folks have talked about a monitoring of the number of cremations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3013)|
| 0:50:22| versus the number of traditional funeral services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| You know, we thought maybe we should try to get away with that, get away from that because of the enforcement, the licensing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3025)|
| 0:50:37| having more to enforce versus limit on the front end to have a single cremation unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3037)|
| 0:50:49| and have the amount of the floor space limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| Those are the topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Let me interrupt it because as you go on to those, I'm not going to remember all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| But let's take the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Can we not just say that crematoriums or funeral homes, well, I guess crematoriums are what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| They only happen in an I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Well, if you're talking a stand-alone crematorium, you can say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| I mean, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| What do we say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| What's the proposal right now for a stand-alone crematorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| The Planning Commission recommended a crematory as a use on review within the four industrial zone districts, I-1, I-2, I-3, and I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3080)|
| 0:51:31| And their reason was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| Why all four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Because they're industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| And with the use on review, you would have site plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| and the ability to condition those to reflect any particular circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3102)|
| 0:51:53| Refresh me with, in an I-1, what other types of sort of give me a breakdown of I-1, I-2, I-3 and I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3113)|
| 0:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3123)|
| 0:52:13| Heavy industrials in I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| I don't know why we'd make it more lenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| I mean, I-1 is the planned industrial district, and you basically name your uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3139)|
| 0:52:28| and there is site plan approval already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| I-2 is called the restricted manufacturing and warehouse district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| and includes a whole lot of bottling and packaging works, manufacturing, manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3159)|
| 0:52:51| wholesaling, warehousing, and has the generic other uses of same general character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3171)|
| 0:53:01| I-3 is called the general industrial district and includes all of the uses allowed in I-1 and I-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3181)|
| 0:53:12| and further expands specifically the number of manufacturing and assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3192)|
| 0:53:21| and treatment operations, including automobile assembling, blacksmith shop and machine shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3201)|
| 0:53:33| foundries, and a generic processing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| And then I-4 is the heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Mark, for instance, would an I-1 be adjacent to a residential zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3223)|
| 0:53:51| Are any of these separations such that, for instance, we may not want a crematorium in an I-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| because it is adjacent to a residential neighborhood as opposed to an I-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| Is there any distinction there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| The general description of the I-1 is that it's intended to be located between light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| or heavy industrial areas and residential areas or in locations which are served by major roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| but are not feasible for light or heavy industrial developments because of proximity to residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| But as a planned district, the planning commission has development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3265)|
| 0:54:33| and can attach conditions such as distance and buffering and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3273)|
| 0:54:44| Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| It seems like the zoning up to I-3 and I-4 would be more the use-owner view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| Like you say, when you have a distributor, something like Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| something over off Bomb Drive that's near neighborhoods and residential areas, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| that would definitely or should be maybe a use-owner view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| But once you get into I-3 and I-4, other than you think about over at Lonsdale and Grinnell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| that's probably what an I-3 or I-4, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| I think that's I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| So, you know, we have an industrial, heavy industrial right near neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| So it's, you know, maybe use-owner view needs to go through the whole process in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3318)|
| 0:55:32| Can I be recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| I mean, I think we all know why we're here is that we're concerned about the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| So I just think would it be appropriate with council's approval we could hear from some of our neighborhood reps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Well, it would take a we're still under council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| So if you wanted to, I mean, we could certainly open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| If you all wanted to make a motion to deviate from this agenda, I would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3355)|
| 0:56:05| I'd be happy just to speak to I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| But still we've got to follow the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| So I would move to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| All those in favor of the suspension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I'm here representing Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| I just want to make it clear that I speak only for Fountain City Town Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| not for any other group, not for Fountain City Community Awareness Network or any other organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| Speaking specifically, and I know you all received our information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| specifically speaking about freestanding crematoria and industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| We think they should be limited to I-4s at use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| And let me say why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| We always hear how, especially if the economy gets going again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| we need more and more industrial land, industrially zoned land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| to attract businesses and manufacturing, assembly, whatever, to our city and to our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3431)|
| 0:57:20| And I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| We have four zones in industrial, and I think for good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| If you put an incinerator, a crematorium, in an I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, or I-1 through I-3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3445)|
| 0:57:37| even as a use on review, every time, let me warn you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| every time someone comes in with a request for an I-1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| someone opposing it is going to be saying, you can put a crematorium in there with use on review approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| and if it meets the standard, you've got to let it be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| Deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| As we've heard, we're looking at the potential of one or two in 20 years, next 20 years perhaps, freestanding crematoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3477)|
| 0:58:07| Why would you risk an anchor around your neck in future rezonings for good industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3487)|
| 0:58:16| that don't interfere with neighborhoods by opening four industrial zones up to a crematory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Not to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Not from a governance standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| Also, if you look at the various general descriptions, let's go I-1 says it's areas near residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3510)|
| 0:58:41| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| Let's go to I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| I-3 says what's prohibited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| An incinerator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| Distillation of bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| That's specifically prohibited in I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| I suggest, as we've put in writing, the place for a freestanding crematorium is in an I-4 as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3540)|
| 0:59:09| One of the things that does is protect the integrity, the general descriptions in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| and gives our community the opportunity to have good industrial companies come to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3557)|
| 0:59:28| And, frankly, I think it gets rid of a lot of headaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Councilman Grady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Well, as far as the first thing you're talking about, then, Rob, is that what I'd like to do, I suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| is make a motion that we only allow crematoriums, freestanding crematoriums, in an I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| Are we just asking for recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| We're not asking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| You can't legislate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| You can just talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| I'm in favor of only having standalone crematoriums in an I-4, not only for the reasons that Ms. Malone discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| but I just think that it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| This is the policy part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| I mean, this is what Attorney Frost was telling us on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| These are the things that we're going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Are you talking about allowing them as a right or a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Use on review in an I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I'm also in favor of limiting it to an I-4, and it's a permitted use now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3627)|
| 1:00:35| So, I mean, but anyway, I think you don't allow it in 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| With a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| Do we move on to the second issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| I mean, well, okay, but we also need to have the discussion about funeral establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| with the understanding that funeral establishments may have crematoriums made as part of the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3658)|
| 1:01:08| and what types of zones they're going to be allowed as a right or not allowed or allowed as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| Right now, funeral establishments are allowed in O-1, C-3, C-4, and C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3675)|
| 1:01:25| Automatically allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| You know, they're not allowed in residentially zoned areas right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| You know, it's not for me to assume anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| Does council want to continue with not allowing them in residentially zoned areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| The next question is, you know, you have some transitional zones that are oftentimes when development comes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3705)|
| 1:01:54| and goes down a corridor, you put these transitional zones between your more intense uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| your commercial uses, and as you go back off those streets, you get into neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| And, you know, some can say transitional zones are C-1 zone and C-1, O-1 and C-1 zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3726)|
| 1:02:14| Others might want to include other zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| Question for council, policy question is, do you want to, you know, first, what do you define as your transitional zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| And then, second, do you want to allow funeral establishments, not allow funeral establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3744)|
| 1:02:31| or only allow funeral establishments as part of a use on review public process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| That's the next policy question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| So let me see just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| If you allow a funeral establishment in the zones you just mentioned, once that is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| then if they choose to build a crematorium with it, we can't stop that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| We're talking new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| What the proposal does is actually set some standards for the crematoriums that could be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| So, yes, is the answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| You can add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| But you would be adding facilities for a cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| Instead of a crematorium standalone, it would be an accessory crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| It would not be a freestanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| It would be subject to the standards that are set up also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I guess, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| I think what I was trying to ask is if we, in other words, could we say, okay, you can have a funeral home here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| but you cannot have a crematorium attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| If it's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| That's all we're talking about here is something that does not now exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| You can do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| Yes, I mean, because that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| In other words, any new funeral home that comes in, you say you cannot have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| Well, no, I mean, we're defining where these new things can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| If we say it could go in an O-1, for instance, but we'll only allow a funeral home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| not a funeral home that has an accessory use of a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| You can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| No, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| If you look at the Mount Juliet case, the court of appeals clearly said that the cremation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| a crematory is a complementary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| I think that answers my question, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| But I'm on the same path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| I mean, if you do a use on review, you'd have to declare that up front, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| That's what you'd have to say this was going to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Or you'd have to just know or assume it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| That's what you'd have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| You'd have to assume that they're going to have a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| And you'd have to approve use on review based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| And I think that's a reason why you'd want a use on review because you could decide there could be an O-1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| that you wouldn't want to put a crematorium in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| And you're going to have to assume that they're going to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| You've got to be thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Now, because of this Mount Juliet case, when we're talking for this point of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| when we're talking about funeral establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| New ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| New ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Also, thinking there, you're talking funeral establishments with a crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| You're planning for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| Can I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| I thought that Mark's approach was to, in picking the zones where you could do the funeral establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| to say that if you want to add as an accessory activity the crematorium, it then meets certain standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| I suppose you could put that in the main section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| Or you could have it as a use on review with a submission of plans and plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| Now, there was a debate that Fountain City raised about whether it's in there or not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| I mean, can it be part of an allowed use and still have some accessory control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| Or do you define the terms differently somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| To address what Finbar was saying, which is you can have a funeral establishment in, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| 01, but if you want to, but the addition or use of a crematory has a plan submission phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3967)|
| 1:06:15| That was the tough question we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| We either got to pick very restricted zones where they can only go here and we have some criteria for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| or we have it in a broad number of zones, but they have to have some kind of plan submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| Well, part of the policy considerations for council tonight is also the distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| and the footprint that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| This 33 percent kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| And then or then there's the, you know, the licensing and monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4003)|
| 1:06:50| and enforcement procedure that, you know, has been originally suggested by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4010)|
| 1:07:00| So, I mean, when we're talking funeral establishments, for purposes of which zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| you also need to be having in the back of your mind this funeral establishment could also have a crematorium as part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| So, therefore, do you want to allow it in these specific types of zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4033)|
| 1:07:21| Vice Mayor Pavlis had to step out to take a radio interview, not on crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4041)|
| 1:07:29| So, I guess I'm chairing the meeting by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Ms. Malone, Claire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Anybody want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| So, let's see if she can do it, number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Carly Malone, 6051 Fountain Road for Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| You know, thinking simply, okay, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4066)|
| 1:07:56| An accessory use is a permitted use and, therefore, it's awkward at best and crazy to have it be a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4076)|
| 1:08:07| So, you can't really have a crematorium as an accessory use to a funeral home and have a use on review for the crematorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| So, we regulate the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| One of the things I believe MPC was trying to do was be responsive to people who showed up with concerns about crematoria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4098)|
| 1:08:30| to provide a way to have a public meeting because the public wanted a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| So, we're not taken by surprise that a crematory is coming in down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| The way to solve, in my opinion, all these problems is to make the funeral home a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| When you have a funeral home as a use on review, they can go to MPC and submit their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| If they're going to have a crematorium, it will be on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| There's a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| If they're not going to have a crematorium, it won't be on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| There will still be a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| If 10 years down the road, two years down the road, they want a crematorium, they go and amend their use on review request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4144)|
| 1:09:13| I think it solves all kinds of problems, keeps the ordinance intact as far as making a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4153)|
| 1:09:22| which is a special use under the law, required of a permitted use, which is awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4162)|
| 1:09:33| Take the whole category and drop it under use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| Funeral establishment becomes a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Just pick the zones you can go in, but you drop it down one notch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| I'm of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| And I think it solves the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| There's a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| You know what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| You can put conditions on it within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| That sounds good to me because 01, you'd be really, I'd be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| It's use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| So you're saying for 01?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| All of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| So it would be all the way through, no matter what zone it is, use on review, all the way to I-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| It's a use on review use, not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| So it's a, okay, we'll make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| Residentially zoned areas, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| The ones we talked about, 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Office, commercial, industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| No, C-3, 4, and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| That's what we're in, 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| That's the four zones we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| What's C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Is it in or out in that list now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| 01, C-3, C-4, C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Are uses on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| General establishments are use on review in those four zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| What about C-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| I thought that wasn't in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| They're not allowed now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| I'm not adding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| Can I suspend the role of rules again in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Jamie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| I just ask you to really think hard about putting them in 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| Do you have a chance to do something really nice and good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| and forward thinking for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| You could take 01 out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| 01 right now is a transition zone into almost all neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| And a use on review, that sounds really good and really, you know, difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| If they meet the standards, you can't turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| And 90 plus percent of use on reviews are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| So please keep that in mind and take the 01 out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| I can see cases where 01 would not be smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Let me ask Mr. Donaldson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| I mean, is there a pretty good likelihood of 01 is going to bump up or be contiguous to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| residential zone area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| It's actually in the description of 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| The last sentence says the intent is to provide centralized compact locations for business offices, clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4348)|
| 1:12:36| medical and dental offices, as well as suburban locations near residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| I'm hearing that 01, we're going to remove the possibility of a funeral establishment going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4363)|
| 1:12:52| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| I think, yeah, I mean, considering the 15 or 19, I forgot what Ms. Palmer said, that are the grandfathered in ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| Mostly in 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| So, you know, any restrictions, tighter restrictions we place on new facilities is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| we've already got grandfathered in ones that are going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| whether any tighter regulations come forth in the future, you know, we can set it pretty harsh, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| or should I say restrictive for future funeral home establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| I actually have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| I don't know if, Mark, you know the answer to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| How many of our funeral homes are in office 01?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| I would say the majority of them, but I don't know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| You know, anecdotally, a lot of the funeral establishments are in large, older homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| Those are typically adjacent to other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| And I think traditionally they have used the 01 zone district to establish the funeral home in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4432)|
| 1:14:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| I hadn't really thought about this too much, so I'm sort of thinking out loud here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| because we need to think about this as a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| And I don't know where the funeral homes are going into more commercial areas now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| When was the last funeral home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| That's just the way development took off down Broadway and Kingston Pike was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| it went slowly out into residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| You think about, you know, some along Broadway and, you know, but now I think it's along Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| it's a lot easier to get a C3 zoning, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Like in a strip mall, funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| Whether they're on big parcels of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| I'm just thinking out loud here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| If you had one today, they're on big parcels of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| I knew one went out on Middlebrook Pike out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| And it's on a big track of land, you know, because you've got to have parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| They have a chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| You have a lot of, you know, I mean, there's just other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| Because, I mean, I'm fine with taking them out of 01 too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| I don't know where that industry is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| If you're a funeral home tycoon, where you open up shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| Just thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| I mean, I'm just thinking because we don't want to stop all funeral homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| Let me reel this back in one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| The funeral home that Councilman Wallace referred to is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| It is not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| On Western Avenue is a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| And I'm not sure what zone it is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| But I do know there's not a residential area nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Councilman Campen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Is that a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| I mean, just what Marshall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| I don't think we're too concerned about more funeral homes being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| I think it's, you know, the fact that, as Brenda said, a lot of them or a few may be closing because of the lack of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| As we go forward and set that, yeah, 01 taking it out is, I think, appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| So, we're going down the path of taking 01 out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| Let me just, I want to make sure that everybody's on the same page going forward when this goes back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| We're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| There are going to be uses on review in I-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| They're not going to be allowed in I-1, 2, or 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Everybody so far so good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| They are not going to be allowed in 01 and C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| Now we're talking about funeral establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| And they will be uses on review in C-3, C-4, and C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4590)|
| 1:16:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| I thought Mark indicated that C-4 and C-6 came as any use permitted in C-3 you could have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4601)|
| 1:16:49| That's kind of one of those all-inclusive catch-alls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| You put it in C-3, it just drops into C-4 and C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| C-4 and C-6 refer to those uses permitted in C-3, which is where it's listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| So, if you stick it in C-3, it drops into C-4 and C-6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| Well, if we move it to uses permitted on review in C-3, then we'll have to make a corresponding adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| In C-4 and C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| So, we're all in agreement about the types of the shalls and the shall nots and the maybes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Well, an MPC obviously might rethink some part of that when they get down to the nuts and bolts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| but that would be our recommendation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| They would like for you to attend their meeting and talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| We have MPC's initial recommendation of 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| Then we have the Fountain City Town Hall, 2640 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| And then Angela, Mark, and I talked about 400 to 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| And I thought that was a good distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4677)|
| 1:18:06| I told Attorney Frost I bet it was 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| Well, there's nothing that says that it's safer at 500 than there is at 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| I mean, you're just picking an arbitrary number, but, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| Some of the data just shows a diminishing slope as you move away from the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| There was a change in the degree of slope 50 meters out in the one study that I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4706)|
| 1:18:34| It's gradually diminishing as you go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| 500 feet from a resident, a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| From the facility, the stack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| The center of the stack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| The emissions diminish as you move away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| So the farther you move away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| But he's saying where do you measure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Where do you measure to and what are we measuring against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Measure that from the center of the stack in a radius out from there from a park, a residence, or a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4732)|
| 1:19:01| So is it a church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Or a daycare center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Or a daycare center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| It's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| I mean, what is you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| So it's not property boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| It's just from the stack to how far the nearest activity that we just described, sensitive activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| And if council wants MPC to consider additional other uses that it has to have a distance from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| this is the time to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| I think a daycare center is very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| I think if you look at most air pollution and OSHA type studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| you find that very young children are most affected by fine particles and then typically very old folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4787)|
| 1:19:55| But, I mean, they have susceptibility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| So protecting them is a legitimate municipal concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4798)|
| 1:20:06| Well, make a motion that we permanently suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4806)|
| 1:20:18| Yeah, wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| Your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| The way it is presently written by MPC, it is from the building to the building of a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4823)|
| 1:20:32| It is not to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| So it is 200 feet from building to building, from stack to building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| If that's your kid's bedroom window, you're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Kids are more sensitive to pollutants and spend a lot of time in the bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| And God forbid they keep the window open or they just have air flow problems in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| So we would suggest more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| Now, with parks and so on, the recommendation is to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| It's not to the property line for residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| It's building to building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| So I suggest this be looked at very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| We understand, as has been pointed out, that the half mile distance is legally suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4873)|
| 1:21:22| As great a distance as can be adopted as possible to be protective of the adjoining adjacent nearby uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4882)|
| 1:21:33| There's no question there are pollutants put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| I'm not a scientist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| I don't know how detrimental they are, but many of them are the kinds of things that remain in your body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4897)|
| 1:21:47| or remain in the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| They don't have quick half-lives and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| So as much consideration as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| And where you measure from, as has been discussed, is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Are you saying property line or building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| What's the right tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| I guess I would say the farthest possible, which would be property line to property line rather than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| I mean, which would be from the stack to another property line, not to the bedroom window, not to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| Arlene, how did you come up with the distance that you folks recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| There were a number of us who worked together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| It was a cooperative project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| The half mile was suggested as, I think, just as much as anyone could ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| We didn't feel we had, and this was to the discussion, we were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| it was pointed out that we don't want to just pick a number, you know, be arbitrary about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| which is why we had in there as an alternative to a distance a modeling using EPA models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4966)|
| 1:22:57| And I'm sorry, Mr. Kurth is out of town, couldn't be here, because he is the one who has scientific background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| It's very clear I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| He suggested there be a distance requirement, and rather than just pick an arbitrary number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| if somebody's up on the mountain versus down in a valley, air movement is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| And just as one presents to NPC and city engineering when they're trying to get a building permit, a drainage model, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=4998)|
| 1:23:28| they present an air model to show what kind of disbursement you should expect of pollutants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5008)|
| 1:23:37| emissions on that specific site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Up on a hill, down in a valley might be very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| And, again, you know, I apologize for Mr. Kurth not being here and for being totally dumb on this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| We're closing in on an hour and a half here, so I want to really, first off, I want to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| Angela, you got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| I do have a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| Can you tell us how you arrived at the measurements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| how NPC arrived at its measurement for residential property for the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| I didn't ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| I understand the distance, but I was wondering if how it was property lot, property lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| or building to building instead of property lot to property lot for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| Well, the emissions model was part of the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| There also was a consideration of the typical lot pattern that we have for the existing funeral establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5071)|
| 1:24:44| And we were trying to limit their future facilities to accessory through a use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5084)|
| 1:24:57| So we took into consideration the size of the lots of the existing facilities that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| and they're not on parcels that would allow a half mile or a 500-foot separation distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5102)|
| 1:25:12| So the 200-foot distance reflects that existing condition as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| For example, cell towers, we deal with them a lot as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| And I don't know which way is which, but the county does it one way and the city does it the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5126)|
| 1:25:33| One uses the distance from a residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| and the other uses the distance from the property of a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| So we could go either way on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| As you shift to the property line, you could shorten that separation distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Yeah, I wonder if we couldn't pick a distance that's a little bit larger, like the 400 or 500 feet, say, from a property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5153)|
| 1:26:02| and then put kind of a less clause that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| unless sufficient modeling is shown that, you know, the normal dispersion patterns would not affect a closer structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| In other words, they would have to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| and demonstrate by modeling or whatever that is not going down the hill to Bubba's house kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| I mean, that's certainly an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| I mean, they would have some study commission, like a traffic study, done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5185)|
| 1:26:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| They'd have an absolute guide, but if they wanted less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| they'd have to do a study to show us why it's still okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| I mean, that's possible, but then, you know, you get into the battle of the experts, and then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| I mean, which some neighborhoods engage in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| then what happens if you have a neighborhood that doesn't have the financial wherewithal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| I mean, that's just devil's advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| But, I mean, that's one possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Well, the other way is to get some medical people to say what a safe distance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| We don't have the people here to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| But, I mean, that's obviously the other approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| But, you know, I have seen other states and locations have 400, 600, even 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5230)|
| 1:27:18| I mean, they pick numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Now, I don't know what the basis was, but if you start Googling crematory regulations, you'll see that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5239)|
| 1:27:27| And the question is, what's a reasonable number that provides sufficient protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| I don't have a problem with a safety valve that says if you can show a lesser distance, then, you know, bring it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| You're saying maybe that always goes in favor of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| I don't know, but you could have just a flat number then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| And then I suppose the other approach is if you don't have a safety valve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| they would go to the BZA and ask for some relief on why they can't get that kind of distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| I guess that's always the other safety valve is a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Councilman Campin, did you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Well, I just, I mean, again, we don't know what's safe and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| And so it really makes it hard for us to make a decision on the distance, you know, 500 minimum, 750, 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5292)|
| 1:28:20| I mean, it's really hard to make that decision tonight because we don't know what is safe or unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| It would be nice to have that scientific data, something to support or refute our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| But, again, I mean, I would throw out there 500 minimum at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| And if anybody wants to give me 500, give me 750, I mean, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| We've got to put something down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| 500, 500, 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| We can suggest something, I mean, for them to start formulating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| What about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Framing it for, I mean, MPC's already looked at different studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5337)|
| 1:29:04| Ask MPC to look at the, you know, I don't know how many studies they looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| and see if they've got a basis that would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| Because you also want to give the people who, you know, may live in proximity of these places, you want to give them some security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5354)|
| 1:29:24| A margin of safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| A margin of safety, exactly, where, you know, I don't know if MPC can find something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| You know, they might find something where 300 feet, that's all that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| But also they might find something that, you know, 400 feet or 500 feet gives people a greater peace of mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5374)|
| 1:29:44| where they would be comfortable in their own homes or at the schools or at the neighborhood parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5384)|
| 1:29:53| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Are we going boundary line or structure to structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| Well, the one study that we do have by NSAFE for Spring Hill actually considered a site-specific case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5399)|
| 1:30:07| and this particular example that they deemed to be safe, the stack is about 500 feet from the nearest residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5407)|
| 1:30:18| Structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5419)|
| 1:30:19| And maybe 400 feet from the nearest residential property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| I think there is something to be said for the distinction of East Tennessee, which Ms. Malone alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| and that is if you had the funeral establishment on the hill and the house on the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| the distance is going to be, it's going to slough down to that valley and hit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| So I could see where some sites would be more sensitive, but 500 sounds like a reasonable number to suggest to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5438)|
| 1:30:47| and then let them look further if there's some evidence that changes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| The last one, the MPC and a little bit, the Fountain City Town Hall suggestion on the monitoring issue, it established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5456)|
| 1:31:06| I'm kind of blending them together, but, you know, there would be a licensing procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5466)|
| 1:31:14| a reporting procedure to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| You know, there would be a, you know, you can only have X number of cremations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| only if you did Y number of traditional funeral services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| And in talking about these things, we'd respectfully submit that it would be kind of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| there should be a difficult layer of bureaucracy which would be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| It might be hard to get those records in some regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| For example, death certificates are specifically exempted from the Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| I mean, there are certain things that the state legislature has determined should not be open to the public birth records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5509)|
| 1:31:58| is another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| What, you know, we were suggesting, we were taking into account, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5520)|
| 1:32:07| part of what MPC's recommendation was, was to limit that the floor area devoted to facilities for cremation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5527)|
| 1:32:16| be less than one-third of the total floor area for the funeral establishment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| And the second one, which is one we discussed, which also Fountain City Town Hall submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5543)|
| 1:32:32| was that there would be a single cremation unit with at least two combustion chambers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| and a final emissions burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| The idea is if you have two cremation units, it's, you're probably getting more into of a, your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5561)|
| 1:32:51| Industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| Well, your accessory uses, your tail's wagging your dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| So on the front end, we're saying you can have one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| And that's a way on the front end going in, you're addressing that they have one unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| and you're also framing the size of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| Can you require scrubbers on the smokestack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| I would think you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| My understanding is that that's already required by state regulations anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| And I know that there is a lot of dispute over that, but I think that that's something that the department of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5608)|
| 1:33:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| I think we'd actually have to research that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| I mean, when it was put in, it didn't have scrubbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| It doesn't have it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| It just has a burn center and then a second place, like an after burner to kind of pick up some of the stuff that got by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5628)|
| 1:33:56| I suppose we could have a requirement that when they make their use and review submission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| they show what facilities or techniques or controls they're using to minimize emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5641)|
| 1:34:10| In other words, we could make them submit something as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| not only that the device is using some, you know, modern practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| but also that it has devices or controls to minimize emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| But in looking at it from a, you know, maybe this is too narrow of a thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5664)|
| 1:34:33| if they're able to demonstrate that the unit they're putting in is going to comply with air quality standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| if you meet those standards, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| But there is no limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| There's a Ringelman chart kind of limit about how much opacity darkness of the smoke you can get out of the stack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5685)|
| 1:34:53| but there's no limit on any constituent in the air that air pollution control board of Knox County presently enforces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5693)|
| 1:35:03| Their investigation or monitoring is to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| and make sure you kept records of how many burns, how hot it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| and how much opacity came out of the stack kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| One second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| I hate to do this, but we've begun our restoration of our cable plant in Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| And I've got a call that began at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| And I want to let Attorney Frost close the meeting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Rob, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| I feel, oh, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| No, I mean, on the one hand, I feel a little uneasy trying to tell someone how to run their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| and that they, you know, you've got to tell me how many bodies you're taking in and all this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| But on the other hand, can you require certain hours of operations of certain businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5746)|
| 1:35:54| Through our use and review process, we often do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| So it's possible that we could say that the crematorium can only operate during certain hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| which might be something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| But, again, I really feel uneasy about saying, well, you can only do ten bodies a day or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| And then keep in mind that the zoning ordinance already has performance standards established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| for all commercial and industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| In Article 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Article 5, Section 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| Are we suspending the rules or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| No, I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| I would concur with Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| It's a little bit uneasy about the direction this conversation is going and the degree of regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5800)|
| 1:36:47| I think some of the concerns of the various groups that are in the audience tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| and other places are things that our state legislators need to be addressing as opposed to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| that we're imposing that may or may not conform to state standards that come down the pipe sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5819)|
| 1:37:07| I think that applying a layer of bureaucracy with an agency that's going to license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| and monitor the business of the funeral home is something that we all talk about, taxpayer dollars and spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5833)|
| 1:37:22| And I'm not sure that that's something that the overwhelming number of taxpayers are as concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| So I'm very, very concerned about how much regulation we're talking about as far as the operation of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5850)|
| 1:37:38| establishments compared to other businesses we have in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| Yeah, I agree with you, Councilwoman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| and also want to support at least the considerations that have been put forward as far as two chambers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| one burner and one-third or less of the building size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| But a question is how is it monitored, you know, short of putting that level of bureaucracy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5879)|
| 1:38:07| How is it monitored that it is an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| Who says that, you know, bodies aren't brought in and they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| using it around the clock versus how many funeral, you know, things happen there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5896)|
| 1:38:26| You know, who is monitoring that guarantees it is an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5906)|
| 1:38:35| I'd like to recognize Mr. O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| The building inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| I mean, no one's actually submitting from the funeral home a spreadsheet that says we did 54 this month or 97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5921)|
| 1:38:51| So, you know, we really don't know how many they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| But, again, I mean, that's maybe another night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| But I think I would just like to support what the considerations that were put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| And I think that that is one of the concerns that Mr. Frost mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| is that there are practical difficulties in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| I mean, we would have to figure out a way to do that, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| And I don't have an answer for how exactly it would happen in light of the fact that the records are not typically public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5952)|
| 1:39:24| Can I footnote that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| The Section 5 that Mark was talking about has an enforcement provision under C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| And it says, where in the opinion of the building inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| or other designated inspector there is a probable violation of any provision of the section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| he is empowered to have a qualified technician perform such investigations, measurements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| and analysis as may be necessary to determine whether or not there's a violation of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| Upon confirmation, the offending industry has to pay the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| And in that general set of regulations are things like fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=5995)|
| 1:40:01| and, you know, hazardous kinds of toxic and noxious matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| So we have something for at least industrial locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| Maybe that's for all the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| I don't know if it's only for industrial or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| It's a performance standard for any district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| Before issuing a permit in any commercial or industrial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| the building inspector shall be given information by the applicant sufficient to enable said inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| to assure himself that all performance standards are being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| And then the specific standards, the statement is the following regulations shall apply to all industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6033)|
| 1:40:45| We could amend that to include whatever we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| So then we would deal with smoke, odors, and all those other things that would have some standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| I recognize Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Following up on what Mr. DelVolpe just said, I think that's just in industrial zones, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| because that's a problem we've been dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| I think there's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| You need to understand that even if they do just have one unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| if it takes three hours, which is a long time, really, they can do them quicker than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6073)|
| 1:41:19| You're talking over 1,400 in a year if they operate 365 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| and that's what their permits typically allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Speaking to the emission burner, I beg you to put that on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| because in the more modern machines that are coming out, that's what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| and they're doing it for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| If you have the second burner, that's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| but if you don't have an emission burner, you're not taking care of the furans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| and a lot of the other toxins that would come into your air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| Why not require an emission burner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| They should all have an emission burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Only the older machines do not have emission burners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| so that should be a definite requirement for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| because a lot of these bodies are embalmed before they are cremated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6128)|
| 1:42:16| So you've got formaldehyde.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| You've got formalin being formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| You have the mercury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| You have lots and lots of toxins, not just one or two, and no one, no one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| please keep this in mind, in Knox County, in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| no one is monitoring anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| The state is not monitoring anything, emission-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| The city is not monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| The county is not monitoring anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| Please keep that in mind as you go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| I think we're making some good headway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| You know, it's a frustrating issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| and one concern I have is that if we make this so restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| basically what we're going to have is just more crematories at the existing funeral homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6192)|
| 1:43:21| So I just think that's something we should keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| I mean, I'm in favor of keeping them out of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| but if we just make it so restrictive, you know, if I could, if this was Sim City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| I would say let's have one big one in an industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| and they'd do them so cheaply that none of these funeral homes close to neighborhoods would ever want one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| or build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| I mean, ideally, to me, that would be the best scenario, but obviously we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| But it's just something to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| As we make these tougher and tougher on new ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| it's going to make them more appealing to put them in the current funeral homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| that are out there close to neighborhoods, mostly in office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| I have some misgivings also about saying, specifying what type of equipment they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| What I'm interested in is the outcome, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| What is the emission and how is that monitored?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| And regulating that rather than what type of equipment, because the technology changes so rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| If we put in today, by the time something is advanced, then we have restricted future, you know, future enhancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6263)|
| 1:44:33| And we don't think we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| So I'm talking to MPC now because I don't know exactly how to achieve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| and especially given what Ms. Rowe just said, that the monitoring is kind of essential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| that that function is performed and performed accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| And if it's not being performed, then whatever we specify may be academic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| But I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| But, you know, right now there's the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| And what we're trying to do tonight is trying to set some baselines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| And you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Technology can improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Where if we start with the single unit with at least two combustion chambers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| and the final emissions burner, say in 10 years on down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| it might be for future council to say, well, the technology is now this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| Let's amend the standard to that higher standard at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| But we're setting a baseline for 2012 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| Rob, are we ---- I had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| Shine on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Rob, are we ---- let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| We're talking about new funeral home establishments for controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| If man funeral home wants to put a crematory, do they have to follow the new regulations we're putting forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| So we're only talking about ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| There's no equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| And then I'd like to ask where'd Jamie go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| Jamie, what's the difference between the emission that you're talking about and scrubbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| That's a little difficult to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| But if you have scrubbers, it has water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| It's usually wet, usually like if you'll think about the steam plants and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| That brings the stuff back down, the particulates and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| An emission burner will just burn it off right there within a contained area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| Scrubbers are good on things like smokestacks at Y-12, K-25, places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6390)|
| 1:46:40| So the scrubbers aren't really necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| This is not an expensive item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| And like I'm saying, it's the emission burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| The emission burner, then we'd rather have that than the scrubbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| That's kind of a difficult question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| But what I'm saying is don't let them use old technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| At least require them to use the state-of-the-art thing that is out there at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| And an emission burner is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| It's essential if you care about the older people, the babies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| even younger people that don't want this in their kidneys and in their liver and everywhere else to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| And we're talking particulates, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| It's not just necessarily different kind of chemicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| But there's lots and lots of chemicals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| But we're talking particulates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| It's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| But the emission burner would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| And we could say something like best available technology or best current technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I would, to get to Councilman Saunders' point where technology changes and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6469)|
| 1:47:57| I would suggest the two burners plus the emission burner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| which is basically, as I understand it, an afterburner that burns off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| but the other stuff wouldn't burn, doesn't burn off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| and would be ordinarily otherwise going into the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| So you have two chambers burning, and then you have the afterburner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| And include in there something that says, and best available technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| I would also like to take a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| It was mentioned as an accessory to a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| And that's more and more becoming a common practice in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| And I would suggest if we haven't handled that in this, this would be a good time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6512)|
| 1:48:40| And I do believe that this takes care of that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| or this proposal does clearly define what a crematory is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| and it defines what an accessory facility would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| But I do, again, that's something that was done a long, long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6533)|
| 1:49:01| But that would mean you have to put a cemetery in an I-4 zone or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| No, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| That determination was made that it's being an accessory to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| That's something that's not been presented to anyone recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| That decision was made well over 20, 25 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| Right, but looking at the material on crematoria and trends in cremation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6561)|
| 1:49:30| crematoria as an accessory to a cemetery like an accessory to a funeral home is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6570)|
| 1:49:37| and perhaps Mr. Donaldson could speak to this, is something that's happening across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| And what I'm saying is if we need to have it as an accessory use to a cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| and likewise have standards, maybe we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| Make sure it's covered, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Make sure it's covered because it might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Well, that's why I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| I mean, we have a number of cemeteries around, and if they decide to build one, would that be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| How is a cemetery zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| They're kind of all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| There's several of them that are zoned R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| The proposed definitions include a definition of cemetery, which I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| The proposed regulations include a definition for cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| and it says that a cemetery may include a mausoleum, columbarium, memorial garden, or scattering garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| but it does not list cremation facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Those are only listed in the proposed regulations as part of a stand-alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| or as part of a funeral establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| So the cemetery can house the ashes or have them scattered or have them in the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| Yes, but there is a trend to return to the old practice of putting crematories in cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| And I don't want us to get caught by some lawsuit in West Tennessee that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| it's an ordinary complimentary part of a cemetery, and Knoxville, you don't have any regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6661)|
| 1:51:09| Touch the base is your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| Ms. Faulkner, I think, wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| The council would like that to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| We recognize Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Mrs. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| Bearden is one of the densest populated areas in the city, and we have two cemeteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| one which has a crematoria that hasn't been operated in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6694)|
| 1:51:42| Knoxville is one of the most polluted cities in the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| and I hope that you, our elected representatives, are going to take care that the citizens are breathing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6707)|
| 1:51:55| the minimal amount of pollutants or particulates, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| that's possible for you to mandate for us to breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| And I hope in considering this that you'll also be thinking about what we can do to perhaps regulate existing cemeteries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6726)|
| 1:52:17| and use state-of-the-art equipment to regulate any additional crematory, afterburners, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6737)|
| 1:52:26| I'm not familiar with the technology either, but emission burners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| And if we get better products, then we can legislate that these need to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| I hope you'll think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Her comment goes back to my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| It may be that zoning isn't the only vehicle that we have or can use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| and we may have to have a general ordinance that says that any establishment that adds a crematory must do A, B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| C, and D, and that would cover existing ones because that would be a separate lawful ordinance regulating, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6774)|
| 1:53:01| an activity, not a land-use regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| We might have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| I don't know if we do or not, but that's worth thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| We'll move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6790)|
| 1:53:18| We have a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| Adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| We just want to say thank you to every member of council, staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| We appreciate this opportunity more than you'll ever know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120830?start=6808)|
