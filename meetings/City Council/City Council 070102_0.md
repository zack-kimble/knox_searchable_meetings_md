| 0:05:04| On Mayor's Report, two or three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| First of all, we'd like to welcome Madeline Rojero to City Council tonight, but also to City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| and as our Director of Community Development, we're very appreciative of you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| I think everybody in here knows Madeline and her long, great work with the City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| and we're very glad to have you on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Also, she doesn't know I know this, but tomorrow is Ms. Mitchell's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| Twenty-nine once more, she says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Ms. Peters will audit that number for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| I wish we could sing, but she would wish we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| A couple other things, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| The South Waterfront code adoption process, that kind of kicks off officially at MPC on the 11th next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=341)|
| 0:05:50| and then we'll be here, assuming all follows pattern and plan, on the 16th and 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| but it will come up at the MPC meeting on the 11th next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Also, I think Mr. Becker brought this up the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| but Ryner Bay of the Coyne open house on the 8th at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| Get that on the right schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| And then the Martin Luther King celebrations will be again before we meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| which are basically starting that Wednesday the 10th, going through the following Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| Is that right, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=385)|

| 0:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Any reports from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| It's a quiet group tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| 8A is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Mayor, I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the passing of President Gerald Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| I think listening to the commentary today, he really did live a life of example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| whether you're a private citizen or a public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| He was self-described himself as someone that was limited and knew his limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| One time, as a matter of fact, he said that he was a Ford, not a Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| But in listening to the commentary today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| people basically boiled down his reputation as being someone that reflected trust and integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| So I just thought I'd throw that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| That's a good addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| I've been a little puny today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| so I had intended to inquire if a resolution would be appropriate for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| and I guess I was just going to ask my fellow council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| if they would feel that a resolution from the Knoxville City Council for the next meeting would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| I see by common consent it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Maybe our attorney will some note and help us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| And, of course, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=471)|

| 0:08:39| 9B is an ordinance to amend the FY 2006-2007 operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| to increase the amount allocated for public infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| provided for in the recently approved contract between the city and South Grove GP by $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Any questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| We're not going to take any action until we know it's safe legally, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Mr. Kaiser can comment on that, but we feel like we're protected on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| The contract has some protections in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| If for any reason the annexation is deemed to be void in the future, then we can claim the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| That obligation has been guaranteed by the principles of the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| Practically speaking, we're just holding the money for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Right now, nothing has been paid, and it's anticipated it won't be for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| When you say anticipated it won't be for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| are we going to wait until all the maneuvering and wrangling is out of the way before we spend any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| Or are we going to spend some money, and if the annexation is not any good, somebody is going to pay it back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| Which one are we saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| For now, we're holding the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| They have not submitted any invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| I think it's their choice to hold the money until we see what happens from the latest action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| At some point, they may request it, but in the event the annexation is deemed to be void,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| there's a repayment obligation guaranteed by their principles, personally guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Do you have any idea what the time frame is on the expectations for the decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=615)|

| 0:10:17| 11B is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to request the public building authority of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee to perform project management services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=622)|

| 0:10:38| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=640)|

| 0:10:49| for the Streetscapes Near Tennessee Theater project for pedestrian walkway improvements in the 500 block of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| adjacent to the proposed Regal Cinema with the City to pay an amount not to exceed 20% or $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| I talked to Steve King earlier and he was going to have Blaze Birch call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| but Mr. Birch wasn't able to get back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| So what all is this going to entail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| I understand there are no drawings yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| And there haven't been able to be due to some restrictions on the way the federal money gets paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| But let me take a shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| I tried to call Blaze as well this afternoon and couldn't get him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| It will be a walkway, escalator, and elevator covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| The escalators covered the whole way until you get to Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Then once you hit Gay Street, it obviously is open to the elements like the rest of the sidewalk there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| It's all designed so that the traffic would be funneled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| This is important not just for the cinema, but basically to get people from State Street and parking areas up to Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| So it's all designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| You cannot get to the cinema without going to Gay Street, which was by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| It also is all obviously ADA compliant because it's federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Well, because we would do it that way anyway, but obviously with federal money it's very explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| So is it going to be similar to like the bridge between this part of the building and the next part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| except that it will be open on one end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| I think it actually will not be conditioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Am I right there, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| That's correct, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| So it won't be air conditioned or heated space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| It will just be covered space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| And that was, quite frankly, a cost-saving move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| Ms. Fiala?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Well, that just brings a question to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Is it similar to at the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| That's probably…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| I was trying to envision that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| And that seems to be the only…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| That's probably a good…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| Is there an elevator there at the Coliseum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| No, there is, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Oh, there are escalators at the Coliseum, but they haven't functioned in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Well, this is going to be a functioning one, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| But is it going to come out next to where Bill Sampson's H.D. Hackney is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=777)|
| 0:13:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Yes, it runs along that, the south edge of his building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| the north edge of where the theater development is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| Those are good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| I might, if I might, make one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Several people commented through the article in the paper this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| about how the costs go from the original number to this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| It's really an apples and oranges comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Number one, this pedestrian connection, which we received 75 percent federal money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| is a lot of the additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Number two, saving the S&W was $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Number three, just general escalation in building costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Number four, quite frankly, it's not the same building either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| This building has about an extra 10 percent in square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| versus what that building was contemplated at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| It's quite frankly, it's just a bigger complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| So it's not a, people said, how did the construction costs go up that much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| It didn't go up that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| It was, like I said, it's a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=850)|

| 0:14:23| on 14 Knoxville area transit trolley coaches at a cost not to exceed $74,200 and no dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| and for the city to have the right to exercise one or both of two options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| to install camera systems on additional Knoxville area transit vehicles over the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=881)|

| 0:16:12| But, first, I wanted to invite you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| In addition, there's going to be a public meeting on the 10th at 530 at the drop-in center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=974)|
| 0:16:23| And then the oversight committee meets that same day at noon at room 549.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| So, you all are encouraged and welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| And, as you'll see, what I've done is handed you all out a handout that illustrates some of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| The first picture is really one of the biggest concerns is that what may be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| We had, you know, the community came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| You all had a series of workshops last winter, and the community said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| We want to save the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| We want to preserve the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| And we've talked about upgrading the neighborhoods and things we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| But what I'm very concerned about is if you get in a situation where you make the land more valuable than the houses that are sitting on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1018)|
| 0:17:06| then it leads to neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| And I know that there's going to be stepped-up codes enforcement, and, you know, there's going to be improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| but already we're seeing properties being bought up by outside developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| And I'm not saying that they're all going to neglect their properties, but that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| Also, I wanted to address something you might have read in the paper about Rivertown being practically sold out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| I hope you all will look at the tax rolls and see that that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| There's still a significant number still owned by the developer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| You know, it's not that they've done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| They've had some sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I think, you know, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| There is market demand, but I don't want you all to get the idea that there is so overwhelming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| that if you zone everything to condos that it's just going to get snatched up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| because that's not happening now, and it certainly isn't going to happen with interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| So let's take this slow, and let's not try to put people out of their houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| especially that's not what the community asks for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| So what you'll see, I've illustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| We have come down a bit on the housing sizes on the SW1 on the roof heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| It's not quite so overpowering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| I'm still concerned about on the double lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| I've shown on this sheet here you could have, according to the floor area ratios and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| you could have an 11,000 square foot structure on a double lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| One thing that we have not addressed is I have not heard yet anything about density or number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1117)|
| 0:18:46| So what I've shown, just based on the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| now one thing they have done is they're trying to keep parking underground and in the basement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| but I've shown an illustration and on the street of a unit that's got enough parking spaces for 11 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1133)|
| 0:19:04| So you've got somebody, you might have a single family home living next door to you on a double lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| and then this zoning would be allowing people to come in with a very large multifamily dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1151)|
| 0:19:21| I think that's a concern because when people are, when you have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| that I think could destroy the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| We've got a very close-knit neighborhood where people have lived there since forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| I've been going around getting petition signs from people that aren't able to come to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| It's been a very slow process because you get in there and you start talking to these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| and they've been there for 50 years and you just, I've been there 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| and you just start reminiscing, you know, it goes on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| So I just want to let you know that it's not just me and Patty that are concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| After this, I've got a drawing of SW2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| This is something that I had thought was going to be some sort of a transitional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| and it just seems to be going like topsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I got my calculator out, and I did it two or three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| and from what I see, and I've got the chart at the end of the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| you could have, if you had a triple lot, and you could have bigger than a triple lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| There's no maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Thirty more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| The lot size is pretty big on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| You could have a 67,500 square foot building right across the street from these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| I've illustrated that on the next row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Contrary to what you heard, these are not all rental houses with owners that are eager to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| You know, a lot of these are homeowners and people that, you know, want to maintain their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| So I'd like to see us have some sort of a compromise so that we're not encouraging people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| and setting the stage to do something that won't preserve the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| and I appreciate all your concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| Patty, if you'd give us your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| My name is Patty Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| I live at 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| I also had a couple handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| One of them are photos that I took yesterday on Langford and Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| I mentioned this at the workshop that the city council had the other week before Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| I'm really concerned Phillips and Langford Avenue go from 13 feet to, at the widest part, 29 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| which is right by the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| As it is right now on the plans, we're looking at a 50-foot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| I'm not quite sure how we're going to expand, where we're going to get the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| There's also a problem on some of these pictures that you have where you see the backyards of a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| and it's five foot above the road, and then you have a 13-foot span of roadway, and then it drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| It could be anywhere from five foot to 20-something feet, dropping off towards the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| I'm not sure how we're going to get around a 50-foot road span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| I don't think it can be done without taking people's front yards, which are nonconforming already, their backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1346)|
| 0:22:34| I can't see anyone taking the developer's land to expand the roads out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| There is going to be a wide road that runs along the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| so I'm concerned that Langford and Phillips both end up being widened, and then we end up with no land at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1364)|
| 0:22:53| With the way our houses are and the nonconformance, this even makes our lot smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| I believe that this needs to be addressed before the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| Once it's approved, it's harder to get it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| I would also like to bring up—oh, I'd like to say hi to my sisters and my nephew who are in from Florida and Idaho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1391)|
| 0:23:20| Anyways, Phillips Avenue is—the road is actually above the yards, and we need curbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1400)|
| 0:23:29| We need the road deepened, underground utilities, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| To keep the neighborhood as it is and bring it up also at the same time, we really can't deal with the 50-foot road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1414)|
| 0:23:45| What we have now just needs to be improved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| I would also like to bring up, with form-based codes, Bob Becker had brought up infill housing, the ordinance that they're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1429)|
| 0:23:59| and I would like to find out if there's some way that could be worked on to be incorporated into this form base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| We have lots on Phillips Avenue that we could have houses built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| They're nonconforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| If we had the infill housing ordinance incorporated into this, we would be able to have houses built on these nonconforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1452)|
| 0:24:23| I also have concerns with some of the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| We have a lot of scrap trees, but there are some good trees along Langford and some of the side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| and if the roads are widened, what would happen with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1474)|
| 0:24:45| I believe that's about all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| I'm very, very concerned about the preservation of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| That's an important factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| There's only four blocks to Phillips, and that really needs to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| I know we have one developer that has some houses that would probably be torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| They've been empty for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| We'd like to actually see those fixed up and sold or rented, but actually stay in the form of a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1512)|
| 0:25:23| Anyways, my big concern is the road widths and where they're going to expand to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| and possibly seeing that addressed maybe even before the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Seeing no further business to come before council, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I think that's a new record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070102?start=1543)|
