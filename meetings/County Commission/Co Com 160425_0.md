| 0:09:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Ma'am, this is a pretty good sized piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| almost two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| This map we have shows two buildings on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Which one is going to be your bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| D107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| It's three suites converted into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| There are two buildings on the property at the same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Which one is your bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| The big one or the little one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| The little one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=617)|
| 0:10:17| The little one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| What is the big one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Will be the main restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| It's a full service restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Yours also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| OK, the restaurant then is the Backwood Bistro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| That's what it used to be, Backwoods Bristow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| So they're both going to be speeding in Dallas now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| For some reason, the owner that owns this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| converted these three suites into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| So it's a 33,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| So we're just going to use a small section to make the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| In the big building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| It's a strip center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| I was going to ask, you could probably ask staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| It's a strip center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| It's a big building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| It's got several different suites in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| And the other building is the old gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| I can't remember exactly what it is, but it's a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| That's what I thought, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| I need to ask who's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| The second was Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=691)|
| 0:11:31| Yeah, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I must have misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| I thought you said the address was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| other than what's on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| What is the address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| The address for the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| No, your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| My address is 3125 Bluewine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| I just misunderstood you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| And I noticed the owner's name is not listed on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| but it's some corporation or something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| owns the strip mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| It's Black Oak LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Is it on your own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=721)|
| 0:12:01| It's not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| It's on the dash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| It's on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| It's on the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| I was looking at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=730)|
| 0:12:10| Just wanted a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=730)|

| 0:12:12| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=732)|

| 0:12:21| I see no lights at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| The motion is properly before us to approve with the pendings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=749)|

| 0:12:54| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| One other piece of, it's not business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| but one other thing that needs to come before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| Captain Mays, you're on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=781)|

| 0:13:37| Can we move back to 330?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| Is it possible that we can, that far in advance, change the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| we have to set it, though, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I don't know if 30 minutes would be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| We may want to move it to 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| I think we back up to 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=833)|

| 0:14:11| because of the number of violations that were caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Is this what would be normally referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| to as the pre-prom date stings or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| Yes, I'll have several for the Farragut beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| What we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| How many did you look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Did we get to keep the Farragut money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Don't even get to hear, we don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| get to hear the Farragut troubles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| How many establishments did you go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| I don't have the count, but it was over 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| So it's still somewhere around 28%, 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| The motion that is before us is to have the June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Is there something embedded in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Are we going to have beer board in May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Or do we cancel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| So there's something before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Oh, we will have beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Beer board occurs every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| OK, I didn't know if we had anything before us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=917)|
| 0:15:17| There's always beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Stay warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| You can't make people wait that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| Oh, we will have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| You can tell him what I told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| If we do not let him go on vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| then he will be spending a month with each commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| because his spouse will have put him out of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| And the lucky commissioner that ends up in the draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| would have him for two months in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Who's the lucky one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| If we do not let him take vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| What kind of yard work can he do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Who's the big winner for June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| That wouldn't be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Oh, you don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| If he stays with you, he won't stay anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| OK, the motion that is before us is on the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| We will be convened at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| The June beer board meeting will be at 3 PM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| And that's actually going to be like two weeks before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| have wine and grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| So it'll get even more exciting, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| Only in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| Remember, they've got 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| We have several that have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| for wine sales in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Oh, I'm talking about wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| You can't sell wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1015)|
| 0:16:55| It'd have to be state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| I mean, you can't buy hard wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| That's liquor, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| It's not considered wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| OK, you can continue to talk amongst yourselves after a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| The one last thing, Commissioner Broyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| are we in receipt of a nephew yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Not yet, but he's on his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| There'll be no further business to come before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you, my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Madam Clerk, you'll call the roll for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| the April meeting of the Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1061)|

| 0:17:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1062)|

| 0:17:51| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1071)|
| 0:17:51| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1072)|
| 0:17:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| 11 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| 11 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| I was looking across the crowd for Mayor Burchard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Is Mayor Burchard here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| He's on his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| He's on his way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| As we have listed for public forum this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Mike Hammond is here to speak of the Clerk of Courts Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Mr. Chairman and members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1105)|
| 0:18:25| I'm here because quarterly we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| to report to you on any excess fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| that we have from our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| And I'd like to ask Chris Caldwell if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| would come down and join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| I will tell you that in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| we've kind of changed the terminology a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| We're not calling it excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| We are, however, referring to it as an efficiency dividend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| And the reason we're doing that is because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| is the efficiency of the office that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| determines the amount of money that we're able to turn over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| And a dividend is represented from companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| that give to their shareholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| And as I tell our people, our shareholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| are the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| And so, Mr. Caldwell, it is with a great honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| that our employees present to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| our first quarter efficiency dividend of $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| And I would also like to say that since this money has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| come from the justice system, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| like to suggest to you that perhaps $5,000 of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| be added to the reward that they have accumulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| to try to find the murderers of the 12-year-old young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| from Bearden Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Of course, I don't mean to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| how to spend the money, but since it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| did come from the justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| I wanted to throw that out as a possibility for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| But again, thank you so much for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| There are no honorary resolutions this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| The proposal will be led by Commissioner John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| At this time, I'd like to have another Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| This is Seth Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| He's the assistant pastor at Christ Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Church in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| And about 60 days ago, he actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| volunteered to be a chaplain with the Tennessee Air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| National Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| So congratulations on that honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| And thank you for the invitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| And thank you all for what you do for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| as citizens in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| I know firsthand from my dad being on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| that it takes a lot of work, a lot of sacrifice, service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| time away from your family, and also time away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| from your other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| And so thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| I'm just going to briefly read a passage from the word of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| and then I'll say a prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| This is from Romans chapter 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And this is what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| for there is no authority except that which God had established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| The authorities that exist have been established by God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Consequently, he who rebels against the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| is rebelling against what God has instituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| And those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| For rulers hold no tear for those who do right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| but for those who do wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| What Paul is saying in this passage is a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| First off, he says who is ultimately in control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| and who is in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| And he's saying God is the one who is ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| in control and in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| And so when we give our pledge in just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| we say one nation under God, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| believe we recognize who is in complete control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| and that is God himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| But then the passage goes on to say something more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| and that is what God has instituted and established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| And he's established government for our welfare and our good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| And in fact, he's appointed you as our leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| You may not have known that, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| what it says in the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| It calls you God's servants, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| because you serve the people and you serve him ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| So that's who is in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| But we also go on this passage and we find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| what's the purpose of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I'm one that always asks the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| why do we do what we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| And I'm sure you often ask that question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| And so the big question is, why do you do what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| And the Bible tells us there's two reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| why you do what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| The first thing you do, or why you govern, is to promote good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| And the second is to restrain evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| That's why you're here in this place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| and here representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| So the passage goes on to say, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| you want to be free from fear of the one in authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Then do what is right, and he will commend you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| for he is God's servant to do you good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| What Paul is saying here is, your purpose is to promote good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| And so that means you give approval and praise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| to those who do what is good, to the people, to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| to the businesses who do good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| You continue to praise them and promote good and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| you're doing great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| So any laws that you pass should be for good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| to promote good, for the common welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| as it says in our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| But then it goes on to say, you're also to restrain evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| And I love the language here in Romans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| It goes on to say, not only are you God's servant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| but it says, if you do wrong, be afraid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| for he who does not bear the sword for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| He is God's servant and agent of wrath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| That's pretty intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| But what Romans is saying here, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| the Bible is saying here is, your other purpose of governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| is to restrain evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| In other words, if someone breaks the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| you enforce the rules and say, what you're doing is wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| and there are consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| And so as you meet, keep the big picture in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| of why you're here and what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| The purpose of government is to promote good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| and to restrain evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| And finally, the passage tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| as citizens how we are to respond in this whole matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| It goes on to say, it is necessary to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| but also because of conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| And verse 7 says, give everyone what you owe him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| If you owe taxes, pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| If revenue, then revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| If respect, then respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| If honor, then honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| What this is saying is simply this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Us as citizens, we are to respect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| We are to honor you because God has put you in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| And so we honor you by praying for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| We honor you by supporting you and by encouraging you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| that you're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| So again, thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| And let me close in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| and how the Bible does give us guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| It gives us complete understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| of what government is and what government does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| And you tell us in your word over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| that government is supposed to promote good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| the general welfare of the citizens of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| that they serve, and also to restrain evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| And Lord, I pray that as our commissioners meet tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| that you will give them wisdom, that you will give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| discernment, that you will help them to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| the main thing the main thing, and to keep this main thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| in mind that what they do and whatever they discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| should be either to promote good or to restrain evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| And I pray, Lord, that you will give them insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| and help them all to agree as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| discuss these important matters that affect all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| And I pray for us as citizens that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| will honor and respect our authorities, our leaders who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| you've put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you, Lord, for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| And we pray that as we continue meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| that it will be for your glory and for the good of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| In Jesus' name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| The Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| If you would stand and give a proper salute to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1553)|
| 0:26:03| My fellow commissioners, I'll take a moment of privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| It has been only a week since we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| a great time at the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| We had an air show in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| And I would like for the Honorable Mayor of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Mayor Tim Burchett, to come down to the podium for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| First, I need to say that I attended the air show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| It had been maybe 20 years since I had seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| something of that caliber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| And maybe not of the caliber that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| was witnessed here at the Knoxville Airport a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Mayor Burchett, I commend you for getting the show in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| and offer you a part of public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| for a moment to recognize what it took to get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| I guess I could be the perfect thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| is take full credit for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| I had absolutely nothing to do with it other than the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| That was what I was in charge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I was driving in today from something out in Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| And I was looking at the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| And I thought, man, it hadn't been that clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| since the air show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| If you miss the air show, you miss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I mean, we hadn't had one in 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And really, I would like to take the full credit for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| But the actual person on my staff who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| was really responsible for it was Colonel Richard Julian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Through his contacts and some other folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| they were able to get the Blue Angels here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| which is the premier fighter group in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| And they didn't disappoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| If you weren't there, you missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| If you were there, and say you were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| and your face is not red, I know you're not telling the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Because everybody got sunburned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=1676)|

| 0:45:34| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| On page 16, Resolution 801, authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2742)|

| 0:45:51| located at State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| There is a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Seeing no, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Not that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| So we had a long talk about 901 last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| which is different than 801 as it is a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| But I think the issues persist in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| and I'll say at the outset, not necessarily these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| I know we're only talking about 801, but these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| But really, where we're going from here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| I guess a couple of things that kind of stuck with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| I think, and I'm going to grossly paraphrase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| that I think I heard last week that these things will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| be with us always if we're doing downtown development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| You can't make the deal unless they have a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| And I guess I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| I think, like I say, at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| at some point, downtown is vibrant enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| The sales per square foot is enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| to be able to do it on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| And that may be kind of a novel concept there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| but just do it on your own at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| I'm not saying 2016 is that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| But I guess what I'm trying to get a feel for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| is how we get here, how we get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| how do we get to these two, what made these numbers work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| And then the other piece is, and we talked about it a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| this whole notion of public improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| seems to be getting a little grayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| leaning toward the direction away from general benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| to the citizens of Knotts County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| So that's some of the, I'm putting it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I'm not sugarcoating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Those are my issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| And these are in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| And it doesn't mean I've got to just run forward cheering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| I need to question them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| As I say, I'm going to support both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| But we, this body, should take a little step backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| as these things are coming up and say, OK, what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| When is it time to remeasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| You know, 10 years ago, go forward, keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| We're a long way down this line, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| had some pretty successful ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| So I don't know, Mr. Lyons, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| want to talk to how we get to these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and how we get, or someone else, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| I won't add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| I think Buzz is going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Well, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| If you don't mind, talk to the Bud 4 principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| We spent a lot of time talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Bill Lyons, 607 Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Appreciate being asked to address the Bud 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I was planning on doing that in context of the TIFA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| The question fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| And I will briefly describe where we are on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| We go through a two-pronged process, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| Could this project happen without the assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| That's the Bud 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| And secondly, which gets to the second part Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| McKenzie raised, even if it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| what is the public interest in proceeding with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| That is, so many projects don't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| but for government interference or government aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| We've had those come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| And I've said to many of them, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| the project probably just shouldn't happen then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| if it doesn't work financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| What overrides that concept on these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| especially the downtown and the city core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| not just the core of downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| And what our approach has always been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| that the public interest to that is somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| of a complex notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| That is, it isn't that the public, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| would have access to parking in either one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| It's that the project itself does a lot for city taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| and county taxpayers, provides a lot of benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| The benefits to some of them are quite easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| For the older buildings, restores older buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| removes blight, gets economic activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| And I think we've taken those through the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| and had a reasonable amount of consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| When we're talking about building new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| I think it raises a whole other set of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| because the issues are a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| And in this case, the public benefits from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| by having, both in this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| and the one down toward Regus Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| on having the development takes place in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| where we bring a lot of people in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| where the infrastructure is already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| where we see a very good amount of taxes for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| to support services both through city property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| and county property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| and that this development can bring...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| can happen without any objection from any neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| without putting any burden on schools that are overcrowded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| but any students that would come would go to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| where there was capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| where there isn't any need for road or sidewalk improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| If there were, then city government will handle those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| We don't ever expect county government to handle those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| So in both of these, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I was going to speak more specifically about the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| but the principle applies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| we think it's in the public interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| to get all of our underproducing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| under areas that are either producing no taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| or very little taxes on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| so they can provide money for services all over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| for the schools, for city services and county services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| because they pay city property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| and county property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| So we think the benefit, to put another look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| we know how many times in both of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| can you invest multiple millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| and house multiple numbers of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| and be able to say that there are no neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| that say you're going to increase stormwater runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| you're going to increase traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| you're going to cause all these other disruptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| This is a very efficient way to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| which we think is in the public interest to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| But we, so that sort of gets overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| from the city's point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| what we've said is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| if you're going to come for new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| we very much want to hear that you're going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| the parking, the structured parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| which is something that most developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| all over Knoxville and Knox County don't have as an expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| and it is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| So that's part of, now what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| not so much that that parking provides a public benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| to the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| but rather that parking requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| makes the but-for come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| It's very, very expensive to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| and these projects would be upside down without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Let me briefly allude to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| that we have talked to many developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| and their bankers and it's clear that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| if this isn't structured parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| for this type of development in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| there is no way we'll ever provide a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| and the developer will never be able to get this project done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| unless this person can provide parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| or on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| put the demand on the city through our garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| which we said we're at capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| and we really can't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| Now, let me address the but-for generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| and I think because you raised a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Well, how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| How do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| We originally had a very disciplined process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| by which we would meet with folks at the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| that is if they came through the city first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| meet with Chris Caldwell or his predecessors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| and say, here's a report from a banker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| a third party banker to answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| would you ever loan money for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| without the TIF or the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| And most of the time they came back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| not only would I not loan it without it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I wouldn't even loan it with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| These are very, very risky projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| and that's why, especially during the tough period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Now, I'll have to admit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| we've gotten a little away from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| because we've had an awful lot of trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| getting bankers to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| because they have to recuse themselves from other projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| and I think at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| we need to bring you to tell your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| a little more assurance that in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| this project won't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| but for the requested participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| and that's one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| I was prepared to talk about later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| but I could talk about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| talk to Chris Caldwell, Mark Mametoff is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| We are going to institute a program now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| I think it's called for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| and I hear questions that brought this to our attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| by which we get a third party from elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| who could be familiar with the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| that could come in independently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| review all of these and provide a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| I will add one other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| we do turn some of these down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| I mean, the irony of this is you only see the ones we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| There are some that have come to our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| where we say we just don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| this passes the but-for test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| we think it'll go anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| I might add that the last one we did that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| still hadn't happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| so we may have been wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Now, what's the risk on being wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| The property sits there producing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Just one final example for the next one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| and I'll be quiet and answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| or we can wait till later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Right now, the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| the Marble Alley number two is producing no property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| my understanding, it's county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| The other project, the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| is producing $1,800 a year in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| I would hate, what we don't want to risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| is saying we'll just leave it like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| not contributing, not producing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| because we'll take the guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| that it will be done anyway and be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| There's probably some small chance we could be wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| and we may have been on the but-for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| that it might have happened anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| but we do not want to bring anything to our council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| or to you that we're not very sure that but-for holds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| because otherwise, let's face it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| it's just a benefit to a developer that's not needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| and that's the last thing that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| So what we do is we do hear your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| and you wonder about how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Part of the problem is a lot of the remaining projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| that people are either bringing more ambitious projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| or some of the remaining buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| let's take Prior Brown, that are left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| are very, very troubled and challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| as they are and they're remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| just because nobody could ever make them work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| So that's sort of our general approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| to both the but-for and the public interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| and the public interest is a little more diffuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| but we'd like to be able for you to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| to your constituents, not in the city necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| that'd be fine, but whether it's Powell or Corryton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| or any place, why should you vote for something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| And it would be, this is producing money right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| in county taxes, the county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| won't have to write a single check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| not any debit going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| It's just delaying the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| the full tax realization a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| and it's allowing development to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| that puts no pressure on your schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| or on advance on your roads or traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| and we think it's a very efficient way to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| and as I say, we think it's somewhat of advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| with our council and hopefully with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| to say, God, there's gonna be hundreds of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| and millions of dollars spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| and there isn't a single neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| objecting to this development, which we think is positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| So that's basically the overall approach we bring to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| and if you want to, I'll speak more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| to the tax increment financing one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| when it comes out in the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| and yield to others to speak about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| but this is a very legitimate discussion to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| and I appreciate that and we do think it's time for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| to come with a more rigorous process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| by which to address the but-for in a credible way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| for the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| So yeah, I do appreciate you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| getting with county and the other departments to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| I mean, even the length of the pilot or the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| they just, to me, seems, and I may be in error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| just kind of long at first and fairly random in terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| you know, it's like, again, we're not talking about 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| They all seem to be 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| When I first came on commission, they weren't all 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Now, this is kind of a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| So if nothing else, I just wanna slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| and it sounds like you all are considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| are going to, you know, enact that third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| So this third party person won't be a local entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| There'll be a, when you say independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| there will be somebody who's familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| We think we need to bring somebody in who's not local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| There's too many people interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| in too many of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| and they need to be totally independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| And second, but they need to be very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| with building costs, land costs, construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| everything so they can tell us this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| just will not work except at this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| No bank will finance it credibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| And that's what we need to report to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| that we have that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| And I apologize that we haven't had that kind of rigor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| up till now at this last grouping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| We went through a phase where we went from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| into making our own calls based on our own analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| and I don't think that's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you, Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| But before we get to Commissioner Anders' questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| Mr. Caldwell, I just want you to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| There are blanks in the supporting documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| that we will need dollar figures and months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| Is that connected somewhere in our paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| And you talk about that amongst yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| back there for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Well, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3597)|
| 0:59:57| I was gonna call Todd up here and get the fill-ins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| It's on the bottom of page two and the middle of page three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| there's blanks to be filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3604)|
| 1:00:14| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Top of page three should be the term of 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| When does it start, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| I'll let Todd speak too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| Mr. Napier, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| I'm here on behalf of the Industrial Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Board of Knox County, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| You know, this came before you last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| and we came up here and asked for it to be deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| because I simply wasn't comfortable with all the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| didn't have all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| And BUS has worked very hard to get us that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Because ultimately, after it goes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| before this can be finally ratified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| it's gonna have to go before the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| So we worked through a lot of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| and making sure that I understood the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| And he has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| I've met with the county IDB attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| So I just wanted to kind of give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| that, that we've gone through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| to make sure that the numbers work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| and we understand the logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| And as Dr. Lyons spoke, this is primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| to support the gap that's created by the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| that he's going to do structural parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| And that's been better defined as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| It's going to be underneath the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| as we've been presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| We've given those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| So when you asked about when it would start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| it would start essentially 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| It's meant to give him 10 years of benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| So the way we're able to set the lease up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| it would be such that upon completion of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| and starts creating, it would be 10 years at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| And that's the way Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| who's the IDB's attorney, sets these up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| So it's 10 years of benefit, but it wouldn't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| it would start and give him 10 years of benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| So we would expect, I know that Buzz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| is going to go out and do some additional things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| We had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| He's not going to come straight to the IDB immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| correct, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| So he's going to go get his deal completely lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| He'll bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| And then typically what he'll do is set up a no later than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| And typically what Chris will put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| about a year for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| I guess the two questions I have based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| on what you just made us say, we've got empty blanks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| So those numbers are not going to be in the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| So I have some right here that I have penciled in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| if you'd like to put those in based on our conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| just as recently as about a week and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| OK, if you'll give us those, it's taxes annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| and the amount of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| And so what we did was he had a total, let me grab this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3776)|
| 1:03:07| so the project could support a total tax burden of $51,450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| And I then took that and just basically split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| that based on a pro rata percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| of the difference between what county taxes are and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| And so the amount of the annual city pilot payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| would be $27,793.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| And the counties would be $23,657.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3814)|
| 1:03:42| And what's the term not to exceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3825)|
| 1:03:45| Now is there a not to exceed on the construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| I mean, we're not going to just let it sit for two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| years and if the project doesn't move, I mean, what's our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| Well, the way it'll happen with the County Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Development Board, one of the things we've been more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| diligent about in recent years, because we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| gotten some projects like when you're ever going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| started, so that it will be approved with a set date by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| which it has to close and move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| or otherwise it would have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| And that'll be put forth in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| in the lease documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| What will the taxes be after 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| Hey, Buzz, you want to come up here and speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| This is your document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| I know what the, we anticipate the benefit over 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| to be about $3.27 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| But what we paid, when we flip around and start paying real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| property tax, what will that, based on today's assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| So based on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| About $370,000, or $320,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Yeah, so $320,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| Mr. Napier, let me back you up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| Let me read the numbers back that we've written down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| For the city, $27,753.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| $793.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3912)|
| 1:05:12| $793.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| $793.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| And for the county, $23,657.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3920)|
| 1:05:30| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| Mr. Lyon, you can answer this by shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| You've talked about your new procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| in bringing in an outside expert to kind of look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| these things over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| I think it is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| But from what I understand, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| think this is important for everybody else to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| too, is that this is not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| a cost for a city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| This cost is going to be directed to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| This would be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Mr. Lyons, I have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Jack of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| On these pilots, if the rest of the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| we have a property tax increase, does that pilot payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| in any way change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| Well, let's say they vary a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Basically, they're excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| In a pilot, they're going to be frozen at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| regardless of whether there is an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Now, of course, once they come off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| they'll be at that higher rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| So the TIF portion does pay the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| A TIF, on the other hand, immediately pays that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| So that will increase when that goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| Is there any way we can look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| to where it is fair to the rest of us citizens paying taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| that if we get an increase, they share in it, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| Well, I'd say through a pilot, you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| I guess there might be some way you could have written in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| it's payment in lieu of, that that payment in lieu of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| could be altered at some point based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| That probably could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Now, what will happen on a TIF, on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| is the more they pay toward that TIF, the sooner it expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| And then you get it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| So in a sense, it'll come out in the wash on a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| So a pilot does have some possibilities we could work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| to see whether that payment could reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Okay, and the experts you're looking at hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| will they be someone, and you mentioned this slightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| that is an expert in cost analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| so that we can make sure that the but-for profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| in any case, is not but-for lack of management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| Yes, I think they will make the assumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| and that's a very good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| they're gonna look at this in its entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| that will bring in not only making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| that the costs that the developer presents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| are really what they think are reasonable costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| because it's very hard for us to know that from the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| without that expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| And secondly, I guess they will also assess to the degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| that they think the project would be the risk involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| in a number of other factors that say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| is there any way without this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| that you could ever hope to get funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| So they'll take a very holistic look at everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| but it'll be fundamentally that those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| in terms of investment and the rate of return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| are reasonable and something we can have confidence in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| and we want that to be a totally unbiased look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| and we want them to basically answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| could this project go without it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| Is that something you could tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| in pretty clear yes or no terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| And to second degree, give us guidance on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| because Commissioner McKenzie referenced the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| how much do we need to close the gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| We'll rely on them for both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| to give us an independent evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Commissioner Oyenbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| Todd, Commissioner Anders asked about the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Did you give that total after the 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| what they would be paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Or I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| It's estimated, and Buzz found the number for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| it's estimated about $320,000 combined city-county taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| once it comes out of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| we have a proper motion and second before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Does these not have to be done by roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| This is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Oh, these want me to go first so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| You have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Page 17, Resolution 903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| approving an amendment to the Jackson Depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Redevelopment Urban Renewal Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| to provide for tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| for the Regas Property LLC project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| located at 305 and 319 West Depot Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| We have before us a motion to approve properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4220)|
| 1:10:20| You know, I'm not interested in rehashing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| the whole thing for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| you know, you just have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| good fortune of being the one in the barrel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| at this particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| but I'm not interested in rehashing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| the whole thing for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| you just have to be in the barrel at this particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| but I guess in terms of just a general comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| to you and Buzz and to everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| you know, as I said last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| I don't have a lot more time here on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| but hopefully, hopefully we will acknowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| acknowledge that things are better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| and maybe a TIF is still needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| but we don't need what I consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| the maximum amount for every TIF every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| that we start to wean ourselves off of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| as these projects become more and more successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| And I'm hoping, and I have every confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| that this body will, and this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| that Mr. Lyons described will yield better results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| And when I say better results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| the monies that you're getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| I know the but for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| but the monies that you're getting for this TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| is taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I mean, okay, well, sit there idle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Maybe, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Okay, it may or may not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| but again, I'll say in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| I'm not talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| I'm not talking about the next one out to shoot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| but in time, I think we need to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| wean ourselves out off of this milk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| and get to some real substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| And that, to me, will say Knoxville's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| Downtown Knoxville's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| It's flourishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Things are going well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| so unless there's some environmental issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| or unless it's like the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Prior Brown Garage that has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| serious infrastructure issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| But, you know, this is a green field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| This is a green field, asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| That's what we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| So, again, you know, I just encourage you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| out there to, you know, sharpen your pencils a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| and say, okay, I may take a little bit more risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| on this one and make it better for the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4369)|
| 1:12:49| I'll be very brief on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| Commissioner McKenzie, I think that the process outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| by bringing this third party in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| is going to change this dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| And I think that part of your concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| a good portion of your concerns will be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| by this third party, because right now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| it's two people that want it, I mean, on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| and they're trying to come to agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| But if the third party says, hey, it's not such a good deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| then I think that the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| are gonna say, oh, you know, you're paying this guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| to tell you that you shouldn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| so we're not gonna go buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| I would suggest the reason why I'm voting no on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| is because I wanna wait till the third party gets here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| and tells us whether it's a good deal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| We're just imagining that it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| And they've already admitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| we gotta get somebody to tell us it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| So it's taxpayer monies, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| and I suggest we wait until we get the third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| and find out the figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| Some of the people addressing us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| have to go through files and files to give us numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| that's not filled out in our reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| I think we're way too soon on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| I have a question of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Would the developer please come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| My name's Joe Petrie with Conversion Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| 520 West Summit Hill, Suite 903, 379202, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| And Mr. Petrie, you also wish to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Do you wish to still speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| I was gonna defer for questions, but I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| I would like to point out to Mr. Brantley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I appreciate your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| and I do have all my numbers in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| I'm happy to talk about any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| I guess the thing I wanna say is thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| for the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| I've been doing this a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| I plan on doing this a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| since I opened my firm in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| and actually since I started development work in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| I worked on over $20 million worth of improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Southeastern Glass was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| Taylor Lofts was second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| And then I worked on the Walnut Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| We had a TIF on Southeastern Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| We had a pilot on Taylor Lofts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| and then nothing from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| on the Walnut Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| We were able to do that without some assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| other than the city had bought the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| and put that into the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| I worked as a fee developer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| But we're very proud of what we're producing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| And on this deal, we do see an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| in $43,000 per year in our taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| And that's why I like to do a TIF anytime I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| If you're selling something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| you can typically use a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| because the taxpayers that are paying those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| are the ones that receive the direct benefit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| So it's not affecting the global county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| It's affecting the taxpayers that are putting money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| into the project by buying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| And so that's a $43,000 increase in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| We did look at trying to do a shorter TIF, Mr. McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| and I appreciate that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| That's the right question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| The TIF is a product of doing the loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| based on the amount of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| that are available to support the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| So the amount of taxes that were available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| to support the loan supported the TIF ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| but only to a 20-year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| So ultimately, we did the analysis on a 15-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| and it left us almost $80,000 a year short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| Hopefully, the term does shorten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| by the increase in the property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| and that's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| We'd like nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| We guarantee this loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| We take it out in our name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| and obviously, we'd like to finish that loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| So with that, I'll defer to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| I just need some information here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Now, this is a condo project, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Okay, so when the condos are sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| the individual that's buying the condo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| is just like a single-family house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| He will take the burden of the property tax on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| So when you get all the condos sold in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| what will be the property tax value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| If we were to sell the project out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| then the total taxes from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| it produces $223,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| Per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4651)|
| 1:17:31| Yes, sir, and of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| the county takes out about 20% of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| to pay its money that goes to the county debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| and then we use the rest of that to support the TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| and, sir, that's what I was going to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| The portion that we get only pays debt services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| It doesn't provide us with any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| to provide any services to any of the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| and along that line, we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| Yes, that's true, but I can't change the legislation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| That's the state legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| so we're using the tool that we're given in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| And, Chris, I have a question for you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4688)|
| 1:18:22| Over the last several years, and I'm not sure how many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| but our school system has been having to pay debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| out of some of their general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Can we change this portion to where we can include that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| into this part of a future TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| Yes, and actually, we've already started that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| We used to, through TIFs, get about 13%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| because of how we structured our school construction fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| and we changed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| and since then, we're at like a 23% now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| We've had internal discussions about moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| where we budget a transfer from general purpose school fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| to debt service to pay for the part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| the piece of school's debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| that they can't cover through property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| moving that over there slowly in an attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| to not have a transfer from general purpose school fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| to debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| and which would basically line up your revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| with your expenditures, and in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| if we did that, we'd be moving property tax pennies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| from general purpose school fund to debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| which would increase that percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| Mr. Petrie, if you'll come back up, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| You answered Mr. Bussler's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| I think that the 220, if you sold out in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| let's say you built for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| and then you sold out in year three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| you're saying the taxes collected would be 223?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Or it would be the 43,000 until the end of the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| The total taxes, 43,000 until the end of the TIF, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| Okay, so that was one of my clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Right, I thought he was asking about the total amount of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| that support the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Hey, Mr., just one kind of final comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| and Joe hit on it, and he's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| This is, you know, this was empowered to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| you know, this power was given us by the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| and it does specify, hey, it only goes for debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| which, in my mind, gets to Ed's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| and we need to be taking these things very, very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| because there is no true, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| my words, not the legislature, not the act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| there's no, in these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| there's no benefit to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| Getting parking spots off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| making a better facade from a parking lot to a condo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| you know, that, to me, is a stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| So, and again, I'm picking on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| With all that said, I'm going to support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| because I do think this will help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| but I'm just asking this body, city, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| if we could, you know, moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| kind of wean ourselves off of these a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| So, that's all I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Dr. Lyons, I don't know if he.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| Dr. Lyons, did you wish to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| I was just going to address the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| that Commissioner Bussler and Commissioner McKenzie raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| The amount is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| and I guess Commissioner Smith as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| the debt portion, debt service is paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| but there's no increase in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| So, it's a net increase to the county coffers to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| If that, if those dollars end up going to the debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| that frees up other dollars for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| It is a net increase because there's no increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| in county debt associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| There's more money that goes to retire the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| That frees up other money that would otherwise go to the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| that can then be for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Mr. Petrie, my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| I need to back us up for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| back to what I'll call Big Don, the costumers tiff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| that was before us some months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| There was a statement made in that particular application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| that said that this was going to be the gateway to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| and that the design of that particular structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| cost the developer more than would have normally been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| in a project of that magnitude or appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| or financial viability or a lot of other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| that can be thrown in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| I want to ask you that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| about the design of your Regus project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Is it looking better than what you would have built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| on your own or even what you would have built with a tiff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| but for the city ask you to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| which caused the cost of the project to be a little bit larger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| Well, redevelopment and redevelopment districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| are hard for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| First of all, it's because of the blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Second of all, it's because of the limited amount of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| that you have and the prices you pay for that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| which means that typically you have to go vertical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| in a project like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Anytime you go vertical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| although your single-family house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| two stories more efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| when you get beyond that, it's just expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| And so the answer to your question is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| It's just more costly to build these type projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| because there are multiple layers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| because of where they are, the geotechnical is extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| Ultimately, there's bad rock cave systems underground downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| I won't go into all the details and bore you with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| but the bottom line is that it's just more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| to build in that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| You're constrained by zero lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| We actually do a lot of the public right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| In our case, we're rebuilding a whole alley for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| The materials are better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| They're prescribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| You have to use, it has to meet the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| of the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| I'm a fan of that because it keeps consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| It's like in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| the reason you have deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| about the way the houses are supposed to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| We need that in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| but it is more expensive to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| But we're also fans of that because it protects everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| The statement you made about debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| and we could use that elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| That's a very good statement and very fair statement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| I know we're sitting here giving you a hard time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| about TIFs and pilots, but there's something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| and I think you all have looked into this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| but it's something that I could very well support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| is if we could come up with a TIF or a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| to draw a big box grocery store to Magnolia Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| to fill that food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| Yeah, one other very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| On Magnolia, we have before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| and are very strongly considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| investing in infrastructure there to set the stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| for a developer, because we can't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| until a developer comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| All we can do is say, we can invest in infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| tell you we're here with the tools, we'll work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| we'll take this through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| and we very much would love to see the kind of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| along Magnolia that works for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| And you're right, the food desert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| is the biggest challenge there right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| and there's a lot of interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| If a developer can do that as part of a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| that does work for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| we want to make sure those projects work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| for the neighborhood and are economically sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| So I appreciate that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Seeing no further discussion before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| Roll call vote, beginning with Commissioner Oynbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| I guess, point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| the gentleman stood up, I don't know if he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| if it's proper to speak at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| I don't know if you saw me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| I have no one signed up for public forum on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| other than Mr. Petrie and I called on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| Could I, I'm looking to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| to ask for a point of personal preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| if we'd allow him some time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Is that improper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| That's the rules of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| It's not a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| It's whatever this body's rules are set up to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| Okay, so I have a second to allow him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| Call on who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| The gentleman sitting in the front row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| The gentleman on the front row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| Could you move to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| Name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| I apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| I had to come from Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| My name is Joe Levitt, L-E-V-I-T-T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| 825 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| I own about 100 pieces of property in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| and I represent clients as a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| that has several hundred more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| Per se, we are not opposed to the TIF programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| but I ask you to give consideration in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| as to a problem that we're confronted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| Both Knox County in recent years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| is steadily increasing its code enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| which means that as we remodel single family dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| our taxes go up because of the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| that requires a reappraisals every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| Well, the way the TIF programs work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| we don't believe that it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| The high rise buildings that most of these TIF projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5324)|
| 1:28:50| are benefiting require the fire department, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| to maintain and purchase much larger trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| in order to reach up several over 100 feet in the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| but the point is that as taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| of single family dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| our taxes go up if we make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| If we build a new house, we're taxed at the full rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| If Knox County and the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| in the last six or eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| have now given tax incentives and tax rebates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| totaling over $50 million to other developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| and that's okay, we understand why you do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| but is it fair the way you're administering the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| Is it fair to the homeowners throughout the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| and Knox County, particularly in the parts of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| that are in the city where major renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| are being carried out every day on substandard property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| property that has been vacant for several years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| They're forced to by codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| and we're seeing it more and more in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| For example, I had a client receive a notice today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| of a piece of property almost to the Blount County line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| in Knox County on Martin Mill Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| requiring her to redo that property and that will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| but we know that her taxes are gonna go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| We suggest to you that respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| that you give some consideration as to whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| the granting of all these to corporations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| and wealthy investors, whether it's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| fairly administered, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5484)|
| 1:31:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Mr. Levitt, the one thing I can assure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| is that these properties we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| if they do improvements, their taxes are gonna go up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| After this tip period but you of all people should know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| I mean I know you're in the land business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| and you know what it takes to maintain them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| and if it's worth something, it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| paying its fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| Now to go along and not do the repairs on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| so you don't have to pay the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| I'm behind codes 100%, we gotta close them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5529)|

| 1:33:01| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| The vote is nine two in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Number one, requesting the Knox County Purchasing Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| to issue a request for information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| for an electronic voting system for use by the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| subject to the approval of the public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| Two, designating Commissioner Charles Bessler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| to work with the Purchasing Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| to establish a scope of work and or specifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| for the system to be included in the solicitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| And three, authorizing the Purchasing Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| to take all necessary and appropriate steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| to select the most responsive systems for demonstration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| The last time we spoke to this, someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| made a mention that this is a solution looking for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| And I was wondering, you know, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| don't try some new things that update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| the system that we work in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| we wouldn't have the phone we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| We'd have a flip phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| It's just technology that I think that we try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| It's not going to cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| It's something that we might look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| And again, we might like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| And again, we might not like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| But we are not buying anything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| I'm just making the motion that we take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| and that we see how it can benefit us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| If it can benefit us, then we should go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| If it doesn't benefit us, then we vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| And looking at this resolution, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5679)|
| 1:34:46| guess I'm still not in favor of it because, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| But the way it's phrased, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| I'm trying to figure out, so we're going to have an RFI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| And then, as we talked about, that RFI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5703)|
| 1:35:11| is going to be subject to approval from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| And then you're going to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| I guess subsequent to that, the way it's reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| you're going to work with the HEW| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| to establish the scope of work specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5722)|
| 1:35:30| Which probably, I think, puts the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| And maybe these aren't sequential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| But then, we're going to authorize the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| to purchase HEW to take the appropriate steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| for a demonstration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| We had one in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| We didn't pay a dime for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Commissioner Armstrong was probably on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I mean, Law Director Armstrong was probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| on commission at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| We brought one in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| And they didn't take all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| And we demonstrated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| And for whatever reason, we didn't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| So I guess I'm trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| why we're doing all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| But it looks like we're getting ready to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| We're going to exercise the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| We're going to create work for our purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| which is, from what I hear, is already short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| And we're going to engage PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| We're doing a whole lot right now to where, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| you'd probably send a letter of interest out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| to the two or three outfits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| They'd be glad to come in here and demo it for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| or for you all, depending on the time that this comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| I guess I just don't understand why we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| all this in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| We could authorize the chair to go out and find a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| of companies and have them come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Brad's shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| It's over $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| You can't do an RFP on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| Well, let me interject that Commissioner Bustler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| is saying that this resolution is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| going to cost us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Yeah, I'm just saying, he's on a demo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| There's probably a dozen companies or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Well, and I guess my, yeah, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| what you're saying, that you can't bring one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| If it's over $10,000, you're going to bias that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| But so we're going to bring in multiple systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| as a result of this RFI and then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| them come in and demonstrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| To me, it's just a big upset of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| So we're going to have two or three, or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| come in here after the RFI and then try these products off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| And again, I've been here, will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| eight and a half years in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| And we really haven't had an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| And I'm speaking from the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| has voted first a bunch of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| I believe it's Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| And we did have a demonstration of that about four or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| But for the commission by itself to spend that kind of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| for just the commission use alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| I think, is kind of superfluous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| We've got three main groups that use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| We've got county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| We've got city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| We've got NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| School board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Or who's the fourth one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| School board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| Oh, school board, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Sorry, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5908)|
| 1:38:28| BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5909)|
| 1:38:29| BPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| If we're going to get a system like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| I think it needs to be a joint system that everybody can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| so that it's not, you know, spread the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| If we need to authorize a PBA to, you know, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| make the purchase so it's compatible with what they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| you know, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Then everybody, each one of those four or five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| whatever, ponies up part of their budget for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| But to just do it for the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| I think is just superfluous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| You know, I think it's important that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| You know, here's kind of the way I take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| There's 11 of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| We vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5956)|
| 1:39:16| I pretty well think we can do it very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| We can bring 10 people in here, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| not going to be for any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| I think we need to run as efficiently as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| spend as little money as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| And I think we can vote without having more expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5969)|
| 1:39:35| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| I just want to make a motion that we take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| And like I said, it's not costing us anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| And we've already talked to Tom Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| He has given the information about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| they would need for each body to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| how many voting apparatuses it would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| to where each part that uses this room can use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| and see if it's to their benefit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| I'm just saying, if we get it here, they can also use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| and they would like to show it to each body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| So it's not just us, but it's the whole body of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| that does the work in this facility right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| So anyway, do we move forward or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| Are you going to call for a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| He just made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| I just made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6026)|

| 1:40:32| He said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6032)|
| 1:40:32| I just made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| There's already a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| Did you have a motion already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| OK, the motion before us properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| is from Commissioner Bussler, seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6044)|

| 1:40:51| the possibilities of having electronic voting demoed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Are we approving the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| Approving the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Yeah, which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6065)|

| 1:43:38| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| The first discussion item, Commissioner McKenzie, per request of Commissioner Broyles, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| wish to move this to the bottom of the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| Also, before you answer the question, the time is 626.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6229)|

| 1:44:04| You still wish to move the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| I'm sure mine's not going to be long, so I don't mind to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6246)|

| 1:44:31| He's going to send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| What's the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| Yeah, he's going to send a written answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Next discussion item is the Zika virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Zika and West Nile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| I wanted to talk about this because I wanted to give the Health Department and Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| and Public Works an opportunity to maybe get some information out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| I think we're all aware of what's going on with these two diseases and their transmission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| through mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| So, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| My friends from Engineering are going to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| Martha Buchanan, 140 Damron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| So I'm just going to give kind of a situation report on Zika.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| I feel like I'm really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| So most of you are aware that Central and South America have a very significant outbreak of Zika| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| currently going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Also, some U.S. territories like Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands also have ongoing transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| In the United States, we have several cases of Zika in people who've traveled to those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6341)|
| 1:45:48| and come home and been sick and been tested and found to be positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| In the state of Tennessee, there are two cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| None of those cases are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| There's been no mosquito transmission on the mainland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| So no mosquito transmission in the mainland United States, just in those U.S. territories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| And there has been some sexual transmission in the United States and in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| So Zika is a mosquito-borne illness that you get when you get bitten by a mosquito,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| and then you might get a fever, rash, infection in your eyes, and joint pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6380)|
| 1:46:28| However, 80% of the people who get Zika don't have any symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| And the big deal about Zika is not so much the adults that get sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| although we're learning more about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| is that it has been associated with some significant birth defects in women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| and children born to women who have Zika while they're pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| And the main birth defect they're seeing is called microcephaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| And microcephaly is when the head of the infant is very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| And that may not sound like such a big deal, but it causes developmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| It causes seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| It causes these children not to have a normal lifespan and to require a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| So it's quite tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Imagine thinking that you're going to have a normal pregnancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| and having a baby that's born that's abnormal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| So that's been a big piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| Obviously, mosquito season is upon us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| and we are preparing to start doing our West Nile program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| which is a disease prevention program, not really a mosquito elimination program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| Our main focus with Zika is going to be kind of what you're seeing up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| is really educating people about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| In addition to that, educating people about what they can do on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| to eliminate this particular mosquito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| All mosquito-borne illnesses and all mosquitoes are not equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Mosquitoes like different places to lay their eggs and like different places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| And this particular mosquito, the Aedes aegypti mosquito,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| likes to lay its eggs in really shallow water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| like a bottle cap or maybe a flower pot that has some water around the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| Lay its eggs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| They can grow to maturity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| And this mosquito also flies in the daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| And it's not a mosquito that's really prevalent here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| although we do have Aedes mosquitoes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| And the UT, Dr. Frexel at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| who does mosquito research on disease prevention in animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| really hasn't trapped any of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| She's trapped the Aedes albopictus mosquito,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| which is a relative of the Aedes aegypti mosquito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| And the mosquito that causes West Nile virus is called the Culex mosquito,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| and that mosquito likes larger bodies of water to lay its eggs in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| And it does tend to fly at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| and it is easier for us to drive down the street and fog the area in the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| When the temperature is appropriate, air settles down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| and that helps control those mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| And if you're familiar with our mosquito program currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| it really is a West Nile prevention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| So we trap mosquitoes across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| And Andrea, who's doing that program now, and her staff do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| determine the gender, because only female mosquitoes bite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| and then we determine if they're Culex mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| And if they're Culex mosquitoes, we send them to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| and the state tests them and tells us if they're positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| If those mosquitoes are positive, we will spray a radius around that trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| If we get a human case, if we get a bird case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| we will also spray those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| But the biggest piece of prevention happens by individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| It's getting rid of breeding grounds on your property for all kinds of mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| So getting rid of any standing water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| It needs to be dumped at least once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| Wearing mosquito repellent when you're outside during the day and the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| Wearing long clothes that are loose-fitting also helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| And even wearing clothing impregnated with mosquito repellent is also helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6594)|
| 1:50:01| Obviously, in other places, mosquito nets are useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| We don't generally use those because we generally have windows and screens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| so we don't use mosquito nets here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| So that's a really vast, big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| We'll continue to do our regular mosquito program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| which is, again, a West Nile prevention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| These things that you're looking at here are being posted at the airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6621)|
| 1:50:29| so that people who are leaving and coming back are reminded to think about Zika| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| and get tested if they get sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| And testing is available through the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| It has to be approved through the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| We're not doing the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| We have to approve the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| But it also educates people of what to do to prevent mosquito bites while they're traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| We're communicating with travel agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| We also communicate with, like, church groups that send people down to Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| and South America for mission trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| and give them all the information about how to protect themselves against mosquitoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| and what to do if they're pregnant about travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| And so it really is really augmenting what we're already doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| getting more information out to folks about what to do to eliminate the risk of mosquitoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| on their own property and how to protect themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| Now, if somebody comes back and they've recently traveled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| we also talk to them and educate them on what to do to reduce the risk of somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| of us getting local transmission, an Aedes aegypti mosquito biting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| and then biting somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| That's how we get local transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| So we're telling people to stay inside for a couple of weeks, avoid mosquito bites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| Some people can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Again, we haven't had any cases in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| so we haven't had anybody we've had to do that with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| But doing a lot of counseling of folks who want to travel or who have traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| So that's the really fast version of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| So do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| What are we doing about our detention ponds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| About what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Retention and detention ponds that hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Well, I will let Dwight and then possibly Ronnie and Andrea answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6731)|
| 1:52:20| The short answer, Commissioner, is we haven't really considered it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| When a site is under development and the ponds are installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| they are installed per specifications provided by the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| and they are required to hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| A function of that is a sediment gets into the pond, it settles to the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| and only clean water discharges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| Those discharge rates are such that they may or may not intervene with the breeding cycle of the mosquitoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| That's not an area that I have any particular knowledge about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| But in evaluating the functionality of the ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| it is strictly based on compliance with state law and sediment prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| and it doesn't really contemplate what to do with mosquito breeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| The other thing I should mention is that in terms of ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| obviously we are only aware of those that are existing in the construction environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| So other ponds, farm ponds and things like that that are on private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| we'd have no knowledge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Are we doing any kind of inspection program to see if these retention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| and subdivisions are operating properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| Are they holding water that could be breeding grounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| We make sure that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| Quite frankly, remember, again, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| and this is the tricky part of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| in an environment with active construction where dirt is being moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| the ponds are supposed to hold water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| and they are supposed to hold water long enough for the fines to settle out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| and go to the bottom to avoid those being discharged to waters of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| So we are, in fact, looking for, in active construction sites, ponds to hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6833)|
| 1:54:01| We're not actually looking to them not to hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| So in terms of, again, our policies and procedures are all centered on sediment control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6844)|
| 1:54:15| and regulating the construction trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| so they don't really contemplate this in any way, shape, or form that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| Some of the newer regulations on the detention ponds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| aren't we required to hold the first inch of rain until it evaporates or filters naturally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| Yes, sir, but remember there's a different set of standards for post-construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| and then there's a set of standards for during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| During construction, you are supposed to retain water from your site following a rain event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| and then discharge it over seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Again, it may be that that seven-day discharge is sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| to interrupt the breeding cycle of the mosquito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| It is. That's a lucky coincidence on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| It's not something that we've contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Our body of regulation just doesn't deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| It's focused on sediment control and not these kinds of other public health considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| Seeing, oh, sir, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| I'm Ronnie Neese at 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| I'm the Director of Environmental Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| We have contacted the city engineering and the county engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| and they will notify us if there's any new construction going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| We are aware throughout the county we have a list of basically 175 different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| that are retaining water that we do evaluate on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| and if there is mosquito breeding occurring, we do apply a larvicide to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| which doesn't allow the mosquitoes to hatch out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| As I said, we are in contact with the city and county to find any of the new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| The new ones that are under construction, while they are settling at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| do allow breeding, and we are treating those to help alleviate any mosquito breeding going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| But we are aware and we are working constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| We've already started applying larvicide to these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| and will be until the weather subsides in the fall, late October and November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6975)|
| 1:56:23| Seeing no further discussion, thank you, Dr. Buchanan, Mr. Van de Veet, Mr. Neese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6983)|
| 1:56:32| Now back to the top of the list of three there, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=6992)|
| 1:56:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| You know, it wasn't that long ago that we were, you and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7001)|
| 1:56:50| subsequent Commissioners Brown and Anders were pretty new to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| and if you could go back and just track, say, the Knoxville News Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7016)|
| 1:57:04| there was an article on county commission, if not daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| at least four to five times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| And it's because we kind of came in on the heels of Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| We were kind of their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| And what happened was we cleaned this place up in terms of being above reproach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7041)|
| 1:57:30| in terms of how we communicated with each other, and the forums that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| We created electronic forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| You know, we drove Jolie crazy with posting everything that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| and we've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| So why am I bringing this up, this bill to de-annex portions from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| It's because I disagree with the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| No, that's not why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| But the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| This issue came before us in some way, shape, form, or fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| and we, because I did get a call on it, we deliberated over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| And that's, you know, when I say that, I say, no, I'm not supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| That's deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| That process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| We can't condone that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| And, you know, we're better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| We're, we have to be, we have to look at all aspects of an issue before we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7103)|
| 1:58:34| calling other commissioners and deliberating over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| And that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| You like this, don't you not like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| And it came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| So, you know, the same time the issue on diversity was coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| and if I had called you, oh, hey, I really want to send a letter out before this thing comes before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| that would be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| That would have been wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| Likewise, this issue, like I say, so I'm not really concerned with what side I fell on on the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| but the process, if we continue this, this isn't huge, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| but it's kind of like the frog in the pot, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| We'll find ourselves back in, you'll find yourselves back in the situation that we were prior to us taking office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7154)|
| 1:59:22| I strongly feel the county has, the citizens of Knox County has reestablished trust in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7162)|
| 1:59:31| I strongly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| And, again, if we allow these things to continue to happen without saying stop it, don't do that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7173)|
| 1:59:44| I think we're doing ourselves and Knox County and county commission a disservice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7184)|
| 1:59:50| So that's why I brought this forward, not trying to step on anyone, but this was wrong, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| I don't care who did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| This process was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| We can get passionate about issues all we want, but we've got to go through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| and this was not done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| Seeing no further discussion, I do have a couple of items that need to be brought before us in the form of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7210)|
| 2:00:18| Commissioner Brown, I'd like you to think about last Thursday on Chapman Highway and address that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7218)|
| 2:00:28| Valley Grove Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| The May calendar, I just want to reemphasize a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7232)|
| 2:00:39| Monday, May the 9th, the mayor's presentation of the budget will be in this room at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7239)|
| 2:00:53| The following week, Monday, May the 16th, our work session is at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7253)|
| 2:01:07| We will have a work session on the budget at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| Our work session will be at 5 p.m., and at 6.30, we will have a public hearing on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7274)|
| 2:01:29| And then I want to reemphasize one other issue that came up later that will come up in the next month, June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7289)|
| 2:01:39| because we heard today at Beer Board the number of people that will be before us in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7299)|
| 2:01:47| Beer Board will convene at 3 p.m. instead of its regular 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7307)|
| 2:01:57| By, I think, unanimous vote, we wish to change the meeting of the June Beer Board to 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7317)|
| 2:02:14| I also wish to notice that the Office of Commission will be closed on May the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7334)|
| 2:02:23| It's Memorial Day, and I'd also like to recognize that on May the 21st, it's Armed Forces Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7343)|
| 2:02:35| Now then, I asked Commissioner Brown if he would try to remember the meeting, Chapman Highway, this past Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7355)|
| 2:02:44| You want it verbatim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| Good, because that ain't what you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| Last Thursday evening at, well, from 5 to 7, according to the newspaper, and I tend to agree because the church was pretty full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7373)|
| 2:03:02| around 250 people showed up for a Q&A, mostly information on the TDOT developments on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7382)|
| 2:03:16| The only thing really that that meeting that involves Knox County is from Henders Chapel Road to Simpson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7396)|
| 2:03:30| That's the only portion that will be affected at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| Supposedly that one will go on out for bids in the fall, hopefully, and hopefully late 17, early 18, they'll be able to do the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7416)|
| 2:03:47| However, there's another little portion in Knox County from Simpson Road to the county line that is already on the drawing board and being worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7427)|
| 2:04:01| Let me go back for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| The big reason for the delay on the portion between Henders Chapel and Simpson Road is if you travel that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7443)|
| 2:04:11| there's going to be quite a bit of land acquisition have to be done because they're going to have to chisel off some mountains and fill in some valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7451)|
| 2:04:19| Most of you know that road's built right against the mountain as it goes around there, a lot of rocky walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| So it's going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| At the same time, they have, part of it's underway right now, but will be ongoing this year and early part of next year through Seymour area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7467)|
| 2:04:37| Eventually, hoping to be four lanes with a turn lane from basically John Sevier Highway all past Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7477)|
| 2:04:49| So that's kind of where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| It was an informative meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| I think that Commissioner Brown asked if he would live the three years to see this particular one of four little projects be finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7496)|
| 2:05:05| and I said he won't live three years if he tries to make a left-hand turn on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7505)|
| 2:05:13| if you try to make a left-hand turn anywhere out there in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| I appreciate the state being here, having that public meeting, and having those four projects underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| Yes, sir, an announcement, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| They're redoing the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| They're having a public meeting tomorrow, the 26th, at Hardin Valley Academy at 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| and also on Tuesday, May 3rd, they're having one at the Carnes Community Center at 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| So if you're interested in seeing that, I think it has been a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| So it will be out at Hardin Valley Academy tomorrow night at 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| and then next Tuesday, May 3rd at 7.30 at the Carnes Community Center on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| I just want to make a quick announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Tomorrow I'll be doing one of my listening days at the Frank Strange Senior Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7557)|
| 2:06:03| from 9.30 in the morning to 11.30 to interact with the folks out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| and it will be myself only as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| No other commissioners will be present, so we didn't sunshine that, and the press is not welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| Are there other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| Seeing no further discussion, we've beat the deadline by one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| You're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| I call this meeting of the April Board of Zonings to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7595)|

| 2:07:10| Eleven members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| The record, I was fumbling through my stack of papers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| and I've been called by the clerk to say that it may be a little bit late to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| but I'm going to read from the Knox County Commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7644)|
| 2:07:32| I've been trying to do this in the past, so I want everyone to know the process by which we try to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7652)|
| 2:07:40| Individual matters will be called by the chair or the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| I will ask if the applicant is here, if there is opposition, and we will then hear the report from MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7666)|
| 2:07:57| Then the applicant will address commission, the opposition, and the applicant and the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| until we have a fairly clear picture of the record that's being built before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7685)|
| 2:08:14| at which time county commissioners may ask questions, may discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| We will sit and discuss and deliberate these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| Then there will be a motion, hopefully followed by a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7705)|
| 2:08:32| And after that particular point in time, I'm reading from the rules of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| deliberations shall not be interrupted from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| Commissioners, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| Madam Clerk, read the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7728)|

| 2:08:55| from MDR Medium Density Residential to C Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| property located northeast side of Old Clinton Pike, southeast of West Beaver Creek Drive, Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7739)|
| 2:09:06| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| Tommy Hunt, one of the partners in Callaway Hunt Real Estate, 1313 Turnberry Lane in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7750)|
| 2:09:17| Thank you, Mr. Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| And Mr. Hunt, is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| The MPC recommended on a vote of 10 to 2, with 2 abstaining on the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| that the commission approve the requested amendment to the Northeast West County Sector Plan to commercial for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7777)|
| 2:09:44| It is a .6 acre property within the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| The commission found that the proposed plan amendment would be a logical extension of the adjacent plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7788)|
| 2:09:55| and one of the two subject properties is currently zoned CA, general business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| and this amendment will bring the sector plan into conformity with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7800)|
| 2:10:08| Seeing no discussion, do I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| Motion to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7812)|

| 2:10:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Request of Callaway Hunt Real Estate LLC for rezoning from RB, general residential, to CA, general business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7829)|

| 2:10:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7845)|

| 2:10:50| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, the MPC recommended that the rezoning be approved by a vote of 10 to 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7852)|
| 2:10:59| with those 2 abstaining on the consent agenda, no public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| The commission found that the CA zoning is consistent with the growth policy plan as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7863)|
| 2:11:09| Motion to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7869)|

| 2:11:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| Thank you, Mr. Hunt, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| Thank you. Look forward to getting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7890)|

| 2:11:50| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7910)|
| 2:11:54| Mr. Chairman, the attorney for that called me just a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| and said that he would like to move it to the back, that they've got people on the way to take care of these two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7918)|
| 2:12:03| If there be no objection, this item and the following item will be moved to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7923)|
| 2:12:12| Hearing no objection, Madam Clerk, the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7932)|

| 2:13:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| The MPC voted by a vote of 12-0 to amend the northwest county sector plan to C for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7983)|
| 2:13:11| and recommended that the county commission do likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| The property in question is a 3.1 acre property located in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=7994)|
| 2:13:20| The commission found that the commercial use of the subject property, if limited to PC zoning, is appropriate for the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8000)|
| 2:13:28| It's located along a major arterial street and is just south of other commercially developed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| Motion to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8020)|
| 2:13:47| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8027)|

| 2:13:55| Madam Clerk, next part of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| 3D16RZ, request of Richard DeFrancisco for rezoning from A, Agricultural, T.O., Technology Overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8038)|
| 2:14:06| to C.A., General Business, T.O., Technology Overlay, property located west side of Lovell Road, south of Yarnell Road, District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8046)|
| 2:14:15| Seeing the councilor still standing before us and hearing no opposition earlier, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8055)|
| 2:14:24| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, the MPC recommended by vote of 12-0 that the property be rezoned to Planned Commercial Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8064)|
| 2:14:33| The applicant, as stated on the agenda, requested C.A. with Technology Overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8073)|
| 2:14:40| The commission found that the planned commercial zoning would be a logical extension and appropriate for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8080)|
| 2:14:47| The planned commercial zoning would allow the staff to review the plans for development of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| and recommend landscaping, lighting, access, and signage to assure that the development would be compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8093)|
| 2:15:01| The applicant is proposing to exclude a 130-foot wide buffer area along the northwest portion of the site plan from the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8101)|
| 2:15:11| That buffer would remain zoned Agricultural with Technology Overlay and would provide separation from the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8111)|
| 2:15:20| They recommended C.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8120)|
| 2:15:24| C.A., I'm sorry, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| With the P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| P.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| Conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| Conditions, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Sorry, I have enough papers to read that sometimes it gets confusing to see who did what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8131)|
| 2:15:37| Mr. Seymour, there was a C.A. zoning with the P.C. conditions on lighting, site plan review for lighting, landscaping, and other site development characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8137)|
| 2:15:47| Mr. Chairman, I make a motion we approve for M.P.C. recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| Yes, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| The gentleman has something in the bag that looks like he put a lot of work in, and I'd like for him to have the opportunity to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| You just cost him money with Arthur speaking on his behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| If I may, Richard, do you want to explain what you've done to protect the development and the surrounding neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8172)|
| 2:16:23| One of the main things that attracted my wife and I to developing this site is because we liked the natural beauty of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| before it went into the mess that it's fallen into in the last 15 years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8189)|
| 2:16:37| There's an existing house that was built in 1958, an existing barn that was built in 1958, and it's our plan to work around those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8197)|
| 2:16:44| and make it look like a farm like it used to be, even though we do automotive repair there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8204)|
| 2:16:50| We're trying to keep the East Tennessee personality into that area, which is rapidly getting mowed over by everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8210)|
| 2:16:57| So that's why we picked this site, and we appreciate you guys making the accommodation to CA because that allowed the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8217)|
| 2:17:05| We obviously have no problem with PC, but that allowed us with the setback to develop the site without destroying the beauty of the area that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8225)|
| 2:17:13| If I may add, excuse me, Mr. Seymour, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| The planning commission was in total agreement and understood the need for the CA zoning in order to reduce setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8237)|
| 2:17:25| in order to better protect and to develop the property more compatibly with the surrounding environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8245)|
| 2:17:33| And I might add there's a barn up here right there that he's going to rehabilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8253)|

| 2:18:04| All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8284)|

| 2:18:16| Counselor, good luck. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| Madam Clerk. 3E16SP, request of Dr. Cary Bentley for a southwest county sector plan amendment from LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8302)|
| 2:18:30| low density residential to O office property located south side of Choteau Road, east side of South North Shore Drive, District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8310)|
| 2:18:39| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| Yes. Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8322)|
| 2:18:50| I am here on behalf of the applicant along with Dr. Cary McFarland and Mr. Danny Overby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8330)|
| 2:19:00| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| The Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended by a vote of 8 to 4 that the county commission adopt the amendment to the southwest county sector plan to office for this .9 acre property located in the planned growth area on the southwest corner of the intersection of Choteau Road and North Shore Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8352)|
| 2:19:33| The commission found that office uses at this site are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8373)|
| 2:19:39| The site is located at the edge of the traffic circle. The commission found that the development of that site for low density residential as proposed in the current sector plan would not be feasible given the traffic and the location there at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8379)|
| 2:19:54| The commission also felt that the office use would be a reasonable transition between the commercial uses to the north and the surrounding residential areas in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8394)|
| 2:20:05| I'd like to apologize. I wrote a quick memo outlining the planning commission's actions on this and the reason for their action and the staff recommendation, and I inadvertently put southeast corner of the intersection instead of the southwest, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8405)|
| 2:20:25| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Arthur Seymour, are you representing this client? Do you wish to speak as the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| May I ask a question? May I lead off and have my clients? Dr. McFarland has a brief statement she would like to make, and Mr. Overby and I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8433)|
| 2:20:46| I think maybe the opponents have several people that want to speak. They may not, but can I ask for the ground rules on this, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8446)|
| 2:20:57| They may open with their statement, and then we will take a statement from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| You may speak if you wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| All right. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| This is a piece of property, as Mr. Green explained, that is unsuited for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8470)|
| 2:21:18| Our clients proposed to open a family medical clinic on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| Mr. Danny Overby, whose family has owned Kimmel Jewelers, one of Knoxville's oldest businesses, would develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8484)|
| 2:21:31| Dr. McFarland, a well-trained medical profession, would operate the clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| It would cater to ñ it would be a family clinic catering to people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| They initially met with Choteau Mills and the commissioner from that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| Everything seemed fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| Then, for some reason, somebody decided this was going to be a pill mill, a methadone clinic, no telling what else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8509)|
| 2:21:59| something that would attract bad characters from all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| My question is, why would you do it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| I want to explain a few truths about this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| Several people hiding behind the supposed anonymity of the Internet have spread rumors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8531)|
| 2:22:18| that this is going to be everything from a pill mill, methadone clinic, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8538)|
| 2:22:26| Dr. McFarland is not going to risk her medical reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| This is a place for a family medical clinic that would treat people from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8550)|
| 2:22:37| The allegations are completely false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| However, the damage was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| You all have undoubtedly received numerous e-mails making allegations that have no basis in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8562)|
| 2:22:49| My clients have tried to meet with neighborhood representatives after the initial meeting with Choteau Mills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8569)|
| 2:22:55| and have not had the opportunity to explain what is going on to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| They have asked repeatedly to meet with various neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| They have given their names and phone numbers where you can reach them 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| and they have received very few calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| They, like I, have received some calls when I have explained the situation to the caller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8594)|
| 2:23:20| They said, well, that's fine. That's a great idea for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| But what Dr. McFarland is faced with is what Winston Churchill noted years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8611)|
| 2:23:38| and that's what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Now the opponents, although they are trying to argue, well, she's going to give Suboxone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| and she will state that she's not going to prescribe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| She wants to do a family medical practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| There was nonetheless an article on one of the news channels today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| supported and encouraged by opponents to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| making the same allegations that this is going to be a pill mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8639)|
| 2:24:04| The simple fact is it's going to be a medical clinic catering to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8644)|
| 2:24:09| It was recommended by the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| It was recommended by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8652)|
| 2:24:16| would prohibit the operation of a pain clinic or a pill mill at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8656)|
| 2:24:26| They have also raised some issue on covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| I would ask you not to be confused by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| I have talked to the lawyer who drafted those, and she said this lot isn't even included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| and she writes title insurance and is willing to insure against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| MPC's attorney, Steve Wise, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| has said that covenants and restrictions are not to be considered in a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8687)|
| 2:24:55| You look at the land use issues only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| There's a lot of information about Jacksboro, which I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| I don't think Dr. McFarland, have you ever worked in Jacksboro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| She's an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| May I have her speak a minute, or should I wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| No, she may speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8714)|
| 2:25:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| Name and address for the record, and please speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| My name is Dr. Carrie McFarland Bentley, P.O. Box 51744.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| Zip is 37950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| I have a brief statement that I'd like to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| I wanted to try and explain what our plans and also our dreams for this clinic are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| I know that there has been a lot said, and the rumors have been rampant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| and I am sorry if I have in any way caused this community to be upset or feel threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| I live here, too, with my two sons, and I'm raising them in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| I want nothing but the best for them and also the community that I now call home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| I fear that my professional choices that I have made throughout my career have caused concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| and I'm sorry for that, but I think if you understand why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| you would understand why I'm longing to get back to being a family physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| I will start off by setting the record straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| This will not be, nor ever will be, an addiction, methadone, or pain management clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8778)|
