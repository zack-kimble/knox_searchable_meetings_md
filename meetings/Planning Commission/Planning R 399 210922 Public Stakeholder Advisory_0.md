| 0:00:30| Good morning, everyone. Looks like we might have one or two people who are logging on here, but it's 1030, 1031. We'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| Hope everyone's doing well. I was hoping we could have this meeting in person, but I think this will have to suffice. So I appreciate you all making time to join us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=38)|

| 0:00:55| We're not going to do introductions via Zoom. I find that to be sometimes somewhat challenging. I think most people might know each other, but there'll be an opportunity for conversation a little later in our meeting today. But we are going to do a roll call, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=55)|
| 0:01:08| A roll call, and then we're going to discuss the minutes from May of last year. We do need a vote on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=68)|
| 0:01:17| And then we're going to review the stakeholder committee tasks, the 13 tasks that were assigned to you all and were part of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=77)|
| 0:01:24| That Dory sent out earlier this week, and then we'll have a discussion and next steps and nobody signed up for public forum, but we can have additional discussion if you all wish. Does that sound okay to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=84)|
| 0:01:36| Dory, could you do roll call? I will do. Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=96)|

| 0:03:06| And we'll go ahead and get started. So one thing that we need to do, as I mentioned, is the approval of the minutes from the May 2020 meeting. Has everybody had a chance to take a look at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=186)|
| 0:03:18| I move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| And who was the second? Was that Sam Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=208)|

| 0:04:30| As well as providing that direct conduit to staff who are developing and updating the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| And so as a condition of approval, the new zoning code that was adopted on August 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| 2019, this committee was to continue to meet for two years to guide the implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| and address 13 key issues that were identified by council during the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| So I'm going to review the status of the 13 priority tasks assigned to this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| and you will find that list in your packet. I'll also have them up on the screen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| And you'll also find a list of all the zoning amendments to date. We sent out a spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| of all those. Only the ones in green are associated with the work of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| but I feel like it was really important to show you that, you know, as we mentioned early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| in the update of this code, this is a living document, and we'll continue to refine it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| as those needs present themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| So I'm going to move on to item number one, which is the parking of operable buses on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| And I'm going to move on to item number two, which is the parking of operable buses on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| So item number one, the review of this item resulted in amendments adopted in March of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=335)|
| 0:05:42| which included standards to allow parking of operable buses on property on which a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| or school is located subject to certain location screening requirements. And the new standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| be located. Item number two, this was originally, this committee voted not to recommend any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=354)|
| 0:06:03| to the sign code to include specific standards for the institutional district. However, at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| request of council in the summer of 2020, planning worked with representatives from the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| health care institutions, Council Member Roberto and Scenic Knoxville to develop sign standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| in the district. These amendments were adopted in June of this year and included standards specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| to the institutional district, as well as provisions to address the unique needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| health care institutions with an emergency room. And at any time, if you all have any questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| comments that you'd like to make, feel free to pop in, raise your hand. If you raise your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| hand and I don't see it, just feel free to jump in. Item three, the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=404)|
| 0:06:52| approved a process for initiating and undertaking a zoning study on November 14, 2019. I'm happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| to review this with you or send it out to you, but there is a formal process for initiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| zoning studies or planning studies. So we feel like this one was taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| Item number four, storage yards were deleted as a special use in the CD district in April 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| for the recommendation of this committee. Item five, this committee recommended no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| to this item on January 22, 2020. Item six, so we've only had one plan development go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=441)|
| 0:07:31| this two-step process. You know, there's a plan development includes a preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| plan as well as the final plan. So Volunteer Ministry is the only applicant who's gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| this entire process to date, and that's Caswell Manor. And they just recently had a ribbon cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| in mid-August. We have had one project, Galbraith School in South Knoxville, go through the preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| plan process, but they have not submitted their final plan. And then just this past month, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Planning Commission recommended council members submit their final plan. So we've only had one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=478)|
| 0:08:06| approve the preliminary plan for the McHugh Stadium project, and it'll be considered at council next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| month. So this is an ongoing task for staff. We'll continue to monitor this and make adjustments as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| necessary. Item number seven, on April 22nd of last year, the committee voted to recommend no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=497)|
| 0:08:27| increase in the minimum lot size in the RN-2 district from 5,000 square feet to 6,000 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| feet. And then there's also consideration of the new single-family residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| the minimum lot size of 7,500. So the committee voted to not recommend any increase in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| minimum lot size in the RN-2. However, Director Green, my predecessor, did recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| studying that additional study might be necessary to look at a new residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| and the committee voted to accept that staff recommendation related to the creation of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| single-family residential district to be further studied. At this point, this task requires no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| further action by the committee, but this is something that staff intends to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| monitor and take a closer look at through the winter and the spring of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=553)|
| 0:09:22| Item number eight, staff proposed a minor amendment to the code to add clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| language for landscape design standards and parking lot perimeter landscape yard in August of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| 2020. Again, this is an ongoing staff task. Staff will continue to monitor the implementation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| landscape requirements for parking areas, and this task requires no further action by the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| at this time. Item number nine, staff will continue to review and analyze the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| housing permitted in these new zones, and for the application of RN-3 and RN-4, there had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| some discussion about, you know, should the application of these zones be expanded. We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| not recommend a general rezoning, but staff does believe they should be permitted in more areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| of the city to promote what is often referred to as the missing middle. These are housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| that are compatible in scale with single-family housing types, but range from duplexes to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| homes to small multi-unit or clustered housing developments. Again, this is an ongoing task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| and it really ties into number seven on your list, you know, the need to really look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=622)|
| 0:10:30| did we miss something? Do we need to add another zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| Item number 10, the code was amended on July 28th of last year to assign responsibilities for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| of applications for the Infill Housing Overlay District, who reviews applications for conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| to the heart of Knoxville Infill Housing Design Guidelines to the Design Review Board, formerly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| called the Downtown Design Review Board, and to add to the board a non-rotating position for the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| Tennessee Community Design Center or their successor, and so that was approved last summer of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| Item number 11, April 22nd of 2020, this committee recommended administration of the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=671)|
| 0:11:20| Overlay provisions be provided by planning staff with requests for deviations considered by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| planning commission. This ordinance was updated on July 28th of 2020, and this is currently in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| in the practices that planning staff does review initial requests for development in the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=691)|

| 0:11:48| Item number 12, based on the extensive input into the signed code in 2015, any further study or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| refinement of this signed ordinance should be delegated to a signed task force. This was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| discussed at length by my predecessor, Gerald Green, during meetings with this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| and I'm honestly not aware of any specific issues arising out of the adoption of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| code related to signs that needs to be addressed at this point. We feel like we addressed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| major one that was the institutional district zone, and that was addressed this past summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| so we feel like this is completed by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| Item 13 is one that staff has been monitoring over the last year and a half since the code took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| effect. The planning commission is going to be considering amendments required to design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| and the CG sometime in the next few months, both at the direction of city council as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| planning commission, and the city and planning staff will continue to monitor and address any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| additional issues that might be arising with compliance with design standards and the review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| that staff has been tasked with. So does anybody, I'm going to pause here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| because we went through the 13 items. Does anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| I can't see everybody on the same screen here. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Head nods. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Quiet group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| So I just wanted to summarize, because we do have some ongoing tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| and, you know, planning and city staff are committed to that work, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| and as we mentioned throughout the update of the zoning code, it's not meant to be stagnant. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| don't want it to be stagnant. It needs to be something that we are constantly looking at to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| make sure that it's meeting its intended goals and that amendments happen when necessary. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=821)|
| 0:13:51| in summary, the committee of this work has been completed. The work that you were assigned when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| the code was adopted in 2019 has concluded. And as we have said, again, from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| we'll continue to treat this as a living document. And the items that you see there on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| I won't go through them because we just went, we just did just go through them. But we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| continue to monitor all these items and additional things are currently on our list as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| you know, to consider going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| So with that, I'm going to ask the committee, are you satisfied with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=860)|
| 0:14:32| what you've accomplished in terms of what you were assigned with back in 2019?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| Amy, I'd like to ask a question here. Was the list supposed to ever grow with public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=879)|
| 0:14:49| comments that were to be made at meetings during this two-year post-adoption period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=889)|
| 0:15:00| Or was the agreement that the list was fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=900)|
| 0:15:08| And John, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| The reason I ask that, it's not a low, it's a, maybe it's a loaded question. But the reason I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| ask that, it's, there's been over a year and a half of no meetings. And so therefore, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| been no process for public input, which I have heard many public input questions about, can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=920)|
| 0:15:31| amend these things or can these things be tweaked? And I know that's been the goal. It's a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| document, as you've stated. And I felt that this steering committee was the public's conduit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=936)|
| 0:15:47| to get things adjusted that were happening in the real world as the zoning code was being applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| So my concern is, and the concern of others in the general public that I speak with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| have not been heard because there have been no meetings. So I know we have been meeting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=961)|
| 0:16:10| or been on this committee for quite some time, but we haven't done anything in a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| And so my concern is that the public has not been heard because the public venue has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=976)|
| 0:16:24| taken away from them. Have you had any other comments similar to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| No, not specifically that there's not been a public opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| provide input on needs of, things that might need to change via the code. And I realize that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| haven't met. And last year was a challenging year. We had a transition, a significant transition here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| at our agency, but also with COVID made it really challenging. And, you know, when this list was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| handed off, it was, these are the 13 items that this committee is tasked with addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| I will say that's one of the reasons I included that, the other spreadsheet that identifies other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| zoning amendments that have been initiated. And there's other opportunities for the public to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| weigh in and, you know, in order to address the needs in the code. So the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| itself and council, so when I mentioned the CG district, that's come up with a couple different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| issues where applicants have wanted to move forward. The properties have been zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| the general commercial CG2, CG3, which have all the same uses that have different dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| design standards. And so, and that was challenging for those particular applicants. And out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| came a request for planning to reevaluate the lack of design standards in CG1 and be able to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| out and add that back in. And so that's something that we're going to be addressing. And in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| to that is taking a closer look at dimensional standards for CG2 and CG3 and do those really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| make sense or are we preventing redevelopment of some smaller lots. So that's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| The institutional science standards, we continued that conversation after, you know, the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| met and discussed and had quite a bit of additional public community input through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| St. Knoxville and the hospitals and had a workshop specifically on that item as well as the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| development with city council. And so additional public input was provided as part of that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| and we did move forward with some minor amendments associated with those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| So again, like I said, we are definitely committed. I don't want to necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| speak for Peter, but I think my experience has been, you know, both planning and city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| When we come across issues and when we hear from community members or applicants that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| take a closer look at things, we're trying to be as proactive as possible. We have a list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| additional things to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| Right. And what is, for the general public, what is that? I mean, when I say general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| the people that deal with this, you know, let's call it somebody that wants to build a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| family house in a traditional neighborhood or something like that. And they're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| dimensional standard problems with lot sizes of existing conditions and things of that nature and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| exemptions that should be in the code and codified so that additional variance hearings aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| still occurring, which was one of the reasons why we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| I feel like we haven't moved the needle as much to alleviate some of those additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| variances and hoops if we don't get these nuances and exemptions codified in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| that brings it all to our attention at once and once being as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| And again, having a conduit for the general public on a regularly scheduled meeting was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| the agreement. And that hasn't happened. So I don't feel that the general public has had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| opportunity to do that. I hear you talking about some bigger issues that are like CG2 and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| but that's big developers coming to you with big projects and you're paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| How do we make sure that somebody that's, you know, creating housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1225)|
| 0:20:33| let's say, on that scale, a smaller scale developer is being heard and these nuances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| are being addressed in an open forum similar to the RECODE process prior to adoption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| So again, I just want to make sure a lot of people have come to me and I said, well, bring those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| to this meeting. Well, this meeting hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| So are you suggesting process? And I have somebody else with a hand up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| but I wanted to follow up. Are you suggesting that this committee continue to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| I feel like the messaging needs to be clear that we did not perform what we said we were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| do. I said, I know we've done the 13 on the list, and I think that's fantastic, but we haven't given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| that open forum that was promised. And I feel, you know, my commitment to the two years was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| really so that we could listen and hear, and we haven't done that. So I'm wondering if that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1289)|
| 0:21:38| result to continue some regularly scheduled input session so we can hear these causes and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| and deliberate them and make recommendations in a formal setting so that planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| isn't being inundated and you guys get to it when you can get to it, because again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| that's the way it will happen. You guys will always be too busy to do that, and you should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| So again, the burden of this was to be on this committee so that we could make these clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| recommendations with the, you know, this membership that's, you know, represented pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| well on this committee. So if that is an extension of time, I don't see why we shouldn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1336)|
| 0:22:24| because we didn't. We didn't meet at least, I think we were meeting every other month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| so that would be at least eight meetings that we didn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Amy? Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| Yeah, one second. I have Mr. Browns had his hand up for quite some time, and then Duane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| I'll come to you. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| I think we may be getting to the question I was going to ask. I was just simply going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| for someone that possibly is looking at doing a small-scale development, possibly for housing or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| maybe even a church, and let's just say their zone for something, how would they go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| getting their zone amended so they can move forward with that? But it looks like we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| arrive at that answer through this conversation. Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| Well, in terms of the rezoning process, that has not changed. So if someone wants to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| if there's something they want to do in the zone that they're currently in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| they would come to the Planning Commission to request an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| to change their zoning district to allow the use that they would like. So that's not within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| the purview of this committee. That would go through its regular process that we've had for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| years. Thanks. That makes sense. Yeah. Duane? Yeah, Amy, I share John's concern in the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| that the committee was put together for a two-year period to have these meetings. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| of course, we've really lost a year and a half, and it's not, it's through the fault of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| pandemic and this sort of thing. And I think that either the committee ought to continue to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| we really do the two years and we have the public input and have the availability of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| to meet with the community and people that do have concerns. I've had several comments where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| people say they do have some additional concerns that we probably should, as a committee member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| I should probably bring those to the group. But I do think that, in essence, what's happened is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| we formed a committee to work for two years, and basically we worked, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| six months or eight months, something like that. And so I don't see any reason why we can't extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| it and really be committed to the two years that we have. And because the new code has been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| for the two years, we have even a better opportunity to make changes that are coming up and that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| see. So I would be most in favor of extending the committee, whether it's a year and a half or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| another two years or whatever, depending on who wants to serve on it. But I would certainly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| willing to serve. And as I said, I have the same kind of concerns that John has in terms of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| we are and what this is all about. So my recommendation would be that we do extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| the time for this committee. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Amy, this does me well, so I'll just jump in here and just say this feedback is really helpful. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| I also appreciate everyone understanding that the last year, the 18 months, has been really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| unprecedented for everyone. So we adopted a new code, changed the administration, huge changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| at planning. And as you can see by the report that Amy provided, there's been a lot of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| that there has been a whole lot going on to address the 13 items that were identified on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| front end. And additional items that I would say range from, you know, concerns with the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1546)|
| 0:25:56| and the way that larger projects can be developed and also smaller and residential projects. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1556)|
| 0:26:04| I know everyone acknowledges that and you know that people haven't been just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| not paying attention to some of the concerns that have been brought to us. I do think that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| have to talk. The feedback that you provided is super helpful. I always celebrate when people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| want to have more meetings. It's unusual. So the fact that this group and the folks that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| heard from have that level of dedication is really incredible. This committee was formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1591)|
| 0:26:40| through appointment by the mayor, and it was at the time, Mayor Rojero. We have a new administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| and now and that was brought forth in a resolution to city council. So we will take your feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1607)|
| 0:26:56| on this matter. I hear what you're saying. There was a long time without meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| You know, it sounds like there's some additional information that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| that you'd like to share and have discussed by this group. So we just need to take that feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| back to the mayor and make a decision about how to proceed. So I just want you to know that we hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| you. If for some reason, you know, anything changes in our approach, I want to be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| with you. Our plan, because we have so many different mechanisms for receiving input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| whether it's through planning commission, council, or through a variety of stakeholders who interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| with both planning and with plans review and inspection, we hadn't, you know, planned on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| keeping the committee going. We were sort of planning on winding things down, but we hear you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| and I don't think I'm prepared to respond to that right now. I need to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| internally in the administration. But again, thanks so much for the feedback, and it's hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| to believe that it's been that long since we've met, given the amount of work that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| So thanks, everybody. Thank you, Stephanie. And I just want to reiterate, if any of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| have any questions or concerns or hearing concerns or questions, you can always give me a call at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| any time, and I'm happy to have those conversations with you and discuss what we can do as staff to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| help address those. And I know Peter is the same. I mean, I know he's very open to anything related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| to permitting on his side or anything related to zoning variances that are necessary. So, Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| I hope I'm not misspeaking for you, but I know both departments are very committed to making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| sure that this zoning ordinance works in this meeting. Anybody else have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1732)|
| 0:29:05| Well, that's all we have for today. We will definitely be in touch. Mary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1745)|
| 0:29:14| I just want to add my voice to John's and Duane's. We had several things that are coming up big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1754)|
| 0:29:26| these days, so I'd like to plan development. And it seems appropriate, given how this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| the first attempt to apply the new code in several ways, that it would make sense to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| continue with this route or at least occasionally get together. So, goodbye to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1788)|
| 0:30:01| No other hands up. Again, thank you all for your time today, and we'll definitely be in touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| regarding any next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210922-public-stakeholder-advisory?start=1807)|
